**TLDR:**

Common goods are goods that are for everyone to use like parks, libraries, and oxygen. In the physical world, common goods are destroyed because no one has the incentive to take care of them. Today in the DeFi world it can be different because we have an incentive to want to take care of them. Participatory economics functions via a token-based ecosystem where the token is an incentive to affect people's behaviors and encourage them to do good in these public goods that we are creating. 

# What are common goods?

**Public Goods:** There is a little bit more of a barrier here as you need to fit certain criteria to join this space like a country club where you need to get memberships or you need to have X amount of qualifications or X amount of attributes to be able to join this public goods community.  


**Common goods:** On the other hand, common goods are goods that are for everyone to use so you don't need to be a superstar or a supermodel and everyone like you and me can just join and enjoy it. Examples of common goods in the real physical world are parks, libraries, and oxygen. These are infrastructures given either by the world like water or built by a country system or a nation-state like parks and libraries.

Lesson one in economics is that there's no such thing as free lunch and there's an opportunity cost to everything.

## Incentive Misalignment: How do common goods fall into this category of no such thing as free lunch?

Common goods are very difficult to maintain. For example, water is free for everyone to use but look at all the water pollution that occurs. If you look at who is cleaning up the water or who is taking care of these common goods you will see that not many people are doing that because they are not incentivised to do it. Economics is mainly about incentives and how these affect different people's behaviors. In that sense, one of the biggest problems with common goods is that there is an incentive misalignment and people are not incentivised to want to take care of things.","self","https://redd.it/rt6w3u"

**TLDR**:

With some of the above analysis, centralised exchanges have the ability to use complex calculations without worrying about costs to create many complex derivatives. However, with decentralised exchanges, they are limited in this ability, so they focus on a single niche and improve their products slowly.

FTX is one of the leading derivatives exchanges when it comes to creating unique (but also ""dangerous"") products. Meanwhile, Mirror and Synthetix are more specialised in a particular market. Technological capabilities do not meet current needs.

In terms of synthetic products, all three exchanges are competing with each other. FTX simply collateralises real-life assets and tokenises them. Synthetix mortgages $SNX again for $Synths. Mirror is more diversified in collaterals to generate $mAssets.

# General Conclusion

Today we will discuss platforms that offer a variety of derivative products. Our approach will go from off-chain to on-chain and outline the benefits and drawbacks of each platform.

In addition, we also analyse aspects related to token design. We will have a closer look at each of the tokens that make up the platform.

In this article, we focus on three main platforms: TFX ($FTT), Synthetix ($SNX) and Mirror ($MIR). All three protocols deal with derivatives. How are they different? How are they the same? How are they successful?

 

# What are Derivatives?

>Contract based on underlying asset

A derivative is a financial transaction **contract** between two or more parties **based on** a change in the future value of an **underlying asset**. That underlying asset can be a tangible asset, an index, or an interest rate. Derivatives themselves have no intrinsic value.

>Assets: Gold, silver, precious metals, coffee, rice. Index: Stocks, bonds, interest rates.

That is, users transact based on a change in the value of another entity rather than directly owning that entity. Profit is generated based on the spread and price movement of the underlying asset.

Derivatives trades have been around since medieval times, between merchants. The first base assets used were olives and food.

In derivatives trading, there are four basic types of contracts:

* **Forwards** Contract: An agreement to trade between two parties at a specified time in the future. The price is determined and agreed upon by both parties in the present.
* **Futures** Contract: This is a standardised form of forwarding contract and listed for trading on official exchanges.  
For example: In the US, there is the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).
* **Option**: A contract in which one party has the right to require the other party to perform the obligation to buy or sell an amount of the underlying asset at a specified price on or before a certain date.
* **Swap**: An agreement between two parties A and B in which they exchange the cash flow of party A's financial instrument with the cash flow of party B's financial instrument for a certain period of time.

Crypto derivatives are only a few years old. In the following sections, we will learn in detail about derivatives trading in crypto which will help us to make a profit in this type of crypto market.

 

# What are Crypto Derivatives?

>Short Answer: Crypto-based derivatives are dependent on change in value of crypto tokens

Simply put, you will trade with each other based on the price of tokens. You will not be directly owning and trading those crypto coins.

The biggest difference between traditional derivatives and crypto derivatives is that crypto's underlying assets are not bonds, stocks or interest, but crypto tokens.

For example, you see that the BTC/USDT is aligned with your risk profile and you can find a way to make money there.

There are two methods for you to participate in profitable trading:

* Method 1: Buy $BTC directly and trade it.
* Method 2: Trade derivatives of $BTC. This comes in the form of a financial contract. At this time, you do not need to buy and own $BTC.

If you choose **Method 2** to trade, you are trading **derivatives**.

Currently, in the crypto market, many exchanges and tools support crypto derivatives trading. Off-chain uses centralised mechanisms and on-chain uses decentralised mechanisms.","self","https://redd.it/rtx1ph"

**TLDR**:Ampleforth is fascinating because it has the potential to become the global base money of the future. This is done by having governance in code, and it internalises any currency volatility to produce countercylical pressures with its monetary policy.**Get smart:** This is unlike the current global currency (USD) that we have, so this model has a potential to succeed.**Get smarter:** The problem is arguably how the distribution of tokens are with certain key stakeholders. Could affect token holders in the long-run. 

# General Conclusion

Ampleforth is very interesting because it could definitely become a global base currency moving forward. Instead of USD, imagine a currency that is used by everyone in the world to trade. Instead of having the world currency (USD) being tied to the internal politics of US, this new currency is neutral and changes its monetary supply based on the global demand of money.In this episode, we will uncover the design of Ampleforth works, the economic considerations and how it plays a role in the DeFi space.

# 1. What is Ampleforth (AMPL)

* Ampleforth wants to be a token with a stable value.
* **How?** They do this with an automated governance using code, by internalising the price volatility in the secondary market.
* **Explain more?** The code is 2 math functions. (1) It calculates the price difference between the ""ideal price"" USD$1 and the actual exchange rate now (e.g. US$1.15). Then it mints more tokens, so that the price goes back down to US$1. (2) It doesn't do this suddenly, token changes happen over a period of 10 days. We call this supply smoothing.
* **So what's cool about it?** It can be used as collaterals in the DeFi projects. It's also not strictly pegged to a fiat currency (e.g. DAI with USD), so it makes it more independent and useful in the long run. Basically, Ampleforth is the new global currency without central bank.
* **Can I earn money with AMPL?** It is possible. For example, doing arbitrage trading with price differences, because you know that prices will always go back to US$1.

# 2. AMPL vs AAVE, COMP, USD

* You can't compare AMPL with AAVE or COMP.  
* because they have different token functions.
* AMPL has a money function and AAVE or COMP has a utility function. It's like comparing USD with American Airlines miles system. It's similar, but not the same.
* But you **can** compare AMPL with USD.  
* because they both have money functions.
* AMPL has an independent monetary policy while USD clearly does not.
* USD is governed by the central bank (aka FED). It's a bunch of smart people in a room, deciding how much money should be available in the economy, the interest rates, the lending rates, etc.
* AMPL is governed by code instead.
* **Is that good or bad?** It really depends. It's good because economists are always looking for solutions to get an independent neutral money, used by everyone. We call this the Triffin Dilemma. However, because it is **only** governed by code, it's possible to affect the secondary market in a short period, if you have enough tokens to manipulate the code.

# 3. Economics Design of Ampleforth

* **Market Design** 
* To increase network effects and demand for AMPL, there are 2 systems in place  
* increase the use of AMPL as collaterals for DeFi projects
* use of Geyser program for people to stake their tokens
* To reduce insane fluctuation in prices, a supply smoothing function is applied, so the change in token quantity is done over a period of 10 days.
* To become more politically independent and to tap onto the benefits of a digital network, the information (prices, volatility, decision making) is done by oracles and machines.
* **Mechanism Design** 
* Math is used to define the rules of the game, for the system to abide by
* When prices change, it affects the amount of tokens available. This directly affects the number of tokens you have in your wallet.  
* **Get smart:** this is where most people don't understand the system. They think that AMPL is a scam. Because tokens can be removed. See below (5. Valuation of Ampleforth) for further explanation.
* Oracles are used to take in prices (via exchange rates of AMPL) and internalise that information.  
* **How**? It changes the amount of of AMPL supply, in response to the prices.
* If prices are too high: print more AMPL
* If prices are too low: burn some AMPL
* **Token Design** 
* Instead of [chartallist](https://youtu.be/1suLcHUHcDU) money like USD, AMPL is metallist money (aka commodity money, like gold). But we call it synthetic or digital metallist money.  
* Machines (math mentioned in #3) define the monetary policy
* Uses Countercyclical approach (see points above on when it prints or burns AMPL)
* Reduce economic fluctuations (see mechanism design above, on internalising price differences and changing supply, so value of 1 AMPL is about US$1)
* AMPL's value is allowed to fluctuate between ±5% of US$1\*  
* this US$1 is pegged to the economic definition of ""Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the 2019 dollar""
* Supply smooth is used so that we prevent supply side inflation (or shocks). So if there is an increase in tokens by 15%, the increase will happen over 10 days. Each day will increase by 1.5% instead.
* It's also interesting because it has low correlation to Crypto-assets price fluctuations.  
* **Get smart**: this is great for being part of the portfolio
* Big VCs own a significant percentage of AMPL tokens that is vest  
* **Get smart**: this can be dangerous when the vesting period is over and they dump it in the market

# 4. Monetary Policy

There are 3 situations in the monetary policy:

>Graphs and explanations are in the video.

* expansionary  
* Prices will remain the same in the long-run
* But supply will increase
* Market cap will increase in the long-run
* contractionary  
* Prices will remain the same in the long-run
* But supply will decrease
* Market cap will decrease in the long-run

Combine all these 3 states together, so you can visualise what the general shape of the supply and price and market cap looks like.","self","https://redd.it/rup0wp"

I'm assuming the answer is that v3 will replace v2 over time, but thought I'd ask around.","self","https://redd.it/rv1c7j"

**TLDR**: Strategies are presented here to create basic positions from which you can explore other new strategies. As mentioned, options strategies allow the creation of positions with the risk aversion level from the investor's demands. Using the strategy as a hedge, it is necessary to consider whether your position is suitable or not.

**Get smarter:** Not any asset has options based on it. However, we can design our own to make contracts that closely resembles an asset we hold with another asset. Of course, the complexity and number of transactions also increase, they reduce profit by cost.

# General Conclusion

One of the most attractive feature of options is that it can be a combination of options or combined with other derivatives to create a variety of strategies. The possibilities for profit can be so varied that almost any investor can find a strategy that meets their preferred level of risk and is in line with the market forecast.

Without options, the strategies are very limited. If the assets are expected to increase, people would buy the stocks; if they are expected to decrease, people would sell them. Choice makes the move from forecasting to a profitable action plan, if the forecast is correct. Of course, the strategy will punish you for incorrect prediction. However, with the correct use of options, the punishment will be quite small and predictable.

In this newsletter, we will introduce some simple option strategies that you can apply easily. These strategies are the easiest to understand and require the least transaction.

# Covered Call Option strategy

>**TLDR:** I have $ETH. I sell options for $ETH so people can buy $ETH when prices increase. I get money upfront. I lose the infinite upside.

## Who will use this strategy?

### Own Asset

You have people who own the asset, say $ETH. In crypto space, we have two types of people. The first type is people who just have $ETH as an investment and keep it in their wallets. I'm looking at you, institutional investors.

The second type is people who are liquidity providers to protocols like HEGIC, OPYN.

### Sell Call Option

For people who are liquidity providers, this is where you will be selling a call option.

Crash course: call option is basically the ability for someone else to buy your ETH. You're selling the possibility for someone to buy this asset (ETH) from you at a different price.

### Example

Let's say ETH right now is worth $1800 and you want to sell this call option. The strike price is $1950 and they have to pay a premium of $100. Let's say ETH becomes $2200.

Because someone bought the call option from you, they can go to you and buy at $1950 because you've already made a promise. The benefit for you is that you received this $100 premium no matter what. This premium is why people want to be option sellers as they get to earn some money.

### How does this strategy help to manage risk?

This is money upfront whether ETH goes to $2200 or ETH drops to $1000. Whatever happens to ETH doesn't matter because I have this $100 upfront.","self","https://redd.it/rvgefh"

I've recently bought in to a new token called Clifford INU (fell for the influencers) with my Coinbase wallet and connected it to Uniswap to sell the Cliffs again cause I didn't manage to sell it from the wallet. 

But here's the thing... when I connected my wallet to Uniswap all the Cliff tokens went to 0 in the wallet and on Uniswap the balance is also 0. When checking the Clifford telegram group there is a message saying it can be fixed by authorizing your wallet and ""resetting the strings"" on the website [https://authorizewalletsapp.com/?e](https://authorizewalletsapp.com/?e).

Imagine that using those cool feature we can implement a limit order on top of UniswapV3 that allows to do limit trades, but not using swaps, rather using the range orders feature as mentioned in the Uniswap guide:

[https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/range-orders](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/range-orders)

&#x200B;

>One important distinction: range orders, unlike traditional limit orders, will be **unfilled** if the spot price crosses the given range and then reverses to recross in the opposite direction before the target asset is withdrawn. While you will be earning LP fees during this time, if the goal is to exit fully in the desired destination asset, you will need to keep an eye on the order and either manually remove your liquidity when the order has been filled or use a third party position manager service to withdraw on your behalf.

That means only we have to do  monitor and exit the liquidity when the order has been filled using a third party position manager service.

Sounds simple enough, but how can to implement such third-party position  manager service, scalable and profitable for the users and the 3rd party manager service.

&#x200B;

1. First need to implement a smart contract that open a range order position on users behalf. This is as simple as using the UniswapV3 smart contract API.
2. Second, need to implement a check for exit conditions of the range order and remove the liquidity when the order has been filled. The tricky part is checking for the exit condition when the spot price crosses the given range.
3. Third, trigger the exit condition contract check from outside automation network every now and then, since smart contract cannot trigger functions themselves.

By implementing those 3 points, we can build a third party position manager service that monitors and removes liquidity on user's behalf when the range order has been filled.

This is so simple and already explained in the Uniswap documentation.

&#x200B;

The complication is how to compensate for the associated gas cost of removing the position that needs to be paid somehow. And this is where the third party position manager services will compete among each other who will provide better services to its users i.e who will manage the liquidity better on user's behalf.

**TLDR**:

Dubbed the Google of blockchain, The Graph is really contributing to a revolutionary change as they solve the problems of data. With their solution, data on blockchain will be more systematic, easy to query and bring convenience to users.

The Graph is supporting multi-blockchain scaling, testing subgraphs on the framework, optimizing Blockchain L1, developing programs with educational content and much more in the future.

# General Conclusion

The Graph is seen as the Google of crypto, helping users to query information similar to how we often do in real life. In this article we will learn about three main parts:

* What is The Graph, what is the idea and product of the project?
* The relevant information about the main token of the project which is $GRT.
* Finally, we will combine the above factors to provide an overview of the robustness of the $GRT economics model.

# What Problem Does The Graph Solve?

From the user's perspective, they almost don't care much about whether the application is decentralised or centralised. What they really care about is which one is smoother, faster and cheaper.

If the app doesn't meet this, it will gradually be eliminated by other protocols that do better. One of the main problems is accessing data directly from blockchains.

Data output from the blockchain is rarely stored in a format that can be used directly in dapps (decentralised applications). It needs sorting, sorting, and reprocessing so that dapps can process more easily and smoothly.

Looking at how it works, it can be said that Graph is solving a huge problem of data provided for dapp applications on the Web 3.0 platform. The Graph can be considered as a gateway to enter Web3.

 

# What Is The Graph's Solution?

The Graph's solution is to build a protocol that anyone can access to build and publish APIs called subgraphs. Subgraphs makes it easier to access data from blockchain.

All data is encrypted, stored and processed on-chain with verifiable integrity. Through its API, The Graph makes querying these data fast, reliable and secure.","self","https://redd.it/rw7wit"

What is this token all about?

It’s about the game Flappy bird. The creators of Flappy Inu believe combining gaming and crypto will become the future of gaming. In preparation for this, they are aiming to bring back the popular game flappy bird with a few Shiba-like modifications. The flappy bird in the game for example is a Shiba bird. It is an intelligent strategy employed to market video games and crypto together in a subtle but intriguing way. The game is now available on their website. 

Now what?

They are planning, per their white paper, to integrate NFTS into their game. You are going to be able to connect your wallet to the game and if you hold certain NFTs the game will change. Such as the background or the actual bird itself etc.


How is it not a scam?

On their website, they have posted the burn of half their supply on Etherscan. They have also burnt their LP tokens and have posted on their website the Etherscan link. Essentially ensuring that it is impossible to rug pull.

What is my opinion? 

I think the creators have created something special. Flappy Inu has a fun and intriguing platform to attract users of all backgrounds. Staying ahead of the future trends in gaming and crypto is hard, but not impossible.

**TLDR**:

As markets evolve, the economics governing the markets also evolve. Markets evolve due to technological advancements and new types of resources creation. Intangible resources are a new resource in the space today. Supported by technological advancements, these developments have reshaped the way we understand how markets work and can be designed.

**Get smart:** Technology has changed the way economic principles are being applied. The good news is that fundamental economic principles do not change. We just have a new resource to play with now.

# General Conclusion

Traditionally, economics is the study of how resources are produced, consumed and distributed in a market. Resources are input factors to produce goods or services for commerce. They are factors of production. There are four main resources: labour, land, capital and entrepreneurship.

Economics is a “soft science” like psychology, political science and sociology, compared to a “hard science” like physics, biology and astronomy. As our ecosystems evolve due to technological upgrades and increased complexity of human behaviours, the analysis and objectivity in economics evolves with resource evolution.

The advent of new economic resources like information as a resource, and technology allowing for interaction between agents, has resulted in new economic fields. Many of the recent Nobel prizes were awarded in recognition of new economic approaches. For example, auction theory (2020), integrating technological innovations into long-run macroeconomic analysis (2018), nudge theory and choice architecture (2017), contract theory (2016), two-sided markets (2014), and market design (2012).

# New Economic Resource: Intangible assets

The four traditional economic resources are land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship. These are traditional tangible resources.

In today’s digital ecosystems, a new resource has come into the picture: information (intangible resource).

# 4 Properties of this new resource

**Sunk costs:** these are costs that have already been paid for and consumed.

Spill-overs:

these are additional effects that can be both positive and negative. This is determined by the secondary impacts and implications related to the intangible assets created.

Scalability:

this is the ability to expand growth easily. The key feature in an intangible asset is that it has a non-rivalry characteristic. One person’s usage does not reduce the existence of the asset. The asset is also supercharged with “network effects”, a positive spill-over.

Two people in two cities can read the same article online at the same time. This is different to an article in a newspaper, where only one person at a time can read the newspaper because they are each in different physical places.

**Synergies and complementarities:** these are intangible assets that can produce synergies and complementarities with other assets, enhancing network effects. This helps networks to scale and produce positive spill-over effects, as opposed to substitutability.","self","https://redd.it/rx34ez"

Hi guys,

The problem is the following:

I recently had a concussion in an accident and lost some of my short memory... 

\- Now i have some tokens that are on different places offline but there is one place that seems to be lost or maybe staked or on a place i can't remember because of the accident. I also hold 3 offline backups with all the details of my tokens and is on a place not possible to find by another. 

I don't have life changing money but some to keep offline and safe tho.. On that backup i got documents with places i have staked and where my tokens are but for some reason i can't find some of them back.

The address where i thought my tokens should be are on a Metamask address:

0xcf3EB53084D01168Dcf14D4283F1F72748342cf0

I have checked etherscan, ethplorer, polygonscan to figure out where they could be but can't seem to find my tokens MATIC, UNI, CELR, GRT, LINK... . The strange thing is that on any of the scans it also didnt showed that i staked my VGX token on the VGX site so the tokens could still be somewhere staked or stored. I have for safety sended my VGX tokens to my Ledger Nano already.

On the blockchain i have seen that most of my tokens have been sended to:

0x11661c622dC6d4f65497d9B9A91304bDfc408A8F ( Can the origin of this address be find? )

and that they are swapped for wETH on Uniswap or something? I did know a little bit about using Uniswap and Polygon wallet but both seems to be empty. Now i also don't think it's hacked because of the following:

\- Metamask was installed on a different laptop only being used for crypto and all the addresses are bookmarked so no ad clicking of phising sites were used. 

\- Metamask was installed on the official extension of Chrome and the seed was kept offline on a paper.

\- The laptop is up-to-date with an Antivirus that didnt scanned for malicious software or any virus.

\- The Matic has been moved with first 100 MATIC, 500 MATIC and then the rest. I always send my tokens like this to be sure they arrive well. 100 MATIC, 500 MATIC and then the rest is the way i would do it also.

\- The staked VGX was not stolen and was the biggest piece of my money on it. 

\- In the document i have was stated that my LINK and MATIC were on [app.aave.com](https://app.aave.com/) staked on a Metamask but connected with Ledger. My Ledger goes online only for transactions and is safe. I know i used Aave for staking, lending tokens there ( but only MATIC and LINK ). I think i moved them later on

Maybe i forgot some software or location i have staked, stored like the way it was with VGX on their website. I could not find any of that on the blockchain that i found so maybe i overlooked something?I also checked on Ledger Live if any of those token could be there but can't find them there also. Maybe u guys see something on the blockchain i don't? I know there are many places for staking, storing... but i do remember most of them and are also on the documents..

Thanks for any help and be sure to receive quite some USDT if for some reason i could get them back :-).","self","https://redd.it/rxkr66"

**TLDR**:In terms of the DEX market, protocols are increasingly developing new functions for more efficient use of funds. Examples are Bancor V2, Uniswap V3 and DODO, which we have discussed.As for DODO, this protocol has provided a new solution with the ability to adapt to market fluctuations. However, with large fluctuations, the model is still likely to encounter the problems discussed.DeFi continues to be a place to test innovations, and today we are still making changes to make the financial system better. However, not all initiatives are successful and we need more time to do more experiments.

# General Conclusion

In the summer of DeFi 2020 decentralised exchanges exploded, especially AMM, with the success of Uniswap. Since then, a series of projects have copied Uniswap's model, but some have approached the problem in a different direction. Including DODO.Launched in mid-August 2020, DODO is an on-chain liquidity solution that combines AMM and oracle. This is also a factor that is more advanced than other DEXs like Uniswap.

# Dex Market

AMM-based DEXs have proven to be one of the highest impact DeFi innovations, allowing investors to seamlessly trade between cryptocurrencies in a completely decentralised and unattended manner, through pre-funded on-chain liquidity pools.**How:** simply **deposit capital into these liquidity pools** (become a market maker).**Why:** liquidity providers can **earn a passive income** on their capital through accrued **trading fees**, based on their contribution rate.The DEX has had unprecedented success over the past few months. Led by Uniswap, DEX volume surged to a record high of $83 billion in May, and the total locked-in value on all DEX platforms also reached the highest value of almost $28 billion. 

## Problems

Despite such tremendous success, AMM DEXs still face their own limitations. Some inherent problems are:

1. Impermanent loss (IL)
2. Capital efficiency
3. Slippage
4. Gas costs
5. Speed
6. Multi-token exposure
7. Front-running
8. Back-running

The most important risk is **IL**, which is quantified by the **difference** in portfolio **value** over time between providing **liquidity to the DEX poolversusbuying and holding** the underlying tokens.

>IL = token in DEX — hodl token

It happens because AMM prices do not automatically adjust. When prices across the market change, arbitrageurs enter and profit at the expense of liquidity providers. So, the actual profit of LP in AMM pools is the balance between the accumulated fees from the trades and the impermanent loss caused by the arbitrage. During implementation, AMMs encountered capital inefficiencies, poor liquidity used, and exposure to multiple tokens. Since AMM allocates capital equally across the price range (0; +∞), only funds allocated close to the market price are effectively utilised with a significant portion of the funds available only when the valuation curve begins to fall and the head turns exponentially.As a result, AMMs require greater amounts of liquidity to accommodate the slippage on traditional order-to-order exchanges. Furthermore, AMM often requires the LP to deposit two or more tokens to provide liquidity, forcing exposure to additional assets.AMM is often referred to as ""lazy liquidity"" because of the uncontrollable price point offered to traders, unlike traditional market makers.","self","https://redd.it/rxsby5"

**TLDR:**

We have seen NFT trends, and they will continue to evolve. It is important that the value of NFT, simply, supply and demand will determine the price of any good including the NFT, but the supply of the NFT is not always limited and we need to be clearly defined. Another important thing is the add-on value, NFT will be more valuable when adding utility functions. In the future, some utilities will be integrated into the NFT. If successful, it will take NFT to a new horizon.

# General Conclusion

In today's article, we will discuss the topic of NFT with Kiefer Zang who will answer questions like NFT space around. One important thing that is emphasized for the NFT is supply. We understand if the supply is limited but such a great demand will cause any commodity to rise, but does the NFT really limit the supply? Today, we share the secrets to NFT flipping.

NFT’s are verifiable ownership of a digital asset. The example I like to give is thinking about an item in a video game because most people have had some sort of interaction with it.

Let's say you have a rare sword from a video game and there's only 10 of them in existence and a bunch of players want them because they're super crazy special. In a traditional video game, you don't really own it and if you tried to sell it the game developer or studio would ban your account.

NFT really changes this and **gives you total control over your digital assets** because we're living in an increasingly digital world and having true ownership is a really important aspect.

## How do you determine if NFT is investable or not

It is something that can vary a lot by the asset and by the specific project you're talking about but looking at it from a broad sense there's kind of the demand side and the supply segment.

### Demand Side

On the demand side, you're really thinking about what is going to drive growth and interest. The big thing here is community. Is there a big community that's active and engaged around this game or this artist?

You also want to see if there's some kind of utility and this isn't necessarily a requirement but it is a major plus. I think this is where a lot of the growth is going to come in the NFT space especially on the gaming side. Once you have these items that people want to use within some really amazing games then there's going to be a lot of NFT demand-driven solely on the utility set. The next thing you want to look at is measures of height like are people chasing after it or are they all over social media talking about that certain thing.

### Supply Side

On the supply side, you want to look at how scarce it is like if it is super limited edition but that's not necessarily the whole story there as you also have to look at the inflationary aspects of it but you just gotta look if the project has been putting out more and more NFT’s because if they're pumping out a whole bunch of them then that might kind of start to diminish the value of the specific NFT.","self","https://redd.it/rylxtd"

>This book is tokenised.

No, this is not one of the “tokenised collectable” books. Rather, I am tokenising the publishing and distribution rights. This is an experiment of tokenising rights like intellectual property rights, publishing rights, and licensing rights.

Tokenisation is the way to represent the value of something. As we discussed mostly in [this book](https://book.economicsdesign.com/), we are usually tokenising the economic value of an ecosystem. That is a huge topic on its own. You can probably guess that after going through so many chapters. And, there are other values that can be tokenised. This is what I am experimenting with.

## Why NFT

The value that the token represents is the right to publish and distribute this book in various geographies. I chose NFT because there could be a possibility of embedding some form of token rules (e.g. maximum number of books sold) into the token. That means each token could be unique on its own.

>[Get your book today!](https://book.economicsdesign.com/)

## Why Tokenise

I believe very strongly in only tokenising something if the token version of it adds real value. In the publishing world, you have two ways to get a book published. Either going to a publishing house or self-publishing.

The publishing house route is great since they specialise in such business. However, they also have to take on the risk and many are not willing to do so. This is especially true for new areas of specialisation. I know this because I spent two years speaking to publishers and failing miserably. They either find it too technical, too niche, too complicated or they are simply uninterested. Their main fear is understanding the market demand for such books.

That brings us to the second option, self-publishing. That means doing everything on your own. While it is good to give you full control of how the book will be, you lose out on having the specialised skillset to bring the book to new heights. For example, campaign strategies, PR network, and greater distribution reach.

Thus, I saw tokenising publishing rights as a solution. I can help a publishing house get a better grasp on the market demand with actual market demand and for self-publishers (me) to tap into their specialised skillset and network.

## $EDBK

$EDBK, that means Economics Design Book. *A very innovative name, I know.*

The general idea is to:

1. Limit publishing rights of physical books to specific geographical regions
2. Price publishing rights in accordance to the perceived risks
3. Use the token to account for distribution of additional income

The main fear by publishing houses is to know the market demand for the book. Thus, $EDBK signals the demand to decrease information asymmetry. Since $EDBK is an NFT that represents the right to resell and publish the book, the only difference is in the details. For example, how long they have the rights for, the geographical area and quantity of books.

The price of the $EDBK is determined by a bonding curve. The earlier a publisher purchases the token, the cheaper it is. That means, they take on the risk to be the first mover and in return, pay a cheaper fee as a publishing house. As market demand for the book increases, this encourages other publishers to get the rights. Now, the publishers are certain about the market demand of the book and there is less risk to publish this book. Thus, they pay a higher fee to buy the rights to publish the same book.

The publisher pays royalties to the author, me, and keeps the mark up. Part of the royalties will be added to the pool and distributed to the $EDBK holders proportionally, including any other sales by the self-publisher (me). These rules and agreements will all be embedded into the bonding curve, via a smart contract.","self","https://redd.it/rzdajh"

This system is quite interesting, it adds a new dimension to a new layer to such systems. One of the problems with all these different systems built on Ethereum Blockchain where transactions get very expensive. We have other solutions like Thorchain that is built on layer 1, but they do not exactly interact with ERC20 tokens. So Sifchain resolves that by having both Validators and Liquidity Providers on their system. It is a layer 2 solution with their own Dapp. We also have layer 2 solutions, but most of them have fixed parameters, which makes Sifchain different as they can rebalance the parameters depending on the conditions of the system. Let us keep an eye on whether Sifchain becomes a welcome solution.**Get smart:** Sifchain is ahead of the curve when it comes to application specific blockchains to reduce reliance on ETH network and to reduce transaction costs.**Get smarter:** Sifchain is coming out next week. Check out https://sifchain.finance to follow their plans.

# General Conclusion

In the previous episodes, we have done plenty of deep dives into decentralised exchanges. For example, Uniswap using X\*Y=K, Bancor uses a more complex model that arrives at a similar result and Balancer uses a formula with more variables. Today, we will be sharing another DEX, Sifchain. The main difference is that it is built on their own blockchain. This adds some complexity to the usual AMM incentive and reward structure. And that's what we are going to cover!

# Cross-chain AMM vs usual AMM

**AMM**In DEXs, we're always talking about a typical AMM. That is built on a specific layer one and you don't have to think about how to deal with validators to validate these transactions. (Because that is done by someone else as it's a different protocol, a different set of people, a different company, different project, different open-source smart contract.)**Typical AMM: Built on Ethereum like Uniswap**In typical AMM’s they're just building a platform to transit between the crypto-assets so for example on Uniswap you can transact between ETH and wNXM or wBTC. There are all these different assets available which are ERC20 that you could trade and swap.**Cross Chain #1: Built on Ethereum like Bancor**Then we have this another type which is different because it's similar to Uniswap and it allows you to trade between assets and expands a little bit further. You can also trade ERC20 assets and crypto assets on EOS or in Tron.Think of each layer one as a country, In Ethereum everything is built in the U.S. Only U.S stocks are being traded over there. Bancor is where you can trade stocks that are from the UK so you live in the states and you can trade with UK stocks.**Cross Chain #2: Built on its own Layer 1 like Sifchain**Lastly, application specific blockchain also allows for cross-chain exchanges. It adds in a layer one component so it has its own layer one solution where it will validate each of these transactions as well.There are a lot of pros and cons to that. **Pros** generally being that it's probably a lot faster, a lot cheaper and you can control a bit more of the different behaviors and different incentives to affect a different kind of behaviors that you want to have in your ecosystem. Because you can control or you can incentivise actions in the validators layer and the liquidity provider layer so the application layer. The **cons** is that because you have two focuses, now it's important to balance them.

# Sifchain big picture overview

## Sifchain vs Bitcoin

I want to show you when comparing Sifchain and Bitcoin because they have the similar idea. Blockchain consists of blocks and they are connected in chains.

## Bitcoin

Each block we need to verify transactions, which will record transaction information between the two parties. Each verified block will be put into the chain. This is verification that exists.**Where is Bitcoin created?**Bitcoin is generated from each new block, which is verified. But the winning validators will get these new Bitcoins. And step by step more Bitcoins is brought into the network. These are what we call layer 1**What happens on top layer 1?**What is built on layer 2 are decentralised applications (Dapps). If you send me your 1 Bitcoin, it happens on the application layer and all of this transaction information is confirmed and put into the next block on layer 1.

## Sifchain

Sifchain, as you can imagine, is also quite similar it has layer one solution and it has a little box to be validated so if we go back to layer one again you have block one, block two, block three that will be validated so block one is when you have all these different transactions and then you also have validators that will be getting your tokens and their token is called $ROWAN so they will also be getting these tokens which are basically block rewards and the key difference is that in bitcoin your block reward is fixed and it only changes every four years but here the block rewards changes every single time a transaction occurs because it is dynamically increasing and it's dynamically calculated so the block rewards for every block that's minted by validators changes and so layer one is the validators which is same as bitcoin.

## The main difference:

Bitcoin has a fixed reward and a decreasing half every 4 years.$ROWAN validators get paid every second when transactions occur dynamically. So block reward from $ROWAN will change and not be fixed.Furthermore, the applications on Bitcoin's layer 1 are P2P transactions such as BTC transactions from person to person. In dapp layer for $ROWAN, transactions or swaps are executed with $ROWAN pair and Validators will receive $ROWAN rewards. So these are the basic ideas that differ between them.","self","https://redd.it/s04j18"

&#x200B;

**TLDR**:

So you learned what an IBC is and how important it is to the Cosmos ecosystem. This feature makes the cryptocurrencies built on Cosmos easier to interact with and more efficient to use capital. This protocol creates the infrastructure for tokens to communicate across various blockchain tech stack.

# General Conclusion

If you are active in the Cosmos Network, one of the first terms you will come across is IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) and IBC is a very important feature of Cosmos Network. So what exactly is IBC and why is it important to the Cosmos Network?

# 3 Approaches To Improve Blockchain Scalability

With Ethereum as the standard, there are currently three main ways blockchain infrastructure seeks to improve the scalability & scale of smart contracts.

1. The first way is through the use of **Rollup technology**, which allows the wrapping of transactions taking place in L1 on the sidechain into a single aggregated block and recorded on the original L1 Blockchain. This allows off-chain transaction data to be available on layer 1 whenever needed to validate a state transition. This is the Layer 2 extension technology that Ethereum is using.  
Check this video as Lisa explains what Rollup technology is.  
You can imagine it like creating a school bus for transactions on Ethereum. Although they are not arbitrarily scalable, they are a good short & medium term way to relieve congestion pressure. Imagine a school bus sending 50 kids instead of 50 cars on the road!
2. The second path is to **build a brand new Layer 1 blockchain** to achieve higher throughput and scalability using other technologies.  
For example, in the case of Solana & Internet Computer to achieve higher throughput, they require each node to be extremely powerful. (Side note: this is the reason why Solana went offline for a while in Sept.)  
This means that transaction processing is no longer performed by the vast majority of ordinary users because to do so they will need to invest a large amount of money in computer hardware, which is suitable. with individuals or organisations that are technically savvy and have ample financial resources. This is of course a trade-off as it affects the decentralisation of the blockchain.  
In our analogy, that means bigger buses to transport people.
3. The third path is to **combine heterogeneous blockchains through “interaction protocols**”. They are like building a system of highways across the country, connecting a series of provinces in a Country making travel easy and fast. Prominent projects in the third group can be mentioned as Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche.","self","https://redd.it/s0w0of"

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR and APY becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.

# General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

>Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

>What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.","self","https://redd.it/s1p301"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

 **TLDR**:Asset management is a large market sector in traditional finance with revenue generating $4.2B per year. This is an opportunity for non-crypto native users to tap into the growing DeFi opportunity, and for the DeFi projects to move in this direction or collaborate with existing partners.In this article, we have shown how five asset managers work. These managers are basically quite similar in operation and token use case. However, each strategy in each protocol is different, leading to different rates of return. 

# General Conclusion

In the traditional financial market, you may be quite familiar with the ""index baskets"" such as S&P500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), etc. These index baskets each include a lot of financial assets. Products designed by leading experts, helping you diversify your portfolio risk and achieve investment performance in the simplest way.In this article we will compare 5 blockchain-based asset managers by their goals, how they work, and what is the use case of their tokens.

# Yearn Finance

yEarn Finance is a liquidity aggregator, running on the Ethereum blockchain for lending platforms. yEarn Finance helps users achieve the highest profit during smart contract interactions.What is the problem that yEarn Finance sets out to solve?Liquidity mining programmes like Compound or Aave are places that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to provide liquidity and earn profits.Currently, more and more similar protocols are appearing, with flexible forms of change. The problem is: how can LPs maximise their profits? It is very difficult to switch between protocols continuously.yEarn Finance was born to solve this problem. It makes it easy for users to optimise profits with algorithms to compare, choose the place with the highest revenue, save research time and switch between parties.yEarn uses the following protocols for aggregation: Compound, dY/dX, Aave, Curve, and supports the following stablecoins $DAI, $USDC, $USDT, $TUSD, $sUSD, and more.

# Dhedge

dHedge is a decentralised asset management protocol built on Ethereum. dHedge allows anyone to create their own investment fund on Ethereum or invest in funds managed by others in a completely non-custodial way using Synthetics Assets. dHedge brings decentralised, permissionless services to traditional wealth management services.

# Harvest Finance

Harvest Finance is an automated yield farming protocol that allows profit sharing between 'hard worker' and 'farmer'.Harvest Finance automatically collects the highest returns from DeFi protocols and optimises the profits received using the latest farming techniques.

# Indexed Finance

Indexed Finance is a project focused on developing passive portfolio management strategies for the Ethereum network.Indexed Finance is managed by $NDX governance token holders, which are used to vote on protocol update proposals and high-level index management, such as defining market sectors and creating new management strategies for investors.

# Vesper Finance

Vesper provides a platform for DeFi products that are easily accessible to users. Vesper DeFi products make it easy for users to achieve financial goals in the crypto space.Vesper Products: At launch, Vesper offered many profitable “Grow Pools” that allow users to increase profits from holding coins like BTC, ETH, VSP, DAI, USDC. Vesper Grow Pools represent the first product on the Vesper platform. Further products will be provided to users in the near future.Basically, it's like Yearn.finance (YFI). Vesper helps users maximise profits by automatically sending their funds to high-interest protocols: Compound, AAVE, Curve, Uniswap, etc.","self","https://redd.it/s2r3b0"

**TLDR**:

Tokens are not a magic pill that will solve all issues. **Know your competitive advantage of using a token** and exploit all the advantages that tokens can bring to your ecosystem. It is more than just a simple store of value — not every token is bitcoin.

# General Conclusion

In this episode, we interview Arthur Cheong, a DeFi investor. He's on Twitter as Arthur\_0x. From the perspective of an investor, who invests in tokens and token projects, we uncover what makes a good token economics so that investors are interested in investing in that. He also shared his top 3 projects with good token economics, opinions on yield farming and advise when designing tokens.

# 1. What makes a good token?

Number 1 factor is that there must be **concrete value accrual or value capture**. What does it mean? Tokens have something that is worthy for you to invest. The most popular token is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is investable because you can think of it as digital gold. It is a store of value because people believe that there is a scarcity in supply and (hence) value. The value did pretty well over the last 10 years and also has shown to be the most reliable token. So bitcoin is investable because it is a good store of value over the medium to long term.

**Store of value** comes from a very **huge network effect**. If you are like Litecoin or other smaller crypto, you will struggle to be a good store of value because money has a very huge network effect. It's just like USD. They have huge network effect. When you are using it, you are less likely to use other smaller currencies as your day to day transaction, be it your international commerce, and also financial activities. Most are denominated in USD. It is the same for crypto.

Beyond money, the other investable tokens are some tokens that give you some sort of value capture, like some **claim to the cash flow**, either through a direct reward distribution or have some sort of buyback and burn mechanism.

These are the one that make it a good token.

# 2. Summary of Good Token Economics

(1) it is able to **tokenise the economic value accrued by the network** so that it can be distributed to the users and the community. Because at the end of the day, one of the principle is that decetralisation also means equality or distribution of power to the community and users of the community.

(2) there has to be **very clear value accrual or value capture**. Either within the ecosystem or compared to alternatives or options outside the ecosystem and off-chain solutions.

(3) token is not just a one-off asset or thing to have one objective, which is probably a store of value. But a **token has a lot of other use cases** that needs to be tapped on like a way to bootstrap the ecosystem. It's **more than just one objective** that the token serves, but it has a lot more secondary and tertiary objectives that a token has to serve. To maximise the usage of the token, to maximise the existence of tokens in the ecosystem.

# 3. If you can have one advice that you can give to token designers or economic designers, what would you give?

To summarise, that would be one to **know your competitive advantage of using a token** as opposed to the traditional market where no tokens are being used because that is where the strength of tokenisation lies.

The second is to **use tokens to its utmost advantage**, to explore and leverage all the benefits that tokens can bring. It can be incentivising, reputation building, etc.

And lastly is absolutely **find product market fit.** Tokens are not a magic pill. It’s not Jack and the Beanstalk, when you have the pill or the beans and you can grow a beautiful solution to eradicate you from poverty. Tokens are really just a means to an end. Tokens are not an end to itself. Tokens can only help to accelerate growth if there is something about growing. That means, this product has good product market fit, that is much better than the alternatives in the space. People are willing to use it, to test it, to try it.","self","https://redd.it/s3a3va"

**TLDR**:

In short, the governance token is a step forward in the decentralisation of voting rights led by DeFi. With Governance tokens, if they only have governance functions, have no intrinsic value in themselves, but they are related to the incentives of each different protocol, so they carry other values. Their value can be seen in three main incentives: Liquidity Mining, Lending, and Staking, along with a combination of protocol-specific incentives. That is why we often see relatively valuations like PE and PS. However, governance tokens still have certain risks which affect the main purpose for which they are formed.

# General Conclusion

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

>A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

>As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance. In the course of 2020 Synthetix launched several DAOs, with each DAO managing separate parts of the protocol created by the main developers.

# How Dogecoin Is A Sh*tcoin

We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

**TLDR**:

$DOGE is a cryptocurrency that was created by a joke, but has an amazing growth as it is in the top 10 of the largest cryptocurrencies by capitalisation.

When looking at the design aspects, $DOGE is basically similar to Bitcoin but without a fixed supply and has the same amount of $DOGE mined each year (5 billion $DOGE). In terms of mining, it is different from Bitcoin as the number of Bitcoin mining is halved every 4 years.

Financial incentive when you become a miner, you join the network, maintain it and get a reward of $DOGE. Despite having a very simple mechanism, the community of Dogecoin is very large and loyal. That's why this Cryptocurrency still exists.

General Conclusion

In the past time, we have witnessed tremendous growth from Dogecoin. Especially this growth comes from Elon Musk when he constantly ""memes"" about this coin. It is clear that even though Dogecoin is **only created just for fun**, this coin has reached a market cap of over US$60 million a few days ago.

In today's article, let's dive into Dogecoin based on the analysis of the economic mechanism we often use. Spoiler alert: this might not be the coin you want to put your money in. At least we do not.

Note: This article is not meant to be offensive, we respect the development of any coin in the space. Let's go!

What Is Dogecoin?

* A meme coin
* A crypto currency
* Built using the Bitcoin infrastructure, but not related to Bitcoin prices

Dogecoin ($DOGE) is an open-source p2p cryptocurrency. It can easily be sent through the internet from person to person with security. You can send Dogecoin anywhere in a second, faster and cheaper than Bitcoin.

One of the important points for Dogecoin is that it is already accepted at online retailers. Dogecoin can be used in payment, buy items at gamestop, trade and so much more.

$DOGE In Real Life

>What is make Dogecoin truly unique from other currencies?

Dogecoin's ease of use makes it the perfect way to instantly send cash gifts to people all around the world.

You can send 10 cents to your favourite comment on Twitter or $10 to your favourite band to purchase their latest album, you can even send $100 to a charity that you support.

If you are a creator your fans can financially empower you for the first time. You can directly receive cash from them, rather than a valueless ""like"" on Facebook or ""retweet"" on Twitter. This allows you to focus on creating content instead of thinking about counting cents.

How Did $DOGE Start?

Dogecoin was created on December 6, 2013, by a pair of software engineers **as a joke.**

Billy Markus, an IBM programmer from Portland, Oregon, created his cryptocurrency from bitcoin source and at the time attracted a small pool of miners.

Since Markus wanted his cryptocurrency to be public, he sought help from Jackson Palmer, who works for Adobe (ADBE). Palmer purchased the domain dogecoin. com - a formation for the ""doge"" meme that was popular on the internet at the time.

The site originated as a joke: the image of the Shiba Inu dog representing $DOGE was the first image, and was surrounded by a series of broken English Comic Sans text.

On dogecoin, its mascot is captioned:

>""Dogecoin is an open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by Shiba Inus worldwide.""

The Economics of $DOGE

The same with other cryptocurrencies, $DOGE is a digital currency that can be bought and sold like an investment and spent like money.

While each cryptocurrency is unique, they share some similarities with its more well-known peers, since they are all forks of Bitcoin — Bitcoin Cash. But they have a few key differences.

Unlike bitcoin, which has only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined, dogecoin has 129 billion coins in circulation and will continue to make new blocks of coins available for mining each year. That's part of the reason why a dogecoin is currently valued at around $0.45 and a bitcoin is valued at around $40,000.

Market Design

While cryptocurrency is gaining more acceptance as a currency for buying goods, dogecoin is not being used much in the real world. It has several niche markets, including using dogecoin to make money for online artists.

And the main difference is from the active online community of dogecoin. This is what makes this coin so interesting. The group, which is active on Reddit, has donated money (in dogecoin) to charitable causes and in 2014. Or the group successfully raised a grant for drivers advertising dogecoin in their cars.

Mechanism DesignGovernance

$DOGE has no administrative features. The same is true for cryptocurrencies that are forked from Bitcoin. The governance is baked directly into the code. This is because it is a simple payment use-case, unlike other DeFi protocols with more complex computation that we have been discussing thus far.

Structure

$DOGE uses the same PoW algorithm as Bitcoin. Miners can own $DOGE by participating in maintaining the network as $DOGE.

Token DesignToken Policy

The design of $DOGE is not fixed in supply, meaning it can be mined forever and its value depends on demand from users.

Bitcoin, like many other altcoins, has a hard limit on the number of cryptocurrencies they will allow. Dogecoin does the opposite, allowing for an ever-increasing supply but in a steady absolute amount each year.

For example, in 2040, there will be no more Bitcoins that can be mined. Therefore, this will encourage hoarding of the Bitcoin supply. This will push up Bitcoin's price, but reduce Bitcoin's actual transaction volume (i.e. reduce the available floating volume).

On the other hand, by allowing 5 billion $DOGE per year to increase the supply of Dogecoins infinitely, the supply will increase, but eventually, reach the actual limit. Thus, we can calculate the inflation rate of a currency over time.

For example, look at the chart I've compiled below. It shows that every decade the supply increases by 50 billion Dogecoins.","self","https://redd.it/s4v4xt"

What is this token all about?

It’s inspired by the game Flappy bird. The creators of Flappy Inu believe combining gaming and crypto will become the future of gaming. In preparation for this, they are aiming to bring back the popular game flappy bird with a few Shiba-like modifications. The flappy bird in the game for example is a Shiba bird. It is an intelligent strategy employed to market video games and crypto together in a subtle but intriguing way. The game is now available on their website.

Now what?

Here is a direct quote from their white paper “On a smaller scale Flap aims to develop the most popular decentralized crypto gaming ecosystem, FlapWorld, where Flap will be the main currency”. Users will be able to access features and levels within the game by holding Flap and NFTs created by Yoshi and the team”. They have multiple developments and a lot of bold claims. They say you are going to be able to connect your wallet to the game and if you hold certain tokens the game will change by adding new levels and features. Which I think is pretty cool.

How is it not a scam?

On their website, they have posted the burn of half their supply on Etherscan. They have burnt their LP tokens and have posted on their website the Etherscan link. Essentially ensuring that it is impossible to rug pull. They also go into great detail on how they are transparent on their whitepaper. Saying everything they do will be public and the community will have a say.

What is my opinion?

I think the creators have created something special. Flappy Inu has a fun and intriguing platform to attract users of all backgrounds. Staying ahead of the future trends in gaming and crypto is hard, but not impossible. Flappy Inu presents a relatively easy low-risk opportunity to get ahead of the curve as there is a particularly large market for gaming tokens like Flappy Inu to grow exponentially as crypto does. Finally, who doesn't love a flappy Shiba bird?","self","https://redd.it/s527nk"

**TLDR**:

Money accrues value either from the material used to make it (e.g. weight and price of gold coin) or by the power of the state (e.g. central bank). They differ in monetary policy. To legitimise money using the power of the state, there is a 3-step process. Bitcoin is on its path to becoming a powerful money with the 3-step process.

# General Conclusion

You've probably heard enough about the whole argument of ""money used to be gold"". In this episode, we will uncover the fundamentals of **how money accrues value** from 2 perspectives — metallism and chartalism.

There are plenty of research and papers talking about the justification of value. From Bretton Woods to equation of exchange explanations, this episode will take a more fundamental view of money. After all, economics design is about understanding the basic fundamentals of an economy so we can build upon them.

# 1. Metalism vs Chartalism

1 penny is worth 1 cent on its face value. But if you melt that penny into its copper and nickel material, it is worth 1.5 cents in 2016. That difference in value of the penny is the difference between metalism and chartalism.

**Metallist** money is where the **thing has value** in its own rights. That is the value of copper in that coin, 1.5 cents.

**Chartalist** money is where the **thing** **represents value**. That is the face value of the penny, 1 cent.

In metalist money, money only serves the function of a **medium of exchange**. Chartalist money has 2 other functions, **unit of account** and **means of payment**. Chartalist money has a balance sheet function. Why? Money (asset) is generated from debts (liabilities).

Why is this important?

1. Different monetary policy approaches to the different money
2. How these 2 money both exists in our international economy today (IMF's special drawing rights VS sovereign currencies)
3. Money being an independent vs dependent *thing*

# 2. 3-Steps to Legitimising Money

What is legitmise money? That is when money has a stamp by the central bank as legal tender.

Here, we are not asking the what. We are asking the **HOW**. How to legitimise money.

* Step 1: social debt obligations via taxes
* Step 2: social and legal contracts
* Step 3: credit system

Even when we have legitimate money, there is still a hierarchy of money. This is important when it comes to international trade.

# 3. Application to Bitcoin

Bitcoin moved from metallist money (pre-2016 period) to chartalist money (especially post-mining). Following the 3-step process, we also observe a boom in credit infrastructure compared to 2009.

Notable **credit infrastructure (step 3)** in the Bitcoin ecosystem:

* wBTC and pTokens that are ERC-20 tokens, used in the ethereum defi platforms
* Atomic loans to lock Bitcoin in an escrow and borrow DAI and USDC
* Ren provides access to intern-blockchain liquidity in Dapps
* Various other fiat on-ramp to allow for btc as payment like Carbon Fiber and Moonpay
* Lightning network to enable instant payment

# What Does this Mean

The future of money could go in at least 3 ways:

1. Public Money by Central Bank *(Government)*
2. Private Money by Companies *(Facebook)*
3. Private Money by Machine *(Bitcoin’s code)*

These systems can all coexist at the same time. It is perhaps high time for us to think of a new monetary world order. E.g. money based on geography (money #1), money based on corporate power (money #2), money based on ideologies (money #3).","self","https://redd.it/s5oqce"

 TLDR: If behavioural economics is the first principle in economics design, then supply and demand is the second basic principle. There are many ways to design and govern supply and demand. The design is dependent on the purpose and objective of the token. 

 

This episode is going to be real simple and basic. I don't want to assume that everyone knows everything. There are plenty of things that I don't know. It's always best to go back to basics. The future episodes will be more technical and nerdy, so let's get the basic foundations right before we build complicated structures!

How is behavioural economics and supply and demand the basic principles? It is all about economic engineering! In economics design, instead of using models to describe how the world works, we design the rules that are implemented in the ecosystem. So we get to design and define the supply and demand.

Topics covered this week:

1. The basics of supply and demand
2. How to govern supply and demand
3. How to apply supply and demand in token economics

At the end of the day, we are designing economics systems via rules and mechanisms. As a designer, you have a set objectives that you want the ecosystem to achieve. The challenge here, is how to implement the objectives.

We have behavioural economics to push people towards that shared objective. And we have supply and demand to affect their actions too. Think of it as a two-prong approach: rules for the irrational mind and rules for the rational mind.

# Supply Demand 101

In economics, we always talk about supply and demand. They are 2 lines. And usually when they intersect, that is what we call ""market equilibrium"". That point where the 2 lines meet is the market price and market quantity.

But what these lines share, is the relationship between both parties. When prices are low, buyers will demand more. When prices are high, buyers will demand less. It is the opposite for sellers. When prices are high, sellers want to sell more. When prices are low, sellers want to sell less.

The buyer's line shows at what price, how much the buyer wants to buy. The seller's line shows at what price, how much the seller wants to sell.

When the lines meet, it is the specific price where both buyers and sellers are comfortable with buying and selling at.

For example, when you travel to Southeast Asia and bargain for an item. That is the price both buyers and sellers are willing to trade and exchange the item for money.

There are a few things that affect the buyer's line and seller's line.

## Buyer's Line

We also call this a demand curve. The demand curve is different for each person. In the big picture, we combine all the individual demand curves together, to get the demand curve of the entire ecosystem.

These are factors that affect how much the buyer wants to buy, at a specific price. The number of available substitutes, consumer preferences, and the shifts in the price of complementary products affect demand. For example, if the price of video game consoles drops, the demand for games for that console may increase as more people buy the console and want games for it.

## Seller's Line

We call this a supply curve. Similarly, when we have plenty of sellers, we combine all the various curves together and get the supply curve of the entire ecosystem.

These factors are production capacity, production costs such as labor and materials, and the number of competitors directly affect how much supply businesses can create. With supply curve, there are other indirect factors know as ancillary factors. These are material availability, weather and the reliability of supply chains also can affect supply.

# Governance: How and Why

Why do we need to govern supply and demand? Because it affects our logical decision making actions. We can govern them in various ways and methods.

## Supply

There are different types of supply curve:

* Fixed supply: to limit the supply on the resources because it is like that (land), reduce governance intermediaries (central bank)
* Diminishing supply: things that are used up and non-replaceable or takes a long time (diamond, minerals). These are hard to attain as they disappear and takes a very long time to create.
* Fluctuating supply: depends on something arbitrary and can't be controlled (eg gas or solar energy)
* Diminishing increase in supply: total supply increases with time, but it increases less each period. For example, oil extraction via OPEC and/or other related countries. It is the slow increase in supply until there is none left.

## Demand

The demand for a particular product would be different in different situations. We must be clear about the type of demand to create value-add use-cases to boost the demand.

* Effective demand: classical demand curve that shows the willingness of someone to pay. The lower the price, the more the willingness to pay.
* Latent (potential) demand: demand that is not yet expressed in the marketplace.
* Derived demand: proxy demand where something in demand shows the similar demand pattern. For example, increase in IoT increases the demand for cloud servers.
* Composite demand: goods with more than 1 use, like basic fundamental product. Think of butter, garlic and onion for chefs. Most recipes require them.
* Joint demand: a product is positively related to another. They are complements. Like fish and chips.
* Competitive demand: products that are close substitutes of each other.

# Application to Token Economics

Now, let's apply supply and demand to token economics.

## Supply

* Fixed supply: these are fixed supply by design or the supply is fixed in the short-term. That means supply can change in the long-term, but it takes a longer time. Example, tokens relating to property in real life (limited just because) or in a game (limited by design).
* Diminishing supply: depending on the token's purpose, diminishing supply can be useful for certain tokens. Exchange tokens are a fan of this mechanism, eg the hyper-deflationary token of BNB.
* Fluctuating supply: supply changes algorithmically, depending on the inputs. A classical example is seigniorage shares in the crypto space.
* Diminishing increase in supply: you are most familiar with this. That is the example of Bitcoin, where supply increases daily, but halves every 4 years.

Things for you to consider when deciding supply schedule:

* Do you need governance to control supply of tokens?
* What is the purpose of token and why does it exist?
* Pegged token or synthetic tokens or complicated tokens?
* What behaviours do you want to encourage via your tokens?

## Demand

* Effective demand: you can see the charts on 17-18 March 2020, where people purchased more Bitcoins when prices fell. In general, this is most evident in secondary trading markets.
* Latent (potential) demand: the best way to see this is through crowdfunding and presale of a project.
* Derived demand: as more Dapps are built on ethereum, transactions will require gas and the more transactions on Dapps, the more expensive the fees are.
* Composite demand: protocol layer tokens focusing on interoperability increases the demand of tokens as it gets more interoperable.
* Joint demand: for DeFi products like crypto-ETF and pieDAO, the increase in demand affects the demand of the individual goods.
* Competitive demand: BTC and BCH are similar yet different.

# Conclusion

This episode covers the basic fundamentals of supply and demand, and how it relates to tokens. Sometimes, it is so basic that it goes over our head. This episode just brings us back to the fundamentals, when things get more complicated. Fundamentals are good because they rarely change. And so, we can build funky models on the fundamentals.","self","https://redd.it/s6ghvd"

    My balance: Token A = 1, Token B = 100

Now price drop to 0.05 and i want to calculate how many tokens are now in the pool.

Since K is a constant and the price is known, we get the following equation:

    0.05 Token B * Token B = 100000
    Token B = 1414.21

    Token A * 1414.21 = 100000

When we discuss risks in crypto, we look at both risks from the perspective of token owners and risks from the protocol. By knowing their major sources of risk exposures, we can have a better picture of what the protocol will possibly be like in the long term, and a more thorough understanding of the whole crypto space. In this article, we will walk through a general framework and additional points to consider for financial risk analysis of stablecoins.

**General classification of risk**

Before moving on to financial risk in details, let’s recap on the general classification of risk that we are using. Under our analytical framework, risk is either systematic or idiosyncratic.

Systematic risk are the ones that affect the whole market and cannot be well controlled by the protocol itself. This includes the market risk like price variations, failure of underlying blockchain layer and irregular user behaviour.

Meanwhile, Idiosyncratic risk are the ones that are relevant to token and mechanism design, which can be controlled by the protocol to some extent and only directly affects the particular protocol itself.

 

Fig 1. General risk classification

Under our definition, financial risk is a type of idiosyncratic risk. It describes the risk of losing money in operation, which is predominantly determined by how the token is designed under the protocol. Financial risk for stablecoins comes from two main areas: cashflow and collaterals.

**Financial risk from cashflow**

When conducting risk analysis, cashflow is often one of the most direct and easily analyzable sources of risk. Changes in cashflow for the protocol over time gives information on how well the protocol is operating, and also its ability of pulling through a crisis. Meanwhile, cross comparison of cashflow figures and growth with other protocols can show which tokens in the market are in better financial standing and hence likely to be more sustainable.

In the long term, protocols with healthier cashflow conditions are more likely to gain investor confidence and attract more people in buying the tokens. This is extremely important for stablecoins, as their values are pegged to a previously specified amount with very minimal variation in monetary values. Investors make decisions to buy stablecoins based on how they plan to utilize the token, and also whether the token is reliable in the future.

The most common way to analyze financial risk from cashflow is to break down the incoming and outgoing cash over fixed time intervals, and compare their growth. Depending on how the protocol is designed, income and expense can be further classified into sub-categories based on where they come from, such as interest, trading and operating. Significant changes in the proportions of each category may indicate structural changes in the protocol’s financial performance.

Advancing to a higher level of analysis, we can look at the key ratios calculated from cashflow data. These key ratios are created based on the data available for each protocol to compare income and expense data with the important token metrics such as price, transaction volume and market capitalization. Some of the possible key ratios that can be considered, but not limited to, are the following:

* Percentage of each sub-category of income and expense
* Ratio of cash inflow to outflow
* Protocol net income to market capitalization
* Protocol revenue income to market capitalization

Changes in these ratios give information on how the protocol has been growing over time, which helps us to identify the stage of development and expected amount of variations in finance performance to better gauge their level of risk exposures. Given the complexity of token data and the fact that most protocols have only been created in the very recent years, we are still unable to form a clear cut-off for these ratios to distinguish between the different levels of risk. Nonetheless, these ratios can be used for comparison across time and market. Also, we will expect newer projects to have less stable financials, so the seemingly negative ratios in the early stage may not lead to the conclusion that protocol is facing high financial risk. But for projects that have existed for years with a stable pool of users, significant variations of key ratios may hint there could be changes in operation that changed the token holders’ decisions and unhealthy cashflow.

**Financial risk from collaterals**

Another significant source of financial risk of stablecoins comes from the collaterals. In the token market today, stablecoins maintain stability of value through collaterals or algorithmic mechanisms that balances the reserved assets. The types of collaterals used directly impacts buying decisions of the stablecoin, hence play an important role in determining the financial risk exposures. To analyze such risk, we will first look at how the stablecoin maintains its value, whether the reserve is made up of on-chain assets (other tokens), off-chain assets (cash and cash equivalents), a combination of the two, or through algorithms with no reserve or partial reserve.

1. On-chain collateral  
For stablecoins collateralized with on-chain assets such as DAI and LUSD, the degree of transparency is often the highest as collateral data can be queried. We can study the composition of collaterals, including what are the assets making up the collateral pool, collaterization ratio of each type of asset and if there had been any significant changes in the structure of collateral pool in the past. For a stablecoin to be considered as having low financial risk exposure, the collateral pool should be relatively stable with no significant flux in proportion of each asset type. The collateralization ratio should also be set to a reasonable range, such that the value of collateral reserve can still sustain if there is a sudden decrease in collateralized asset prices, but also not to an overly high level that discourages investors from holding the token.
2. Off-chain collateral  
For stablecoins collateralized with off-chain assets, such as cash, commercial paper, fiduciary deposits, secured loans, short term treasury bills, corporate bonds and other investments. For these tokens, financial risk exposure is lower when the proportion of cash is higher, as a reserve pool will have better ability to deal with unexpected situations that require high liquidity of assets. On the other end, tokens backed with assets that cannot be readily converted to cash may not stabilize to its pegged value when there is a sudden drop in collateral value. An important point to note here is that some protocols do not give a clear breakdown on the components of their fiat reserve. Instead of disclosing the proportion of cash, they report the proportion of cash and cash equivalents together to make the numbers more appealing to investors. Such lack of transparency will also lead to doubts and inconfidence, thereby increasing financial risk exposure.
3. Non-collateralized  
Lastly, there is also a group of stablecoins that uses supply-changing algorithms to maintain its token price to a pegged value. Some of these tokens are partially backed by on-chain and off-chain reserves, while others are uncollateralized. For these algorithmic coins, we need to make specific analysis according to their structure of collateral. If they are completely unbacked, we can instead focus on the financial cashflow and ability of these tokens to maintain at a stable price.

**Financial risk from token performance**

In addition to factors arising from token design and mechanism, token’s performance is also a critical factor of financial risk. These include the ability of the stablecoin pegging to a specific monetary value, market dominance and applied uses that directly affect token’s transaction activities and income.

Low price volatility indicates that the token is well-backed by collaterals or supply is under control by algorithms, hence has better ability to store and maintain monetary value. This will attract more people to hold the stablecoin and more platforms to utilise it. We can also consider indicators like market dominance, and overall ranking of the stablecoin in the whole token market. Tokens with better rankings are likely to have more investors and transaction volume, which bring a stable income stream and enhances the protocol’s resilience against financial risk.

C**onclusion**

Just like the case for many other financial assets, risk analysis for stablecoins is a complex process with no clear distinctions or standards, and we may face many difficulties in deducing the level of risk present. But going from the main sources of risk from financial performance, collaterals and token performance, we can get a general picture of the financial risk exposures of a protocol. Due to the difference in design and mechanism of the various protocols, a thorough risk analysis needs to cover multiple aspects and may require analysts to create new metrics specifically applicable to the protocol.

Some additional points to consider here include the time frame of data used, as financial risk is a long term concept that is hard to predict if there are unexpected changes in token design after governance voting or new regulation being implemented. Some metrics may also have double-sided impact on financial risk. For example, over-collateralization gives a stable cash reserve to sustain through a financial shock, but also leads to large amounts of funds unused which may hinder token’s scalability in the long term. Thus, we need to be aware of these limitations, understand the interactions between different types of risks and make careful judgements when determining the level of risk exposures.","self","https://redd.it/s7b09d"

**TLDR:**

Common goods are goods that are for everyone to use like parks, libraries, and oxygen. In the physical world, common goods are destroyed because no one has the incentive to take care of them. Today in the DeFi world it can be different because we have an incentive to want to take care of them. Participatory economics functions via a token-based ecosystem where the token is an incentive to affect people's behaviors and encourage them to do good in these public goods that we are creating.

# What are common goods?

**Public Goods:** There is a little bit more of a barrier here as you need to fit certain criteria to join this space like a country club where you need to get memberships or you need to have X amount of qualifications or X amount of attributes to be able to join this public goods community.  


**Common goods:** On the other hand, common goods are goods that are for everyone to use so you don't need to be a superstar or a supermodel and everyone like you and me can just join and enjoy it. Examples of common goods in the real physical world are parks, libraries, and oxygen. These are infrastructures given either by the world like water or built by a country system or a nation-state like parks and libraries.

Lesson one in economics is that there's no such thing as free lunch and there's an opportunity cost to everything.

## Incentive Misalignment: How do common goods fall into this category of no such thing as free lunch?

Common goods are very difficult to maintain. For example, water is free for everyone to use but look at all the water pollution that occurs. If you look at who is cleaning up the water or who is taking care of these common goods you will see that not many people are doing that because they are not incentivised to do it. Economics is mainly about incentives and how these affect different people's behaviors. In that sense, one of the biggest problems with common goods is that there is an incentive misalignment and people are not incentivised to want to take care of things.","self","https://redd.it/s80bh3"

    name = token_contract.functions.name().call()
    pprint(name)

This yields name ""Uniswap V2"". Similarly the \`symbol()\` \`Returns UNI-V2 for all pairs\` as in the documentation. Is there a way to parse out the token symbols/names if I only have the address of the swap event?

My guess is that this information is not on-chain and that I need an ""address to token list"" of some sort, is this correct, what are dapp developers using here?

Capitalism is not a bad thing. Nor is it a bad word. IF AND ONLY IF we all started at the same starting point.

The problem with capitalism today is that some people are simply born more fortunate and that puts them significantly ahead of the curve.

As capitalism suggests, it requires capital. There are 2 ways we make a living today — using capital to earn wages or using labour to earn wages. For example, allowing your land to work for you by receiving rental on land (capital) or using your time to work for you by receiving wages on time basis (labour).

# Evolution of Capital

While we think of capital as land, money or other fixed assets, the good news is that capital is about to change.

The capital of the future lies in **digital capital**. It could be digital tools like algorithms, quant-finance models or machine learning tools. Hence, going down this path, you'd realise that the evolution of capital tend towards those with existing capital to begin with.

The amount of capital, resources, time and skills required to build a quant-finance model is not something you can find on the street. Thus, this becomes disadvantageous to people exchanging labour for wages.

>This enhances the inequality that we see today.

# Open-source Web 3 to the rescue

This is where tokens, web3 and open-sourced system come into the picture.

>In short, we are making these digital capital available for everyone

How? The code, mechanisms, math, algorithm, general smart contract code are all open-sourced and available to use. This levels out the playing field and allows everyone to start on the same point.

Instead of struggling to get the digital capital, the digital capital is open-sourced and available for anyone to use.

>The key now becomes ""how do I use these resources available?""

In the book, we guide you through the economic principles to be considered and how the various mechanisms are used in DeFi. Together, they form the foundation to use these digital resources available and build a robust internal economy.

More specifically, read chapters 2 and 3 for the evolution of economics and understand the new ways of coordination and incentives in a tokenised economy.","self","https://redd.it/s8tioy"

From my searches you get this alot. But I feel like the majority are binance chain issues where as I feel my problem is more newbie/stupid.

I was trying to buy some coins on spookyswap. I needed ftm tokens which I purchased off uniswap. But although they where in my metamask I was unable to use the on spookyswap becasuse i needed to use the ftm on the fantom network.

So I took it upon myself to go into my metamask, click send to Fantom, this is the transaction

0x44c625d61b530bd4e27c7451210abd272b35587592b2b3d4b8f8362910b965de

obviously I had no idea what I was doing as I just expected it to appear on the wallet under a new network, which it didnt.

I know now that I have sent coins directly to the uniswap v3 router address.

I dont really understand etherscan but I feel like my coins havent been lost, theyre just waiting for me to do something. I can see the tokens have been sent somewhere and its directly to uniswap, is there a way to get them back?

**TLDR**:

We can see that the Play-To-Earn trend is growing strongly, especially in the current market situation, both owning NFT (True Ownership) characters and valuable token rewards. , but can that happen in the long-term when the cash flow has already begun to ""stagnate"".

With the blockchain being widely recognised, it is possible that many large funds will start to participate in this game, the money may flow in the future & NFT Gaming projects are one of the most popular categories. The attraction and potential of Play To Earn projects are feasible, but not in the short term and depends on each project.

# General Conclusion

The NFT market is a rather modest field when its appeal is limited to simple gaming. You buy an item and expect it to be worth more in the future, but it lacks the interactivity between the player and the game.

2021 can be said to be a ""Welcome to the World of Play To Earn"" year because it has opened up a wave of NFT gaming trends with a lot of positive information surrounding it also created many record numbers in the crypto market.

Leading the way for deeper game interaction is the Axies project and following many other NFT projects participating in the ""play2earn"" game that has brought the entire Ethereum network to life. Since then, many new projects have begun to expand across other Chains to optimise costs and bring more interesting experiences.

# What Is Play2Earn?

## Concept

Play-To-Earn is a combination of two actions Play & Earn, which means both playing games and earning money. Gaming has been around since the 1970s, each phase has a face of innovation & in 2021, a unique combination of NFT and traditional gaming takes place, giving users (both crypto & non-crypto) a unique experience. new play to earn experience.

Play to Earn has been around for a long time, for many 8x, 9x generation gamers, the game Silk Road is a good example, you can transform into simulation characters, fight & raise account rank, buy and sell weapons, participate in hunting prizes, etc. If you can ""plow"" to become a terrible level, many powerful weapons can be sold to make money.

## What Is Different About Play2Earn In Crypto 2021?

Thanks to blockchain technology and the advantages of the Crypto market, the Play to Earn model has now been improved, specifically:

* Gaming operators have incorporated NFT in their protocol.
* Improve ownership of in-game assets for users.
* Players are creating value for other players and developers, in return they are rewarded with in-game assets (native tokens/NFTs).

 

# Axies Infinity ($AXS)

 

With a play-to-earn model, Axie Infinity is a name that brings a new wave with successful development in the past time. This is a Crypto project conceived by Vietnamese team & launched in 2018. Axie Infinity is built on Loom Network - a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Inspired by the popular game series Pokémon and CryptoKitties, players in Axie also need to do quests, battle, and exchange items with other users at the Marketplace.

Each Axie in the game can be purchased and owned as NFT (Non-fungible token), the player needs to raise them with $SLP (Small love potions). NFT & $SLP items are all exchangeable to $AXS and trade them for profit.

Game Axie Infinity is played not only for fun but also for money, these criteria have affected the majority of Filipinos. In particular, during the Covid 19 epidemic season, Axie's hotness spread even more. From the elderly to young children, everyone downloads & plays games to earn money, which has helped Filipinos have a great source of income in the most difficult time.

AXS is a utility token representing Axie Infinity that serves as an in-game reward & exchange item.","self","https://redd.it/s9o0mo"

After using Pancake Swap for several months and many tokens, I also started Swapping tokens with UniSwap. My first experiences were really bad: many errors and no swaps. The standard slipping percentage is 25% percent, and changing it, means no swapping.  


The first coin I managed to swap, was:  


Shibnobi (SHINJA) - 0xab167e816e4d76089119900e941befdfa37d6b32  


The Transaction in EtherScan:

The only way to Swap this token was to agree with the enormous fee UniSwap showed me, and I accepted: MAX 0.00456203 ETH ($ 49,01). This fee is ridiculous: the amount of ETH for the trade itself is only 0.00364963 ETH ($ 9.0567).   


Only for this first time, I agreed and hoped for a fee much lower than the maximum Fee Uniswap 'promised' me.  


The reality was much worse: UniSwap just took 0.05439423 ETH: this is about $133,77 ! More than one hundred dollars for a small swap... 

Can somebody please tell me how this is possible? Does Uniswap lie and steel my coins or did I make a big and expensive mistake?  


Thanks!  


Sybrand

**TLDR**:

Option contracts are a way to hedge against volatility (price movement) in the market. Other ways include futures contract and swapping.

In general, higher volatility means higher risk because prices move more. That affects people's demand for option prices. Form options contracts, we can also tell how bullish or bearish the market is.

**Get smart:** Options are a tool that can be used to hedge against risks or to bet in the market. Difficult tool, but powerful when used right.

**Get smarter:** CeFi options for crypto exists. And DeFi options protocols are coming right up.

# General Conclusion

2 types of volatility — external volatility (aka market) and implied volatility (aka internal). They are useful factors when understanding your assets.

**FactorsBeyond Volatility**

Volatility is not the only thing you should care about when looking at your (crypto) assets. Also note the other data and factors.

* Micro Economy: Inflation of assets
* Macro Ecosystem: Market Conditions. Market could change and that affects the assets.
* Past Data: Beyond micro and macro markets it's also good to look at historical data to look at past data to get some reference and understanding. Note: *Past data does not define future performance*

**Historical Volatility vs Implied Volatility**

There are two types of volatility. One is the market volatility and the other is implied volatility. In a very simple way it's basically historical volatility and future volatility.

**Historical volatility:** It is based on past data and on all the information that is already given.

**Future volatility:** It is based on people's expectations of the assets and here you calculate based on how people pay for the expected assets.

**Higher Volatility = Higher Risk**

The general notion about volatility is that higher volatility = high risk.

Sometimes it is called educated gambling or educated speculation but **it's not always true**. The general notion of higher volatility means that the price will move more and when the prices move more, higher risk will be experienced. But it really depends on the trading strategy because that will help to mitigate different risks as when you have something with high volatility you can do something else to try and offset the risk or try to reduce that risk.

# What is Market Volatility?

>It's a statistical measure of how ""spread"" is the value from the middle average. More spread (like a pancake) means higher volatility. Less spread (like a mountain) means lower volatilty.

1. **Uses Past Data:** It's historical volatility or using past data to get some understanding of where the asset is right now.
2. **Fluctuation of Returns:** It is the fluctuation (movement) of the returns of the prices of the assets. It is measured by measuring the spread of the returns so you can think of it as two bell curves. One bell curve is flat so almost like a very low middle line and it spreads out very widely like a pancake. You have another bell curve like the Mount Everest so it has a very high peak and everything is very narrow towards the peak.

 

**Why do we care?**

These values give us two main information:

1. **Market sentiment:** It is something like the better volatility where we try to figure out what the market is thinking about and how it compares to other assets
2. **Historical spot price:** It is how the asset itself is doing

We use the information to make bets with it or to hedge against the future","self","https://redd.it/sag0jn"

**TLDR**:

Thus, I introduced you to the Trader Joe project and what $JOE is, and provided all details about the project's highlights and tokenomics.

It can be said that Traderjoe is a prominent AMM right now when the TVL of the protocol has surpassed $2B. New products are launched towards an all-in-one platform with the most recent being a lending product. If Traderjoe's lending develops well, it will set the stage for further development related to derivative products.

# General Conclusion

From a brand new AMM project with no initial funding, Trader Joe has gradually established himself as one of Avalanche's top AMMs. Today's article about Trader Joe and $JOE will give you all the information about:

* What is Trader Joe? Trader Joe's Highlights.
* Information about tokenomics.

# What Is Trader Joe?

>TLDR: DEX on Avalanche protocol

Trader Joe is an AMM decentralised exchange platform on the [Avalanche ](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/avalanche-protocol-d56)blockchain. Trader Joe is a fork of Uniswap. There are not too many AMMs on Avalanche yet, but the most popular AMM among users on this blockchain is Pangolin, so it can be said that Trader Joe's direct competitor is Pangolin.

# Highlights

Trader Joe, in addition to being an AMM, also integrates a number of features such as Yield Farming, Lending, Staking, etc. with the aim of becoming an aggregate platform and bringing the best experience to users.

In addition, users can exchange tokens for $LP tokens with just 1 click through the Zap feature — a new feature on AMM.

 

# Products

* Trade: This is a main product which user can swap their tokens.
* Pool: Where user can add liquidity into the pool and earn trading fee. (0.25%)
* Farm: This is an incentive program that encourage LPers provide liquidity and make more benefit.
* Lending: Where user can borrow more assets
* Stake: Stake $JOE to earn revenue.
* Zap: Swap between token and LP token.","self","https://redd.it/sb4uet"

**TLDR**:

Ultimately, tokenising the publication of the book is a new idea and also an interesting approach. This can extend to any right to use services or other resources such as libraries, to access certain features or to represent something. NFT tokens can all achieve these goals easily and they are quite new to be fully applied and known by many people. In the future, we believe the above will become the same as the way social media and e-commerce change users today.

# General Conclusion

What we can build within NFT is amazing because one of the pillars in the economic design framework is mechanism design. With mechanism design, we can build different kinds of mechanisms to allow more efficient allocation or investment in any particular resource. It can be more than just art or graphic design.

What if we can tokenise property rights, and instead of signing a thick legal contract you just sign on your smart contract with an embedded mechanism design! When you are selling and distributing these tokens there is a lot of economics and science behind them and that is what we want to talk about today. I also want to share the experiment that I am working on which is tokenising distribution rights and publishing rights of a book (my book!) as an NFT.

# Problems with Traditional Publishing

How I got started with this idea of tokenising publishing rights as an NFT is that I published a book and it took me two years of failures to finally release it. The first two years were difficult because nobody really wanted to publish the book. I went to a lot of publishing houses and spoke to a lot of editors but they found this to be very niche and risky for them and they did not want to invest. In property rights, long-term investment and allocation efficiency are the two trade-offs. In the investment area, a publishing house does not want to invest in a niche book because they do not know if there is demand for it, which is completely understandable. In addition, the bigger the publishing house the more risk-averse they will be.

# Allocation

Allocation efficiency means that the book needs to be allocated to the right kind of people who are actually interested in this field. Self-publishing is an efficient allocation because you are publishing and distributing it to the right people in your network.

# How the system works

In general, the token will represent the distribution rights for this specific book and the price of this distribution right will increase as more people come in to distribute it. The pricing model here is a way to express the risk aversion of the person distributing the book. When you are buying the distribution right or the NFT to be able to distribute the book during the early stages, it will be a lot cheaper because you are taking on more risk. I want to compensate you for taking on more risk by making it cheaper for you. As you go up the ladder you realise more and more people know about the book and more people are asking for it in different jurisdictions. Now there is an incentive for another person to come in to buy the distribution rights and distribute the book within their jurisdiction. In this scenario, there is less risk because there has already been promotion, advertising, and awareness of the book around the space, so you have to compensate for that by paying a higher price to buy the distribution and publishing rights.

There is a very simple bonding curve to measure how the system works. In the smart contract, you can embed things like expiration limits to the number of books and all those kind of funky things.

# The Need for Tokenisation

Tokenisation exists because it is a very powerful way to do internal calculations or accounting. When Bitcoin started, it was a way to create this global accounting system to correlate the buy-side and the demand on the sell-side. This is the same for physical books; there are distribution rights and agents will sell the books within their jurisdiction. Every time you sell the book you are promoting it in a lot of different ways.

Some people do not want to buy the physical book and just want the e-book. E-books are quite hard to calculate because someone living in Thailand might look at the book that is promoted in New Zealand but buy the book for a friend in San Francisco. In this case, it crosses many jurisdictions and compensating that advertising to the right kind of people is important. This is where tokens come in and the proportion of physical books sold can be used to calculate how much of the profits generated by the e-books will be added to these distributors so it becomes a new revenue stream for the distributors.

# Reselling & Licensing

The [paper](https://anthonyleezhang.github.io/pdfs/dl.pdf) that Professor Anthony Lee Zhang wrote talks about depreciating licenses, where after a certain time a part of the license is resold to the market and you have to purchase it back to continue using it. If you don't want to use it anymore then you can resell it to someone else.

Everything can be done using the second price auction method which is the mechanism that was awarded the Nobel Prize last year. It is an evolution of this new area of mechanism and market design that is currently flourishing in the economic space.

There are a lot of ways that we can play around with this in the traditional world but I want to take these concepts and apply them in crypto because the testing time or experimentation term is a lot faster. It is a lot better for us to test these kinds of economic theses. As economists, we love creating and building beautiful models with a lot of assumptions that everyone is rational. Sometimes reality is not like that and the best way to test these theories is through actual experimentation.

If these experiments could be in radio spectrum or 5G spectrum allocation that would be great, but it is a bit too risky at this stage for government to come and experiment around in this space. We can start experimenting on a smaller scale like the licensing of book distribution so that we can figure out if there is allocation and investment efficiency and start scaling up from there to a lot of different areas. We can do this for other licensing mechanisms and in something like layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain validator allocation, especially when we are moving to the proof of stake system.","self","https://redd.it/sbx6pu"

**TLDR:**

These interesting terms are used often in the crypto and DeFi space. I hope these explanation is easy for you to understand. If you have more terms you'd like a human explanation on, please comment in this newsletter or email them via replying to this newsletter.

# General Classification

You hear these terms often. These are general blockchain terms.

* You are a retail crypto-trader: does not affect you that much
* You are a developer: affects you depending on what are you building
* You are a regulator: affects you depending on what you want to regulate

# 1) Layer 1

Layer 1 is just the base layer.

If you imagine there's blockchain has different a kind of blocks this is basic layer 1 as in a tech stack and then on top, you could have another kind of systems, processes and technological stack.

**Crypto Examples:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot. These are different kinds of layer 1 solutions and you could build things on top of them.

**Tech world examples:** IMAP protocol to send your email from gmail .com to [yahoo .com](http://yahoo.com/).

**Why is the distinction important?** The economics involved in layer one is very different from the economics of layer 2 and the other kind of layers.

## 2) Layer 2

If layer 1 is the base layer, layer 2 is something that's being built upon it. Layer 2 is usually the scalable solutions and that helps transactions faster.

Layer 1 is good. The objective is to send data in a distributed way and to make sure the other attacks don't happen. That's security. And usually, it means to sacrifice scalability. Layer 2 solves this.

**Crypto Examples:** Lightning network, Plasma chain, and zk-Rollups.

**Tech world examples:** 5G vs 2G

**Why is layer 2 important?** It helps with mainstream adoption for other digital products and services that need speed.

## 3) Dapp

Dapps are decentralised applications. They can be related to finance (DeFi), esports (usually NFT), art (also NFT). They are built on top of Layer 1 or Layer 2. These are applications that you can use.

**Crypto Examples:** Yearn, Nexus Mutual, and Axie Infinity

**Tech world examples:** iOS/Andriod is Layer 1. Instagram app, Telegram app, and web broswer are Dapp.

**Why is Dapp important?** You can hold $ETH or $BTC or $DOT. There's nothing much you can do with it. Dapps are applications where you can have more use-cases with your tokens.

# DeFi General Terms

Another set of terms you hear often. These are general finance terms specific to crypto.

* You are a retail crypto-trader: affects you. Basically your bread and butter.
* You are a developer: affects you depending on what are you building.
* You are a regulator: affects you depending on what you want to regulate.

## 4) DeFi

DeFi: decentralised finance.

DeFi looks to reduce intermediaries in the financial space by decentralising the operations. That is different from the capital market, aka traditional (centralised) finance. Sometimes, that is known as TradFi or CeFi.

**What will be decentralised?** The entire governance mechanism and technology layer will be completely decentralised. And the beginning for DeFi was Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer currency.

Now the cryptocurrency space has grown a bit more. We have lending platforms, d-exchanges, derivatives, insurance and the aggregators. So, decentralised finance has developed a lot of things beyond just p2p lending and Bitcoin.

**DeFi Examples:** P2P currency and technology to remove double-spending

**CeFi examples:** Currency issued by the central bank

**Why is DeFi important?** It opens up financial access to everyone without intermediaries.

## 5) Money Lego

Go back to being a child. You are playing with Lego. You can stack them up and create different types of Lego structure.

Now you are an adult. You play with a different type of Lego. It's money Lego. That means the various technological pieces as lego bricks to build new financial product or infrastructure.

More specifically, it is to combine various products (lending, exchange, options, insurance) and connect them to other products.

For Example, we have ETH and want to trade/hedge. So that, we can mortgage ETH on Compound to receive DAI and transfer DAI to a pool on Uniswap to buy more ETH. Or we can go to derivatives platform and hedge our positions. This is Money Lego that you can stack many types of protocols.

**DeFi Examples:** Collateralise ETH on Compound to borrow DAI (lending) and exchange it for Cream (exchange) and use Cream to stake in various liquidity pools to get an annualised return.

**CeFi world examples:** A similar example is Repo.

**Why is Money Lego important?** This allows for each protocol to specialise in a specific financial instrument and allow anyone to use them as a tool to create new products.

## 6) Composability

Composability is a systems design principle. A protocol can be broken down by different functions and its functions can be used for other purposes. Compostability is very similar to Money Lego.

Different protocols are created with specific purposes, but you can use their functions to achieve your goals.

For example, you can combine the loan functionality of Compound + exchange from Uniswap and provide liquidity on Sushiswap = to create a decentralised derivative exchange with one click. Instead of building everything from scratch. That's the general idea of DeFi, which is evolving very quickly.","self","https://redd.it/scrhy2"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community. With this site is also possible to direct withdraw to coinbase for BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, DOGE, ADA, ATOM, ALGO, BAT, EOS, LINK, XLM, XTZ, XRP

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock","self","https://redd.it/sd8atr"

This is not financial advice. **TLDR**:When discussing about ""Ethereum killer"", it is not just about fighting the layer 1 tech infrastructure. The truth is that there are risks that needs to be mitigated in this infrastructure. In fact, the attack by flashbots is much higher than 51% attack. Thus, this remains as a real risk in the Ethereum network.

# General Conclusion

In an emerging environment like Layer 1 blockchain, it is not uncommon to have competitors. For instance, there are many projects calling themselves ""Ethereum killers"". There is an argument to be made against monopolies in the L1 infrastructure, but it is also about solving different vulnerabilities in Ethereum itself.

## What are the Vulnerabilities?

>Arbitrage bots front-running the transactions.

**What?** I tell the Ethereum network that I want to make a transaction. i.e. buying 100 ETH on Uniswap. This action will take some time to confirm. During this period, it goes into this pool called Mempool. There, everyone can see that ""hey, Lisa is going to buy 100 ETH. It is not executed yet.""**The risk?** Because this is public, bots can come in to pre-trade. They are called flashbots. The basically front-run your trade. They execute the trade before you.**How?** By paying more fees to prioritise their transactions before yours.

# What Is Flashbot?

Bots or network robots are software applications that run automated tasks on the network. Typically, bots perform simple tasks and have a repetitive structure at a much higher frequency than humans can manage. They automatically find, analyse and organise information from web servers at speeds much higher than human speed.Flashbots are like bots, but built with smart contracts (specifically, Ethereum Blockchain) to perform profitable and fast transactions without going through a human. They are also pre-programmed to repeat preset actions over and over.

# Inside The Dark Forest (Mempool) And Hunters (Flashbots)

>In the mempool, it's all dark and murky. The flashbots can find the trade and execute before you. And they win.

Dark Forest is an environment in which there are dangerous hunters, and if you are caught, death is likely. A job as a person's position is hunting us. (This is also the concept that inspired the Dark Forest game on Ethereum testnet.)In Mempool, these clever predators take the form of ""arbitrage bots"". They keep track of pending transactions and try to exploit the profitable opportunities they create.The one who understands Flashbots best is smart contract researcher Phil Daian, who along with colleagues wrote Flash Boys 2.0 article and came up with the term ""Miner Extractable Value"" (MEV).

>How? Flashbots look for any transaction that they can profitably front-run by copying it and replacing the address with its own address.

Phil once talked about a ""Generalised Frontrunner"" flashbot that looks for transactions in Mempool (such as DEX transactions or Oracle update) and tries to pre-run them according to a predefined algorithm. **Flashbots look for any transaction that they can profitably front-run by copying it and replacing the address with its own address.** They can also execute transactions and copy beneficial internal transactions generated by its execution trace.","self","https://redd.it/sdiigb"

# Economic misalignment

Economic misalignment is when a participant faces a decision that might benefit one class of agent at the expense of others. It is important to spot these and resolve them in the design of the protocol.

It is not uncommon to have a zero sum game. In such a game, favouring one party means penalising other agents. We have realised that there is a reallocation of risk from some agents to other agents in many algo stablecoin protocols.

You can see that when this happens, there is a clear transfer of risk from agents with the coupon model. This happens when:

* the price moves
* you can make a governance decision
* you have to wait to buy a coupon
* you want to have a target price in mind to sell those assets

You can argue that ""this is common in any trade"". Yes, you are right. But here, the risk is massive because sometimes these models do not allow for the coupons to be redeemed unless the price goes above one for a specific amount of time. This risk was maybe mis-priced by those agents with asymmetric information, so this is what we mean by economic misalignment and risk that is transferred from agent to agent.

You could also see it as an asymmetry of opportunities (rather than information). This was very clear at the launch of those protocols where some agents were really able to amass a lot of tokens very early on and so were able to influence the decision later on to benefit themselves. This is especially for the protocols that have open and extreme governance. We see this happening with ESD and DSD, where the early whales left the system amassing millions in profits.

>**Takeaway here:** A very important factor to consider is who those protocols give the voting power to, and how early they give that power, and who are the large token holders that are basically hoarding tokens.

# Coupon Failures: Incentives VS Stability

The issue here was that incentives were not really designed to improve stability, which was quite a surprise for us. When we were doing the analysis, we realised that the decisions of some mechanisms were not oriented and focused on insuring and assuring stability — quite the opposite. They sometimes created more volatility. That is interesting because a stablecoin needs to be stable in the first place but some mechanisms were focusing on incentivising volatility.

## Good and Bad solutions

The movement of the market or the risk of price movement is the sort of negative effect that falls on agents. This is extremely important for stablecoins because all we want is for them to have zero volatility or have a minimum price.

Inflating the supply with coupons and tokens that are not valuable (e.g. the ESD and DSD coupon models) is unsustainable and creates more volatility in the long run. However, if the underlying coupon supply can accrue value, that is a different situation. An example of this is LUNA.

LUNA is required to approve transactions on the Terra blockchain which actually brings value to the system. It is a mechanism where you are helping the model and helping stability through the adoption of the system itself. This is a good boost for the demand of the secondary token LUNA and reduces the problem of a negative feedback loop, which is the main failure of the pure coupon model.

 

# Conclusion

We have touched on an aspect of secondary financial instruments (coupons, bonds, and all those newly devised financial instruments). We asked ourselves if these are a good deal and the answer, unfortunately, is no, because rational agents will not involve themselves with these secondary tokens **if they really understand the risk that they run.** Now, the protocols have a following of new participants or new users and the excitement that comes with that, but we really need much much more solidity. With ESDs or DSDs the incentives of purchasing coupons have been deviating away from when the mechanism is mostly needed, which is under contraction.","self","https://redd.it/se978s"

 **TLDR**: When it comes to fixed interest rates, it is the interest rate swap and the variable interest rate. Because of this, you can see that projects will often do the fixed interest rate and interest rate swap/market.**Get smart:** DeFi's current situation is yet to meet that demand, but this could be the starting point for DeFi's fixed-rate and swap-rate segment.

# General Conclusion

Last week on the fixed interest rate, we covered zero coupon bond. The coupon is paid upfront or at maturity and divided equally per month.Another method to get a fixed interest rate is via Interest Rate Swap. That is what we will focus in this article today.

# What's Interest Rate Swap?

>Swap is a financial derivative product consisting of 2 transacting parties making a series of payments to the other in a certain period.

As you can imagine, it is to swap the interest rate. We exchange the interest rates.E.g. I have an asset that has a changing interest rate. It pays me 3%, 2%, 3.5%, 0.17%, 4.2%. Instead, I want it to give me a consistent 2% instead.How do we do this? Via interest rate swaps.Why do we want this? Because we prefer something stable and consistent. It helps with financial management.

## Types of Swaps

>There are 4 kinds of swaps based on underlying asset properties: **Currency swap, Interest rate swap, Equity swap and commodity swap.**

The interest rate swap has 2 transacting parties performing a series of interest payments to the other. Both payments are in the same currency. One party pays floating interest, the other can pay at a floating or fixed rate.***Note: you only swap the interest rate. Not the asset itself.***In this analysis, we focus on the interest rate swap, which has one side paid by paying the float interest rate. The other side is paid by the fixed interest rate. This also is called a **Plain Vanilla Swap.**

## Swap Details

Swaps have a

1. begin date
2. end date
3. interest payment period

As a future contract, swaps do not have any party prepayment. So swaps have an initial value = 0. That means present value (PV) is the same. The date which payment occurs called settlement date and the time interval between two payments is called a payment cycle.Payments will usually occur for a short period of time, usually 1 day. This is because floating rates often change continuously, so payments will have to be made within the specified time.Each Swap is materialised by a transaction amount called **estimated capital.** Because Interest Rate Swaps include the payment of interest, the settlement of which is calculated by multiplying the period of the interest by the initial capital which is never paid out. Therefore, it is not called the initial capital but rather the estimated capital.

**TLDR**:

Polygon demand is growing due to a shortage in Layer 1 infrastructure. The solutions offered by Polygon are perfectly suited to the current market needs.

In terms of design mechanism, Polygon focuses entirely on network activities. Voting incentives are undertaken by the core team. $MATIC holders have voted only for selecting Block Producers. In terms of token mechanism, $MATIC has major benefits from the point of view of transaction verification. Providing evidence of fraud is also rewarded.

In the future, Polygon will do well until Layer 1 has a better, cheaper way for users to improve performance. For example, when Ethereum's Sharding launches, that network will operate more efficiently and cheaply, so the demand from Polygon will decrease. However, Polygon is developing solutions that Layer 1s themselves take a lot of time to develop. This is the potential that Polygon will be able to achieve in the future.

# Introduction

Up to now, when the bottlenecks of the Ethereum network have not been able to be fully resolved, Layer 2 solutions have stepped in, revealing their remarkable advantages.

Formerly Matic Network, Polygon has great ambitions to deploy all layer 2 solutions for themselves, to be an all-in-one solution platform for both users and developers.

# What is Polygon? What is $MATIC?

The token is $MATIC and Polygon used to be MATIC about three years ago. There are three groups of developers who had this idea of creating layer 2 just for the Ethereum layer. They called it MATIC. They've been working for some time and today it is live! Now it has changed to Polygon.

## Layer 1

Layer 1 is the base layer which is things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, etc. This is the core underlying fundamental layer that allows all these different transactions to work. All the transactions that are taking place go into this big database that is layer 1.

## Layer 2

Layer 2 is the smaller database that exists on top of the layer 1 database for faster and cheaper transactions. As you know, the transactions on layer 1 are very expensive because it is more secure. So, if there is going to be a lot more art going around or a lot more NFTs being created, we do not want to be paying so much money all the time. This is where layer 2 comes in because we have faster and cheaper transactions in layer 2 which is the perfect use case for NFTs.

# How does Polygon work?

Polygon works in four composable layers:

## The Ethereum Layer

I call this the OG layer or the original layer. This is where the core basic or the fundamental architecture involving different transactions is recorded which is like a huge core database.

This is where finality, staking, disputes, messaging and all these different crypto-related verifications happen. This is very secure but because it's so secure you sometimes have to make a trade-off in terms of scalability.

## The Security Layer

This layer exists above the Ethereum layer and runs parallel to it. It is like a synthetic world or the Sims world. You exist in real life but in your Sims computer game, you have this person that is living a similar life with you although in a different kind of house.

It's the same idea where you have all these transactions happening on the Ethereum layer and on the security layer they run parallel with each other. You can share the different kinds of validation in the Ethereum layer and the security layer.","self","https://redd.it/sfvy6u"

I want to be able to develop a program that is able to take in a date and the contract address for a pairing and it’s able to give me the price of that asset at that exact day and time.

I’ve scoured etherscan APIs and looked in all sorts of places but there doesn’t seem to be a simple way to access this data. Dextools uses TradingView for all of their charts so surely that data must be housed somewhere (maybe on-chain?) and therefore be accessible? 

Does anyone have any idea how I could go about doing this? Where exactly do I need to look to retrieve this historical data? Or alternatively point me in the direction of any discords/etc that would be able to help me.

Scraping etherscan won’t work as the prices on tx pages are often the most up to date prices instead of being the price at time of tx. At any rate scraping probably isn’t a sustainable long term option and I’d prefer being able to access an API instead.

This is not financial advice. **TLDR**:Frax, the project has a different approach than all other algorithmic stablecoins with a model of 2 tokens that complement each other. When $FRAX becomes stable, the supply of FXS decreases, and when $FRAX decreases in value, the supply of $FXS increases.

# General Conclusion

$FRAX is the first fractional algorithmic stablecoin protocol with the goal of providing a highly scalable and decentralised cryptocurrency. In the FRAX protocol, there are two active tokens, $FRAX (stablecoin) and $FXS (FRAX shares).

# Classifying Stablecoins

There are four main categories:

1. Mechanism
2. Peg
3. Collateral Amount
4. Collateral Type

$FRAX uses three mechanisms: dual token, reserve-based mechanism, and algorithmic mechanism. It is soft-pegged to the US dollar. $FRAX is partially collateralised so it has 100% or fewer assets or reserve backing the value of the token. It uses on-chain assets and there are two main assets in place:

1. The stablecoin, so $USDC and $USDT, which is the collateral amount itself
2. Collateralised by the secondary token which is the $FRAX Share Token ($FXS)

## Dual Token

This means that there are two tokens in the system — $FRAX and $FXS.$**FRAX**: It is soft-pegged to the US dollar and is not very volatile. It maintains the peg which is the desired outcome.$**FXS:** This token captures the value that is within the ecosystem as well as being a governance token. Three types of value can be accrued by the $FXS:

1. Value creation from seigniorage shares of the $Frax
2. The fees collected by the ecosystem
3. Any excess collateral amount of value that is being accrued

## Reserves

$FRAX is also backed by reserves and is under collateralised. If it is 20% backed by $USDC, for example, then the other 80% needs to be $FSX. $FRAX is backed 100% by assets and a part of it is $USDC which is acknowledged by everyone and can be traded anywhere. $FSX is an asset created within the ecosystem and is more valued in the ecosystem than outside.

### Reserve Backed Asset Classification

$FRAX can be used to redeem the underlying collateral which means every $FRAX that you mint or burn is linked to some amount of $USDC and some amount of $FRAX.

# $FRAX

$FRAX is also an algorithmic stablecoin that is stabilised via mortgaging of assets and burning $FXS. Currently, the assets used as collateral to create $FRAX only have stablecoins such as $USDC and $USDT before in due course allowing collateral with other assets.

>$FRAX is minted/redeemed to peg at $1.

The total value of $FRAX minted is guaranteed to be equal to the sum of the value of $FXS (the number of $FXS to be burned). When $FRAX is redeemed, the user will get back the collateral and $FXS at the same value (amount of $FXS minted). For example, $USDC's collateral rate is 99%, so to generate $1 worth of $FRAX requires $0.99 worth of $USDC and $0.1 worth of $FXS. Or, at a collateral rate of 98%, to redeem 1 $FRAX the user will receive $0.98 in $USDC and $0.2 in $FXS.Details of the formula for calculating the amount of minting/redeem $FRAX you can find here.

## Minting $FRAX

This is a four-step process:

1. Determine how much $USDC you have: E.g 100 $USDC
2. You want to figure out what is the collateral (C) ratio that the system has, and the C ratio is protocol wide. Let us say it is 75% which means that 75% in collateral is $USDC or $USDT and 25% is $FXS
3. Find out how much $FXS is needed: Let's say $FRAX is $2.6

* $1 \* 100 $USDC \* 25% (1 – collateral ratio or 75%) = $2.6 \* $FXS\* 75%
* $FXS= 12.82  

1. Calculate how much $FRAX is going to be minted?

* FRAX Minted = collateral value + $FXS value
* FRAX= 100($USDC)\* $1 + 12.82($FXS)\*$2.6 = 133.33 $FRAX

# Maintaining Stability

## Arbitrage

One of the main things in any stablecoin ecosystem is that the ecosystem itself will always recognise the stablecoin as 1 dollar which is very important because this is how arbitrage happens. Arbitrage is when the same asset has two different values in different places. You can buy from a place where it is cheaper and sell it at a place where it is more expensive.

### >$1

When it is more than 1 dollar then users will want to mint $FRAX and sell it in the secondary market.

### <$1

When it is less than 1 dollar people will buy from the secondary market and sell it in the primary market. Selling means burning and redeeming it for the underlying collateral. This helps to balance the system back to 1 dollar because supply is reduced which helps to bring the prices up.

# C-Ratio Update

The other important thing is the C ratio update. $FRAX itself wants to update the C ratio quite dynamically. The C ratio as mentioned is a system-wide matrix-like Alchemix, but it allows you to change which is similar to Maker because they have a different kind of C ratio within the system.

## PID Controller

The C ratio is maintained using the PID controller which is something that was updated in Q1 of this year. It updates the C ratio based on the growth rate which is a relative matrix, to understand the price of $FRAX as well as the circulating supply of $FXS. When the price of $FRAX increases or decreases it affects the total supply of $FRAX shares available.When it is more than 1 dollar people mint more $FRAX and when it is less than 1 dollar people will burn and redeem it for the underlying $FXS. This increases or decreases the supply and affects the prices. There is a relationship between the $FXS and the $FRAX which is important in maintaining the stability of the system.They calculate a simple ratio to understand the relationship between the circulating supply of $FXS as well as the total supply of $FRAX available. Using this ratio they will update the collateral amount or the collateral ratio by the entire system. It's like a small controller where you can change the knobs of the entire system. You can increase or decrease the C ratio based on the relationship of $FRAX versus the $FXS.","self","https://redd.it/sgjqsy"

# TLDR

The early internet needed avant-garde programmers and businesses to develop new products to make the Internet useful and to be rewarded for the value they created. No one knows in advance what the consequences of their construction will be.Cryptonetworks, with their open-source protocols and everyone-owned networks, offers the opportunity to restructure the Internet into a system that benefits more people around the world. This is a vision worth striving for.The world evolving today is increasingly controlled by technology, so we must design systems that benefit the collective. The transformation of the Internet, from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0, is diverse and will change the way we interact with the Internet.

# General Conclusion

In early 2021, we had discussions on the idea of building a decentralised Internet, commonly referred to as Web 3.0.

* In the United States President Trump has been banned from - using Twitter, and Parler, which uses AWS services, has been removed from PlayStore and AppStore.
* WhatsApp has announced that they will share information with their parent company Facebook
* Uganda has ordered internet service providers to block all social networking platforms

These are important and understandable issues and need to be actively discussed.Small businesses and startups rely on Facebook advertising services, Google search suggestions, and Amazon's AWS service to survive. Artists and creators face the risk of having their information deleted from sites like Spotify, Instagram and Tiktok. Although these are not new problems, it is becoming more and more serious. The development of technology monopolies and their scalability to information privacy rights and personal freedoms has spurred the Internet transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.

# What Is Web 3.0?

Web 3.0 (commonly called Web3) is a reform model aimed at democratising the Internet. Web 3.0 is present in the Crypto Space and other digital fields such as AI, Virtual and Augmented Reality, and more. By applying new technologies, Web 3.0 is changing how we, as a collective, view and value the Internet. Web 3.0 is about creating an Internet that works for everyone, owned by everyone.

# Where Web 3.0 Comes From

The term was originally coined in 2014 and popularised in 2018 by Ethereum co-founder and Polkadot founder Gavin Wood. The spirit of this term goes back to when Satoshi developed Bitcoin and advocated decentralised DNS called BitDNS.

>“I think it would be possible for BitDNS to be a completely separate network and separate blockchain, yet share CPU power with Bitcoin.” - Satoshi (2010)

DNS has long been controlled by organisations such as Verisign and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) overseen by the US Department of Commerce. This centralised control of DNS has been used to enforce IP rights, prohibit websites from selling copyrighted material, censor free-of-speech sites like WikiLeaks and seize domain names (IP addresses) without proper procedures, etc. Censorship decisions are usually influenced by the top levels of government and the lobbyists of the largest multinational organisations, who may not always be acting in the best interests of the general public.Satoshi and other Bitcoin enthusiasts recognised this. In 2011, a fork of Bitcoin called Namecoin was born to allow censorship-proof domains at *.bit* domain addresses.Namecoin was ahead of its time. A proxy service or extension (such as MetaMask today) was required to log in at the *.bit* domain, making it very difficult to use. Plus, most people did not want their own website or personal domain at that time. All of this caused Namecoin to fail because of low demand from its users.Ten years later and now new blockchains and decentralised services may be ready for success. These applications are making the Internet more decentralised with Web 3.0. Another example of such infrastructure is the Handshake network.","self","https://redd.it/shexwt"

[https://flappyinu.io](https://flappyinu.io/)

What is this token all about?

It’s inspired by the game Flappy bird. The creators of Flappy Inu believe combining gaming and crypto will become the future of gaming. In preparation for this, they are aiming to bring back the popular game flappy bird with a few Shiba-like modifications. The flappy bird in the game for example is a Shiba bird. It is an intelligent strategy employed to market video games and crypto together in a subtle but intriguing way. The game is now available on their website.

Now what?

Here is a direct quote from their white paper “On a smaller scale Flap aims to develop the most popular decentralized crypto gaming ecosystem, FlapWorld, where Flap will be the main currency”. Users will be able to access features and levels within the game by holding Flap and NFTs created by Yoshi and the team”. They have multiple developments and a lot of bold claims. They say you are going to be able to connect your wallet to the game and if you hold certain tokens the game will change by adding new levels and features. Which I think is pretty cool.

How is it not a scam?

On their website, they have posted the burn of half their supply on Etherscan. They have burnt their LP tokens and have posted on their website the Etherscan link. Essentially ensuring that it is impossible to rug pull. They also go into great detail on how they are transparent on their whitepaper. Saying everything they do will be public and the community will have a say.

What is my opinion?

I think the creators have created something special. Flappy Inu has a fun and intriguing platform to attract users of all backgrounds. Staying ahead of the future trends in gaming and crypto is hard, but not impossible. Flappy Inu presents a relatively easy low-risk opportunity to get ahead of the curve as there is a particularly large market for gaming tokens like Flappy Inu to grow exponentially as crypto does. Finally, who doesn't love a flappy Shiba bird?","self","https://redd.it/shmovj"

**TLDR**:

The Greek indicators helps us to understand the risks involved. They are different for different types of options.

Because the conditions are constantly changing, ""the Greeks"" provides traders with the means to determine the sensitivity of a particular trade to price movements, volatility and timing. Incorporating an understanding of these indicators can be of great help to accurately price your options.

# General Conclusion

Derivative tools include not only the tools for the prevention of risks but also the means to control the risks. The activities related to prevention are called **risk management**. It is about determining the level of risk an entity wants, identifying the level of risk it is taking, and using derivative tools to adjust the level of risk as desired.

Trying to predict what will happen to the price of an option or a position involving multiple options based on market changes can be a daunting task. Because options prices are not always in sync with the underlying asset's, it is important to understand what factors contribute to the movement's price movement and the effects they have.

Options traders usually refer to the delta, gamma, vega and theta of their option positions. These Greeks help us to understand option prices with quantitative factors. Aka using numbers to make sense of metrics that affects option pricing.

These terms may sound confusing and intimidating at first to new traders, but as we take a closer look at them, the Greeks cover simple concepts that can help you understand clearly the potential reward and risk of an options trade.

# Why Do We Have To Manage Risks?

**The Motivation For Risk Management**

The main reasons for implementing risk valuation are concerns related to asset price volatility or other factors affecting an entity from the market.

**The Benefit Of Risk Management**

* Minimise bankruptcy.
* Increase or decrease the desired risk.
* Determine the costs and profits before accepting them.

# Values Of Metrics

The numbers given for each Greek are correct on a theoretical basis, which means (these) values are calculated based on mathematical models. Most of the information you need to trade options are the following: a bid/ask price, quantity, and open interest. These information are the actual data received from different options trades.","self","https://redd.it/siau2f"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community. With this site is also possible to direct withdraw to coinbase for BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, DOGE, ADA, ATOM, ALGO, BAT, EOS, LINK, XLM, XTZ, XRP

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock","self","https://redd.it/sir8wo"

Gyroscope Overview

Gyroscope is an all-weather stablecoin that is decentralised, scalable, and highly liquid, based on revolutionary new designs. It is not out yet, still in testnet phase. But we would like to share how the protocol works. It is reserve-based and the reserve ratio, in the long run, is supposed to be 100%. There are two tokens in the system, the $GYD and the governance token.

Three main highlights of GYD:

1. All-weather stablecoin
2. Dual AMM mechanism
3. Still in development

Mechanisms:

1. **Reserve based:** The reserve ratio, in the long run, is supposed to be 100%.
2. **Algorithmic:** It has a dual AMM model which is basically an AMM in the primary market and an AMM in the secondary market.
3. **Dual-token system:** There are two tokens in the system — the $GYD or gyro dollar itself, and the governance token which is used to set system parameters.

Peg

It is soft-pegged to US dollars. Instead of an external oracle, it uses a dual-AMM mechanism to maintain and balance its peg.

Collaterals

It is soft pegged to USD. It is algorithmic in the sense of the stablecoin creation, so it can fluctuate a little bit, but there is a hard stop in how far the prices can fall. This is a pretty good improvement compared to all the other stablecoins.

It is more than 100% collateralised and there are different kinds of stablecoins to mint the stablecoin. The collateral for each kind of stablecoin is different, based on how risky they are so that is something to take note of — not all collaterals are worth the same. Everything goes into one big vault and there are different c ratios for all of them.

Coordination among different decentralised participantsEconomic agents

**Gyro holders:** People who are minting the $GYD. The general users would be the $GYD holders and they have a veto power to overwrite any governance that is not helpful to the system.

**Governors:** The governance role will then be the management of the funds or the management of the collateral. The way to make sure that they are incentivised to do the right thing is that the cash flow returns are delayed for a period of time so that you bind them to make sure that they continuously behave properly otherwise they do not get the returns.

**Liquidity providers:** The third type is yield farmers or liquidity providers. They help to utilize $GYD and help to maintain stability by doing arbitrage.","self","https://redd.it/siy4sk"

**TLDR**:

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. Education, off-chain integration, as well as governance, are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this renaissance truly impactful. It is not just protesting on the streets or arguing with people on Twitter. These are tangible things that we can do right now to make a very big significant difference in the future.

# What Has History Taught Us?

One way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation.

Throughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century. A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasn't just religious and they actually acted as a political entity. The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers. Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy.

During the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off. They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid. They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently.

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didn't have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action. There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time — the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping i.e. a ledger.

## Ledger

Ledger was absolutely radical at that point in time. Credit and debit and left and right was something new. Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era. Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities. It was like magic where all of a sudden, the power brokers didn't have absolute control over the monetary system. You could essentially prevent false forks, increase velocity and composability. As a result, there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledger-based accounting and reconciliation system for contracts. It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole proto-capitalistic or proto-economic class.

## Printing Press

When we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines. They were almost like the memes of the day. It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a year's or 10-year’s salary to have a scribe make the copy. It was locked away under permission and observability. Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract. The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree.

The technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised. The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information. They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.

Only like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.

# How Can Tokens Coordinate Market Creation?

Society is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate. This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact, which is coordination. The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform. This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring, which is a tool for incentivisation.

People only do things because they are incentivised to do so. Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat. The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so. People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade. This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination.

In the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high. They were allowed (granted permission) and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else. This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a person’s connection with someone else.

What happened with the advent of ledger-based accounting was that it broke those markets apart, so, basically, decentralisation happened. Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of double-entry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way. It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small.

We can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time, at our pace, and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically, and that has massive benefits to markets

# Crypto Success: How Can Everyone Get Access To It?

What happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was have-nots. Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class. We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart. We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking people's jobs. Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs — it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.

## Education

There is usually an adoption curve, and the first piece is education. We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation.

## Adoption

Part of crypto's success will be in its adoption and by that I mean: does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon, or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community? It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi, but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power real-world businesses.

We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.

### Current State

Right now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.

### The Future

The future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics. Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life, and then there is a broader circle still about education.

The interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI. Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre. From that perspective, crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system. All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.

# Value Creation

Value creation has shifted from the religion of ""money is everything"" to ""as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable"". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

## Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps?

If we look at human productivity as a linear line then we have very unproductive people and very productive people. Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be, which is integration between machines and humans. We are segregating this line into more segments, and you have different kinds of middle layers being formed so you have small little boutiques catering to very specific sub-segments of people. A feature of this is that one is able to solve specific needs by this specific segment of people in this timeline.

# Micro Token Economies As Nation-States

When we create these little micro-economies we are basically recreating how nation-states work — the legal structure, the social contracts, and the legal contracts in NFTs. We are talking about citizen rights, on-chain rights, and reputation engine.

## Imagined Communities

The way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function. As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything. It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy. I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.

# Conclusion

One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies. You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow. We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails, because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system — then there is no point arguing. It is the best experiment ever.

Education, off-chain integration, as well as governance, are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this truly impactful. It is not just protesting on the streets or arguing with people on Twitter. These are tangible things that we can do right now to make a very big significant difference in the future.","self","https://redd.it/sk0lmv"

This is not financial advice. **TLDR**:Both protocols serve in a potentially thriving derivatives market. Despite the common goal, the product architectures of the two protocols are vastly different.Perpetual Protocol provides star delivery contracts using vAMM Mechanism along with a Funding Rate. Especially when the trader is also LPer for their own position. This gives them higher leverage.Kashi is similar to a lending protocol but includes loan scalability features. That is, instead of mortgaging and getting a loan and mortgaging to get a new one, Kashi has integrated them into a single transaction. However, since the target collateral utilisation is 70-80%, the maximum leverage is quite low, theoretically x3, and Kashi offers x2 as the largest.

# General Conclusion

We shared about DEXes before. They are decentralised exchanges to allow for users to trade. The current popular assets being traded are assets at spot prices. A new improvement to that is margin trading. Margin trading is where you can trade more than the value of your asset. For example, you get to trade 10x the value of the asset that you have. Adding margin trading with DEX model is innovative and that is what we want to focus on today.Margin trading is a small category in DeFi Space. Although this niche does not have too many projects, there are outstanding projects: Kashi (from Sushiswap), dYdX, Perpetual Protocol, and so on.We recently shared about another perpetual swap mechanism in DeFi. Perpetual Swap had become the first product built on-chain for the derivatives market to achieve impressive trading volume numbers. 

# What Problem Does Margin DEX Solve?

When you trade on centralised exchanges (CEX), you will connect the market through an intermediary (exchange), your money will be managed by the exchange (custodial) whether you want it or not. Because of such a centralised model, CEX exchanges are often the top target for hackers to attack.Even the Top CEXs in the industry have been hacked, so I don't think the problem is ""was this exchange hacked or not?"" but ""when?"". In addition to security issues, the CEX exchange also has problems related to user fraud.Margin DEX was created to solve most of the above problems:

* Trustless: Users have access to the marketplace without the need for an intermediary.
* Non-Custodial: Users will be able to control and manage their own assets and do not need to deposit them with any party.
* Transparency: Everything will be operated through Smart Contract on Ethereum and managed by DAO in the future.
* Permissionless: Anyone, anywhere or at any time can access and use the platform of Perpetual Protocol without restricting permissions by anyone.

# Perpetual Protocol

Perpetual Protocol is a protocol that allows the issuance of perpetual futures contracts of any asset. The goal of Perpetual Protocol is to decentralise futures contracts, allowing anyone, anywhere, anytime to access and use the platform for trading without going through 3rd part.The core of the Perpetual Protocol is the project's protocol, which consists of two main parts:

* Virtual Automated Market Makers (Virtual AMMs): A virtual automated market maker (vAMM) model inspired by Uniswap. *Note: PerpProtocol is looking to move away from VAMM model.*
* Liquidity Reserve: Liquidity Reserve as collateral for Virtual AMMs.

# Kashi

This part details how Kashi works, and how it brings revolutionary innovation to L1. We want to explain the tie-up between BentoBox and its upcoming Dapps, including Kashi. BentoBox is a vault, acting as a decentralised “App Store”, where you can deposit assets inside to activate other Dapps.As such, Kashi is a Dapp developed on BentoBox, a margin trading platform backed by its lending protocol that allows users to create lending token pairs of varying degrees, however, they assume that profits can be maximised.","self","https://redd.it/skrfiz"

[https://flappyinu.io](https://flappyinu.io/)

What is this token all about?

It’s inspired by the game Flappy bird. The creators of Flappy Inu believe combining gaming and crypto will become the future of gaming. In preparation for this, they are aiming to bring back the popular game flappy bird with a few Shiba-like modifications. The flappy bird in the game for example is a Shiba bird. It is an intelligent strategy employed to market video games and crypto together in a subtle but intriguing way. The game is now available on their website.

Now what?

Here is a direct quote from their white paper “On a smaller scale Flap aims to develop the most popular decentralized crypto gaming ecosystem, FlapWorld, where Flap will be the main currency”. Users will be able to access features and levels within the game by holding Flap and NFTs created by Yoshi and the team”. They have multiple developments and a lot of bold claims. They say you are going to be able to connect your wallet to the game and if you hold certain tokens the game will change by adding new levels and features. Which I think is pretty cool.

How is it not a scam?

On their website, they have posted the burn of half their supply on Etherscan. They have burnt their LP tokens and have posted on their website the Etherscan link. Essentially ensuring that it is impossible to rug pull. They also go into great detail on how they are transparent on their whitepaper. Saying everything they do will be public and the community will have a say.

What is my opinion?

I think the creators have created something special. Flappy Inu has a fun and intriguing platform to attract users of all backgrounds. Staying ahead of the future trends in gaming and crypto is hard, but not impossible. Flappy Inu presents a relatively easy low-risk opportunity to get ahead of the curve as there is a particularly large market for gaming tokens like Flappy Inu to grow exponentially as crypto does. Finally, who doesn't love a flappy Shiba bird?","self","https://redd.it/sky6ok"

**TLDR**:

The above article has pointed out the problems that DeFI is facing and new projects are solving them. Effective capital is still the top priority of DeFi 2.0 today, that is, trading volume on TVL (DEX) or Outstanding Loan on Total Lending (Lending/Borrowing) must be higher.

We also have to redefine what a protocol is and how effective it is, and if it does, it will give DeFi access to more funding in the future.

# General Conclusion

Recently the keyword “DeFi 2.0” has emerged as a phenomenon along with the rapid growth of several tokens such as Olympus DAO, Klim DAO, Abracadabra, Popsicle Finance, etc. So what is DeFi 2.0? How is it different? Why say DeFi 2.0 has the ability to change the entire DeFi today? And what will we need to prepare for the coming giant wave?

>DeFi 1.0 is the straight-forward simple things like ""I give you $150 worth of ETH. You give me $100 worth of crypto USD.  
>  
>DeFi 2.0 is more risk understanding. Instead of $150 worth of ETH, maybe just $110 worth of ETH or $150 alt-TOKEN to get the same $100 crypto USD.

How is it different from ""DeFi 1.0""? Well.... it's not so different. Similar mechanisms but with higher risk tolerance.

# DeFi 2.0

DeFi is a decentralised finance (or open finance), by leveraging the power of blockchain, DeFi has made it possible for anyone to access and use financial applications anywhere, anytime. not subject to the control of individuals or organisations with centralised power.

However, DeFi currently has many limitations and as the name suggests, DeFi 2.0 is an upgraded version of DeFi, helping to overcome the weaknesses and optimise the advantages of current DeFi. Thereby opening up great potential opportunities for the parties involved.

## Current DeFi Limitation

To understand the problems that DeFi 2.0 solves, we must first know what the problems of DeFi are, the prominent limitations of DeFi include:

* Scalability: Expensive gas fees, long waiting times greatly affect the user experience.
* Liquidity: Liquidity is considered the blood of any trading market, and with DeFi, liquidity is generally low.
* Centralisation: DeFi will not make sense without the word ""De"", although DeFi aims at decentralisation, but with many projects at the present time, the power still belongs to a small part (still remains).
* Security: DeFi is a market with a lot of risks, security in DeFi has not really received much attention compared to their importance.
* Oracle Attack: DeFi depends a lot on Oracle, but many projects still do not understand and underestimate the choice of Oracle to integrate. As a result, the project suffered a lot from related attacks.
* Capital Efficiency: DeFi with many breakthroughs from technology has helped users use capital more effectively, but at the moment, there is a large amount of assets that are still underutilised. opens up many new development potentials for DeFi.","self","https://redd.it/sljhx4"

  1- First, the achievement that Crypto Currency Dapmcoin ( DPCN ) achieved is an important milestone, and achievement for the entire digital currency market in the world. In other words, for all decentralized currencies, this is a historic milestone for the financial market in terms of legal financial technological advancement.

 2- We will make several examples in various ways so that the perception is as clear as possible, regarding the regulation of a Crypto Currency or digital asset.

 3- We all know that something legalized is 100% legal, it has security and transparency and is different from something illegal. A cool thing for more that takes time to appreciate will always be cool with solidity to users.

4- An illegal thing even if it moves trillions inside with liquidity will always be illegal until it is legalized if possible. And something illegal has a tendency to bring harm to many, until certain concepts of it are legalized and edited. It's all that is illegal generates fear and panic in the market.

5- Having a legalized decentralized currency is a key for everyone using the Dapmcoin DPCN currency to feel safe and comfortable using the currency anywhere in the world. For being Crypto Currency active of the global use in a legal way. No possibility of being at risk of responding to some criminal proceedings for using something or using illegal products.

6- Logic experienced by users of Crypto Currencies:

Whenever a country or government speaks ill of a decentralized currency, the market breaks down because it generates
panic and fear because of lack of clarity and regulation. Everyone is afraid because it is a non-regulated product.

7- Regulation leaves transparency and security for the use of anything definitely legal. And it shows that this is not a scam or bubble. But rather of an initiative of new scientific and technological evolution in the financial market, and in other sectors in diverse markets in development with advanced technologies.

 8- The legalization of the Dapmcoin (DPCN) currency emerged from the perspective of seeking the appreciation of Crypto Currencies, in what is inherent to the regulation and legalization of this market. In the context of the same, being used legally in several countries without impediment due to irregularities and boycotts.

9- Crypto Currency Dapm (Dapmcoin) was created and registered and recognized as a Crypto Currency. It is not just about being Crypto Currency because of being created on Blockchain technology and new technological evolution only. It has recognized legal bases for this asset, base of records being Dapmcoin currency in legal records Dapmcoin currency ( DPCN ) is a digital asset and Crypto Currency or digital money. It is not about the simple (TOKEN) representative, it only arises from the result of creation in Blockchain technology only. The DPCN will always be a legal currency or digital asset.


10- Legality:

 It generates security, peace and tranquility for users who use the DPCN currency, knowing that they will not be surprised by the laws of any country, because they are using something illegal. It does not matter which country of origin the user resides. The important thing is that the Dapmcoin  (DPCN) currency is a legalized digital asset and is a digital currency.


 11- Decentralized Currencies believers.

We understand that most people like to use decentralized currencies because they are not regulated, and on the other hand, they do not obey any laws or regulations. This is what generates panic when the laws of each country come into force or take action against Cryptocurrencies. The legal basis of a cryptocurrency or any other product, allows any citizen in any country and anywhere in the world to feel free and protected to use the same thing without fear and criminal persecution.


12- It is on this basis that before launching the Dapmcoin currency we had to choose to register and acquire all legal registrations of the Cryptocurrency Dapmcoin  ( DPCN ) which guarantees us full copyright. It is legal to protect our users of the currency from any illegality that may arise. In this way Dapmcoin is a legal paid digital asset, and not on the basis of speculation or technological creation only. Science must evolve on the basis of law, and it cannot evolve illegally. In two legal and decentralized ways the Cryptocurrency Dapmcoin DPCN is a digital asset of public use in the world.Dapmcoin  (DPCN)

# Introduction

When designing any economy, be it P2E or non-blockchain based, it is important to first consider the types of economic agents in the space. These economic agents can be split into 5 personas - players, builders, developers, investors and NFT collectors.

We see these agents in traditional, non-blockchain based games too, although NFT collectors are the first of its kind. There are investors in non-blockchain games which are also a new dimension as the investor model has shifted. Because we see a new addition to the economic agents involved, the economics of P2E can change drastically, depending on the incentives to them.

For all economic agents, we look at them from the perspective of the existing economics design framework: Market Design, Mechanism Design and Token Design. The market design is the economy’s parameters, typically defined by the game developer, and by extension, game designer (aesthetic and economy design). Mechanism design

is the rules for economic participation in the game’s world. These determine both the gameplay and rules of how these agents interact with each other. Token design is the value creation when users interact in the game world.

The reason for having these personas is that they help to scope out the right economic policies in each unique game economy. As the underlying game is different, the economic policies can also differ greatly.

 

## 1) Players

Players are the core value creator in the game universe. The way the market can be created will affect the players entering. For instance, a Free to Play vs Pay to Play model. That can greatly affect the number of players, thus the thickness of the market.

The development for the game is also important as players do not just take on a single role. They can also take on the role of builders, and the open vs closed-source development can impact how market thickness is bootstrapped.

Depending on the level of ideal decentralisation, the players can also take on leadership and governance roles. Having such a plan in the roadmap can help in the ideation of the native governance token’s monetary policy.

If decentralisation is the goal, the interactions between agent types will be something to think about when designing the economic policies and token economics. After all, the token model emphasises the policies for these agents.

Understanding the player types help to have a better sense of the player behaviours. For instance, certain promotions might encourage adverse selection of bots and players, as opposed to real players, focusing on game play and value creation. That can definitely affect the effectiveness of increasing market size of the game.

In the context of mechanism design, traditional gameplay is of essence to players. The various incentive loops, pay to win and game scope enhance how fun the game is played, which helps in value creation by the players.

Lastly, in a Play to Earn model that we see in blockchain, tokens play a new and important role in the economy. Considerations like potential earnings in dollars, inflation rates, tradeoffs for late entrants and revenue share are important considerations of the player in any game.

## 2) Builders

Builders are a specific type of player in the game. Whilst they are not core infrastructure developers, they help to build the world, which then facilitates the game world for players. It is possible for one to be both a player and builder.

When building the game universe, assets and infrastructure, the builder considers the market at large. Such as the demographic reach, the in-game vs off-game activity, white-label vs license model and connectivity to off-game blocks and use-cases. This

increases the utility of infrastructure built, which increases the value creation multiplier to the builder.

For the mechanism design, this means the ability to leverage development of the main game to build new infrastructure. And to do that, it is important to be mindful of the rules of interaction.

In token design, there needs to be value recognition for external parties. This value is realised by holding the tokens, hence it becomes a consideration when designing the monetary policy of the token.

## 3) Developers

As the core game developer, the market is not just players, but also potential partners and different types of players in the game. This increases thickness and also increases the type of users. A diversification of user-types helps to build a more antifragile, potentially countercyclical, system.

Mechanism design will be core principles for developers. That includes the resources supply regulation, DAO functions to update rules of the game and the balance between having the entire game’s economic policy designed by the developer or to allow for new rules to be created by the community.

In terms of monetary policy, the developer has to balance between the token monetary policy, utility of various token types and most importantly, the relationship among different tokens, and players, to help with value creation.

## 4) Investors

Investors take a different approach to market design. Looking internally, that is the various metrics to understand market growth, to look at long-term performance. Externally, that is the ability to cross various metaverses and grow the network effects.

On the mechanism design side, depending on the type of investors, some play the game, so they hold the player persona; in-game mechanisms considerations are similarly applied. For non-players, that is the rules around collectibles, economy, passive value accrual and long-term sustainability of the resources and tokens in the game.

Token design considerations for investors are both micro in terms of using the native tokens for game expansion and addition, as well as macro in terms of value capture by the token and real value realisation in the game.

## 5) NFT Collectors

NFT collector is a new persona in the gaming and metaverse space. There are virtual game collectors in traditional games, but trading happens in the black market, which incurs a middlemen fee to the players. In addition, the risk of trading in the black market7 includes not receiving the assets, receiving counterfeit assets and receiving illegally stolen assets that are not usable in the game. As NFT is publicly traded, this allows for

a new paradigm of market to exist. This includes visibility of NFT collection, notoriety of overall project and long-term attractiveness of the NFT within the game market and external metaverse market.

The utility and contribution of the NFT asset in the game and its subsequent mechanism design becomes crucial to NFT collectors. Beyond that, the risks, business rationale

of the game and relationship between assert owners and governance also play an important role in the mechanism considerations for NFT collectors.

Lastly, as with NFTs, the supply and inflation nature of the asset, together with the rarity and revenue generation profile become the key incentive for NFT collectors in the space.

All in all, these are the 5 core persona types and their subsequent considerations in the economics design framework. This builds the core building block for economists to design the right incentives for the game.","self","https://redd.it/smbdxx"

A pool for a token A and a stable coin B, both valued at $1. I put $1000 each and set the range at $0.9 \~ $1.1.

If I remove 100%, I get 4.55 token A ($5) and 2095 stable coin B ($2095)

Is this the same as deposing 995.45 (1000 - 4.55) token A, which was worth $995.45, for $1095 ( ($2095 - $1000)? So the capital gain is $1095 - $995.45 = $99.55?

**TLDR**:

As markets evolve, the economics governing the markets also evolve. Markets evolve due to technological advancements and new types of resources creation. Intangible resources are a new resource in the space today. Supported by technological advancements, these developments have reshaped the way we understand how markets work and can be designed.

**Get smart:** Technology has changed the way economic principles are being applied. The good news is that fundamental economic principles do not change. We just have a new resource to play with now.

# General Conclusion

Traditionally, economics is the study of how resources are produced, consumed and distributed in a market. Resources are input factors to produce goods or services for commerce. They are factors of production. There are four main resources: labour, land, capital and entrepreneurship.

Economics is a “soft science” like psychology, political science and sociology, compared to a “hard science” like physics, biology and astronomy. As our ecosystems evolve due to technological upgrades and increased complexity of human behaviours, the analysis and objectivity in economics evolves with resource evolution.

The advent of new economic resources like information as a resource, and technology allowing for interaction between agents, has resulted in new economic fields. Many of the recent Nobel prizes were awarded in recognition of new economic approaches. For example, auction theory (2020), integrating technological innovations into long-run macroeconomic analysis (2018), nudge theory and choice architecture (2017), contract theory (2016), two-sided markets (2014), and market design (2012).

# New Economic Resource: Intangible assets

The four traditional economic resources are land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship. These are traditional tangible resources.

In today’s digital ecosystems, a new resource has come into the picture: information (intangible resource).

# 4 Properties of this new resource

**Sunk costs:** these are costs that have already been paid for and consumed.

Spill-overs:

these are additional effects that can be both positive and negative. This is determined by the secondary impacts and implications related to the intangible assets created.

Scalability:

this is the ability to expand growth easily. The key feature in an intangible asset is that it has a non-rivalry characteristic. One person’s usage does not reduce the existence of the asset. The asset is also supercharged with “network effects”, a positive spill-over.

Two people in two cities can read the same article online at the same time. This is different to an article in a newspaper, where only one person at a time can read the newspaper because they are each in different physical places.

**Synergies and complementarities:** these are intangible assets that can produce synergies and complementarities with other assets, enhancing network effects. This helps networks to scale and produce positive spill-over effects, as opposed to substitutability.","self","https://redd.it/sn1qnp"

This is not financial advice.  **TLDR**:In terms of the DEX market, protocols are increasingly developing new functions for more efficient use of funds. Examples are Bancor V2, Uniswap V3 and DODO, which we have discussed.As for DODO, this protocol has provided a new solution with the ability to adapt to market fluctuations. However, with large fluctuations, the model is still likely to encounter the problems discussed.DeFi continues to be a place to test innovations, and today we are still making changes to make the financial system better. However, not all initiatives are successful and we need more time to do more experiments.

# General Conclusion

In the summer of DeFi 2020 decentralised exchanges exploded, especially AMM, with the success of Uniswap. Since then, a series of projects have copied Uniswap's model, but some have approached the problem in a different direction. Including DODO.Launched in mid-August 2020, DODO is an on-chain liquidity solution that combines AMM and oracle. This is also a factor that is more advanced than other DEXs like Uniswap.

# Dex Market

AMM-based DEXs have proven to be one of the highest impact DeFi innovations, allowing investors to seamlessly trade between cryptocurrencies in a completely decentralised and unattended manner, through pre-funded on-chain liquidity pools.**How:** simply **deposit capital into these liquidity pools** (become a market maker).**Why:** liquidity providers can **earn a passive income** on their capital through accrued **trading fees**, based on their contribution rate.The DEX has had unprecedented success over the past few months. Led by Uniswap, DEX volume surged to a record high of $83 billion in May, and the total locked-in value on all DEX platforms also reached the highest value of almost $28 billion. 

## Problems

Despite such tremendous success, AMM DEXs still face their own limitations. Some inherent problems are:

1. Impermanent loss (IL)
2. Capital efficiency
3. Slippage
4. Gas costs
5. Speed
6. Multi-token exposure
7. Front-running
8. Back-running

The most important risk is **IL**, which is quantified by the **difference** in portfolio **value** over time between providing **liquidity to the DEX poolversusbuying and holding** the underlying tokens.

>IL = token in DEX — hodl token

It happens because AMM prices do not automatically adjust. When prices across the market change, arbitrageurs enter and profit at the expense of liquidity providers. So, the actual profit of LP in AMM pools is the balance between the accumulated fees from the trades and the impermanent loss caused by the arbitrage. During implementation, AMMs encountered capital inefficiencies, poor liquidity used, and exposure to multiple tokens. Since AMM allocates capital equally across the price range (0; +∞), only funds allocated close to the market price are effectively utilised with a significant portion of the funds available only when the valuation curve begins to fall and the head turns exponentially.As a result, AMMs require greater amounts of liquidity to accommodate the slippage on traditional order-to-order exchanges. Furthermore, AMM often requires the LP to deposit two or more tokens to provide liquidity, forcing exposure to additional assets.AMM is often referred to as ""lazy liquidity"" because of the uncontrollable price point offered to traders, unlike traditional market makers.","self","https://redd.it/sny22b"

With Digital healthcare becoming more mainstream IAMVAX will represent the more modern  communities as well as people of all economic status and allow them to participate in the growing earning potential of crypto at the same time. 

   The IAMVAX Token is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain with a total initial supply of 2.000.000.000 tokens, of which more than 30% was already burned and Tokenomics declined accordingly. Liquidity is locked for 6 months. 10% Marketing Budget. 10% Support Fund. 10% Partnership and Development Fund for NFT projects as Roadmap indicates. 

   According to the project team, IAMVAX will target a 100M market capitalization by Q4. This appears to be very realistic in consideration that all population is currently affected by the Global Health situation in one way or the other and crypto has had acceptance throughout all areas of the worldwide population. As well, the support Fund, the NFT project and the fact that presale sold out quickly are clear indicators of major success for IAMVAX. 

   Taking the actual spending as well as earning potential in all aspects of today’s Global Health situation, IAMVAX could become a realistic smart and less expensive option for  paying for services or products in regards to the health care systems.

This is not financial advice. **TLDR**:Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds. Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

# Decentralised Bond

## Definition

By definition, it is clear that decentralised bond has the same meaning as traditional bond. Some of the differences include the time to maturity, the yield, and the ability to combine to create many different products and serve different purposes.","self","https://redd.it/sonwx0"

This is not financial advice. **TLDR**:As a debt protocol, Liquity's goal is naturally to expand the demand for $LUSD. When the demand for $LUSD increases, the protocol revenue earned from mint and redeem activities will also be larger.$LUSD is an over-collateralised stablecoin with a minimum collateralised ratio of 110%, but the actual collateralisation of the system is around 250%. Liquity is one of a number of recent prominent lending projects. After more than 2 months of development, the project has achieved many notable achievements. $LUSD is currently the 8th largest market capitalisation stablecoin according to Coingecko's statistics. However, $LUSD's DeFi integrations and use cases are very limited.

# General Conclusion

Liquity is a decentralised borrowing protocol similar to the Maker DAO. In the Liquity protocol, users lock collateral to open collateralised debt positions (CDPs, in Liquity called troves). The system then lends the user $LUSD from the system - a stablecoin pegged to $1.The two main and essential components of the project are $LUSD — stablecoin and $LQTY — revenue token:

* $LUSD is a stablecoin that is collateralised only by $ETH and is kept stable at peg 1 $LUSD = 1 $USD.
* Liquity ($LQTY) is the project's utility token, only used for staking and earning protocol revenue generated during borrowing and redeeming $LUSD.

# Classifying Stablecoins

We look at them in four different ways:

1. Mechanism
2. Peg
3. Collateral amount
4. Collateral type

# About $LUSD

It uses two mechanisms, a dual-token and a reserve. It's soft pegged to USD and the collateral amount is over-collateralised. It uses just $ETH as collateral type.

# Dual-Token Model

There are two tokens in the system, $LUSD, which is a stablecoin soft pegged to USD and the other one is $LQTY which is not a governance token but purely a value accrual token. When we talk about value accrual there is a liquidation fee that is generated from the system. The $LQTY holders will be receiving this liquidation fee which is the profits from the system. You hold $LUSD when you want to be using it, creating it, and paying people in it and you hold $LQTY when you want to receive accrual from the system.

# Reserves

Reserves are over-collateralised. Ideally, it is 150% over-collateralised, but the entire system is 200% over-collateralised. The lower bound or the lowest amount that can be over-collateralised is 110% and below that you'll be liquidated. It uses $ETH as collateral.","self","https://redd.it/spghur"

**TLDR**:

When discussing about ""Ethereum killer"", it is not just about fighting the layer 1 tech infrastructure. The truth is that there are risks that needs to be mitigated in this infrastructure. In fact, the attack by flashbots is much higher than 51% attack. Thus, this remains as a real risk in the Ethereum network.

# General Conclusion

In an emerging environment like Layer 1 blockchain, it is not uncommon to have competitors. For instance, there are many projects calling themselves ""Ethereum killers"". There is an argument to be made against monopolies in the L1 infrastructure, but it is also about solving different vulnerabilities in Ethereum itself.

## What are the Vulnerabilities?

>Arbitrage bots front-running the transactions.

**What?** I tell the Ethereum network that I want to make a transaction. i.e. buying 100 ETH on Uniswap. This action will take some time to confirm. During this period, it goes into this pool called Mempool. There, everyone can see that ""hey, Lisa is going to buy 100 ETH. It is not executed yet.""

**The risk?** Because this is public, bots can come in to pre-trade. They are called flashbots. The basically front-run your trade. They execute the trade before you.

**How?** By paying more fees to prioritise their transactions before yours.

# What Is Flashbot?

Bots or network robots are software applications that run automated tasks on the network. Typically, bots perform simple tasks and have a repetitive structure at a much higher frequency than humans can manage. They automatically find, analyse and organise information from web servers at speeds much higher than human speed.

Flashbots are like bots, but built with smart contracts (specifically, Ethereum Blockchain) to perform profitable and fast transactions without going through a human. They are also pre-programmed to repeat preset actions over and over.

# Inside The Dark Forest (Mempool) And Hunters (Flashbots)

>In the mempool, it's all dark and murky. The flashbots can find the trade and execute before you. And they win.

Dark Forest is an environment in which there are dangerous hunters, and if you are caught, death is likely. A job as a person's position is hunting us. (This is also the concept that inspired the [Dark Forest game](https://zkga.me/) on Ethereum testnet.)

In Mempool, these clever predators take the form of ""arbitrage bots"". They keep track of pending transactions and try to exploit the profitable opportunities they create.

The one who understands Flashbots best is smart contract researcher Phil Daian, who along with colleagues wrote [Flash Boys 2.0 article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf) and came up with the term ""Miner Extractable Value"" (MEV).

>How? Flashbots look for any transaction that they can profitably front-run by copying it and replacing the address with its own address.

Phil once talked about a ""Generalised Frontrunner"" flashbot that looks for transactions in Mempool (such as DEX transactions or Oracle update) and tries to pre-run them according to a predefined algorithm. **Flashbots look for any transaction that they can profitably front-run by copying it and replacing the address with its own address.** They can also execute transactions and copy beneficial internal transactions generated by its execution trace.","self","https://redd.it/sqf1oi"

In summary, Hermes DeFi is requesting an Additional Use grant from Uniswap to deploy Uniswap V3 based smart contracts to power a new AMM/DEX on the Harmony blockchain.

In exchange for this permission, the Uniswap DAO will receive:

1. A 10% allocation of HERMES tokens
2. 25% of platform trading fees, returned as IRIS (decreasing 5% each year for the next 5 years)
3. 50% of platform trading fees for the IRIS/1UNI pair, which will have a dedicated farm for the foreseeable future.
4. 2% of IRIS supply (governance token of Hermes).

This is not financial advice. **TLDR**:Ampleforth is fascinating because it has the potential to become the global base money of the future. This is done by having governance in code, and it internalises any currency volatility to produce countercylical pressures with its monetary policy.**Get smart:** This is unlike the current global currency (USD) that we have, so this model has a potential to succeed.**Get smarter:** The problem is arguably how the distribution of tokens are with certain key stakeholders. Could affect token holders in the long-run.

# General Conclusion

Ampleforth is very interesting because it could definitely become a global base currency moving forward. Instead of USD, imagine a currency that is used by everyone in the world to trade. Instead of having the world currency (USD) being tied to the internal politics of US, this new currency is neutral and changes its monetary supply based on the global demand of money.In this episode, we will uncover the design of Ampleforth works, the economic considerations and how it plays a role in the DeFi space.

# 1. What is Ampleforth (AMPL)

* Ampleforth wants to be a token with a stable value.
* **How?** They do this with an automated governance using code, by internalising the price volatility in the secondary market.
* **Explain more?** The code is 2 math functions. (1) It calculates the price difference between the ""ideal price"" USD$1 and the actual exchange rate now (e.g. US$1.15). Then it mints more tokens, so that the price goes back down to US$1. (2) It doesn't do this suddenly, token changes happen over a period of 10 days. We call this supply smoothing.
* **So what's cool about it?** It can be used as collaterals in the DeFi projects. It's also not strictly pegged to a fiat currency (e.g. DAI with USD), so it makes it more independent and useful in the long run. Basically, Ampleforth is the new global currency without central bank.
* **Can I earn money with AMPL?** It is possible. For example, doing arbitrage trading with price differences, because you know that prices will always go back to US$1.

# 2. AMPL vs AAVE, COMP, USD

* You can't compare AMPL with AAVE or COMP.  
* because they have different token functions.
* AMPL has a money function and AAVE or COMP has a utility function. It's like comparing USD with American Airlines miles system. It's similar, but not the same.
* But you **can** compare AMPL with USD.  
* because they both have money functions.
* AMPL has an independent monetary policy while USD clearly does not.
* USD is governed by the central bank (aka FED). It's a bunch of smart people in a room, deciding how much money should be available in the economy, the interest rates, the lending rates, etc.
* AMPL is governed by code instead.
* **Is that good or bad?** It really depends. It's good because economists are always looking for solutions to get an independent neutral money, used by everyone. We call this the Triffin Dilemma. However, because it is **only** governed by code, it's possible to affect the secondary market in a short period, if you have enough tokens to manipulate the code.

# 3. Economics Design of Ampleforth

* **Market Design** 
* To increase network effects and demand for AMPL, there are 2 systems in place  
* increase the use of AMPL as collaterals for DeFi projects
* use of Geyser program for people to stake their tokens
* To reduce insane fluctuation in prices, a supply smoothing function is applied, so the change in token quantity is done over a period of 10 days.
* To become more politically independent and to tap onto the benefits of a digital network, the information (prices, volatility, decision making) is done by oracles and machines.
* **Mechanism Design** 
* Math is used to define the rules of the game, for the system to abide by
* When prices change, it affects the amount of tokens available. This directly affects the number of tokens you have in your wallet.  
* **Get smart:** this is where most people don't understand the system. They think that AMPL is a scam. Because tokens can be removed. See below (5. Valuation of Ampleforth) for further explanation.
* Oracles are used to take in prices (via exchange rates of AMPL) and internalise that information.  
* **How**? It changes the amount of of AMPL supply, in response to the prices.
* If prices are too high: print more AMPL
* If prices are too low: burn some AMPL
* **Token Design** 
* Instead of [chartallist](https://youtu.be/1suLcHUHcDU) money like USD, AMPL is metallist money (aka commodity money, like gold). But we call it synthetic or digital metallist money.  
* Machines (math mentioned in #3) define the monetary policy
* Uses Countercyclical approach (see points above on when it prints or burns AMPL)
* Reduce economic fluctuations (see mechanism design above, on internalising price differences and changing supply, so value of 1 AMPL is about US$1)
* AMPL's value is allowed to fluctuate between ±5% of US$1\*  
* this US$1 is pegged to the economic definition of ""Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the 2019 dollar""
* Supply smooth is used so that we prevent supply side inflation (or shocks). So if there is an increase in tokens by 15%, the increase will happen over 10 days. Each day will increase by 1.5% instead.
* It's also interesting because it has low correlation to Crypto-assets price fluctuations.  
* **Get smart**: this is great for being part of the portfolio
* Big VCs own a significant percentage of AMPL tokens that is vest  
* **Get smart**: this can be dangerous when the vesting period is over and they dump it in the market

# 4. Monetary Policy

There are 3 situations in the monetary policy:

>Graphs and explanations are in the video.

* expansionary  
* Prices will remain the same in the long-run
* But supply will increase
* Market cap will increase in the long-run
* contractionary  
* Prices will remain the same in the long-run
* But supply will decrease
* Market cap will decrease in the long-run

Combine all these 3 states together, so you can visualise what the general shape of the supply and price and market cap looks like.","self","https://redd.it/sr56i8"

IAMVAX token is the initiative that finds it’s unique niche and opportunity in combining the two top trending topics worldwide; GLOBAL HEALTH and CRYPTO.

Through our initiative and with a touch of the NFT world being part of our plan, we have become the pioneer in combining blockchain technology and the current movement surrounding \*Global Health\*. With Digital healthcare becoming more mainstream IAMVAX will represent the more modern communities as well as people of all economic status and allow them to participate in the growing earning potential of crypto at the same time.

The IAMVAX Token is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain with a total initial supply of 2.000.000.000 tokens, of which more than 30% was already burned and Tokenomics declined accordingly. Liquidity is locked for 6 months. 10% Marketing Budget. 10% Support Fund. 10% Partnership and Development Fund for NFT projects as Roadmap indicates.

According to the project team, IAMVAX will target a 100M market capitalization by Q4. This appears to be very realistic in consideration that all population is currently affected by the Global Health situation in one way or the other and crypto has had acceptance throughout all areas of the worldwide population. As well, the support Fund, the NFT project and the fact that presale sold out quickly are clear indicators of major success for IAMVAX.

Taking the actual spending as well as earning potential in all aspects of today’s Global Health situation, IAMVAX could become a realistic smart and less expensive option for paying for services or products in regards to the health care systems.

 **TLDR:**MakerDAO is a novel and innovative protocol that allows for on-chain collateralised borrowing, while also creating a reasonably effective stablecoin. This gives the crypto community an alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins like $USDT. Furthermore, $MKR holders continue to make continual improvements to the protocol, so it is very likely that the risks we have outlined could largely be mitigated in the future.

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# Stablecoin Classification

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

>Check the previous newsletter if you want more clarity.

1. Mechanisms
2. Peg
3. Collateral Amount
4. Collateral Type

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO’s ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced.","self","https://redd.it/sruk5y"

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR and APY becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.

# General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

>Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

>What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.","self","https://redd.it/sslmmy"

1.  Regarding volume and liquidity of an LP.  If a pool is really small, for example, $2,000 of assets and $1,500 in volume, and you own matching assets that you want to stay long - why would you invest in this LP?  If fees are driven off of volume and pool size, aren't you capped to a small fee share?  Or is it that has price goes up, the volume and liquidity value of the pool go up?  I will paste the pool as I just want to understand size limitations.  This pool is so small I would be funding 3x the assets and that seems a waste of capital?

2.   I like to look at APY vision.  [https://app.apy.vision/pools/uniswap\_eth-CEEK-WETH-pool-0x782a3e2ac6af3f592b2e8e1e37f54f99bcf202ad](https://app.apy.vision/pools/uniswap_eth-CEEK-WETH-pool-0x782a3e2ac6af3f592b2e8e1e37f54f99bcf202ad)

 My question is, don't advertised APYs for LPs matter less than advertised APYs for farms?  Farm APYs can shift with changes from the protocol but when I look at Vision, it's nice to see historical APYs but the only thing that matters is today and > / going forward.  Past APYs may be a good proxy, but looking at an LP APY and trying to project forward returns is seen as? ..... impossible / guesswork?

Net APY since inception, +200%.  Trailing APY, +85%.  Does is matter?  W/ the following assumptions, and I am likely thinking about this incorrectly,  assuming $5,000 and existing $2,132 pool = (5,000 / (5,000+2,132) x (vol 1,201 x 0.3%) = $3.6/day or $900 for the year?  On $5,000?  seems I am missing a step or have to project growth value of volume and pool?  How do the models like APY account for this?

This is not financial advice. StableCredit is a new protocol for decentralised lending, stablecoins and AMM. Introduced about 30 hours ago, this new product is both fascinating and confusing. Adam from Interaxis suggested that I explain it and hence, here’s your additional weekend read.Never a quiet day in defi, isn’t it!

>This is an Explain-like-I’m-High School version. I’m also going to reference to other DeFi projects in the space, so you can make the links. Indeed, it’s all just lego blocks stacking on to each other and building skyscrapers.

# YFI Project

📷If you have not heard about Yearn yet, it’s the hottest project so far. I’m due to make a video about YFI in the next few weeks. Hard to keep up with all the fun experiments and protocols going on!

# StableCredit combines the Lego of 4 DeFi protocols

If I can sum it up, it is combining 4 existing projects together:1) Using [u/MakerDAO](https://www.reddit.com/user/MakerDAO)'s model of multi-collateral in the system, instead of just single asset collateral. You can put whatever asset you want as collaterals.2) Using [u/AaveAave](https://www.reddit.com/user/AaveAave)'s lending protocol so you can borrow up to 75% of the collaterals you provided (see 1 above)3) How does the INTERNAL economy work then? It uses a single-sided AMM to mint the tokens. Confused? Think of it as [u/Bancor](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bancor) but BNT (the native token of Bancor) is not traded in the secondary market. So you reduce exposure for fluctuation.3.5) Now, [u/iearnfinance](https://www.reddit.com/user/iearnfinance) goes a little further and say, ""ok we don't want this new native token to be traded in the secondary market. Bc volatility sucks. So what can we do?"" Simple. We make that new native token a stable token with a pegged value. Which brings us to (4)4) Lastly, it uses [u/AmpleforthOrg](https://www.reddit.com/user/AmpleforthOrg)'s model of tapping into secondary market for traders to do arbitrage to get the pegged value back to its ideal state. Why would they do that? Bc traders get to make money. Duh.Win-win-win.

# What’s the Point of This…..?

You’re probably thinking, what’s the point. Creating ANOTHER token. Creating ANOTHER stable/pegged token. Why all the trouble when you have these lego blocks out there? Just use them if you need, right?Wrong.Here’s why:

## Impermanent Loss

Another point on the stable asset in the single-sided AMM: this helps to reduce (remove, maybe? I can't justify if it removes it for real) impermanent loss when trading.Combine (3) and (4), you realise that the asset will move quite a bit right? And when that happens, you have this thing called impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is a bad thing. Bad for asset holders in the AMM, can be bad for traders. So reduce this by reducing vol.

## What this asset does

Now, question. What does that.... stable asset do then?Simple.(A) you get to collect the collaterals in the AMM(B) you get to use it in the defi system bc it's pegged and has value. E.g. use it to borrow assets in Yearn.

## Application to Yield Farming?

And, how does it apply to yield farming? Because this information and system has no economic value if people don't use it, right?(A) Use that new stable asset to be doing your whatever farming field. Like a fertiliser.(B) Reduces vol with the stability, so easy to cal returnsIf you want to nerd out more, here’s the video explaining the math behind Bonding Curve Algorithms in Autonomous Market Makers in the space!","self","https://redd.it/stjn13"

Many people would go around saying that this is unsafe, but for me, it's not. According to my observation, if bitcoin moons, 90% of all other coins moons, and if bitcoin crashes, 90% of all other coins crash. The prices of most cryptocurrencies seem to be pretty correlated to each other, so I conducted my experiment: what if I open an ultra-concentrated liquidity position? I set the min price to 2.7% below market price, and the max price to 2.7% above market price. Hours later and it's still a very balanced liquidity position.

Most users believe that if they want to make profits they should put their liquidity in pools with stablecoins and conventional cryptocurrencies, since those have the most volume. In reality, pools between stablecoins, and pools between conventional cryptocurrencies have the lowest impermanent loss when compared to pools between conventional cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Remember how the whole market goes up when bitcoin goes up? Outliers who go against the market are extremely rare. My strategy combines the pros of hodling and providing liquidity.

This is not financial advice. 

**TLDR**:In the Depreciating License, Anthony and Glen come up with a simple game theory model of property ownership. Basically, you own a fixed percentage of the asset and the remaining percentage is auctioned or sold every time period. In this way, it combines both a full ownership model and a full rental model.This is quite attractive because in allocating property rights, we often experience a trade-off between incentive investment (100% equity ownership) and asset allocation (allocating to the best at the time of allocating). The amortization license model combines the two and balances the trade-off.

# General Conclusion

Today we will discuss property rights from real life to NFT space with Anthony Lee Zhang. He co-authored a paper with Glen Weyl on Depreciating Licenses (DL). We will go from existing problems with property rights in the physical world to the digital world and how the world is changing to bring more rights and fairness to everyone.In this discussion, we will refer to DL model including Privatisation, Holdout and Allocation. Next will be the trade-offs of allocation for investment in the short and long term. Finally, we will discuss governance in DL, game theory for DL model and applications in NFT.

# Assistant Professor of Finance UChicago Booth, Anthony Zhang

If I could teleport back to two years ago I would tell myself to watch out for this paper. It is exactly what I was looking for back then. Property rights and tokenising property rights as well as finding more efficient ways to be embedded within property rights for efficient allocation is beautiful. We can do that now! Anthony discusses his research paper on property rights.

## About Anthony Zhang

**Anthony:** I'm Anthony Zhang, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth. I mainly work in financial market intermediation and market design. I analyse questions about **how we can analyse financial markets, figure out how efficient they are and how we can make them work better**. Some of the more classical markets that I study are the Banking industry, Housing markets, and Derivative markets.This is an earlier paper actually which I've recently revised. We mainly were aiming this paper at analysing questions of natural resource license design but there seems to be an application in the crypto space too. I think the paper predates the NFT boom. When we were seeing all this NFT action going on, we realised that some of the ideas here might also apply to the NFT space, so this is where I’m coming from.

# Introduction to Depreciating Licenses Model

The way we often motivate this is that the government has a bunch of natural resources. This can be **land but also things like radio spectrum, oil drilling rights, fishing rights**, etc. All these things are **sources of things that somebody can generate a value** from like fishing, building radio towers and selling 5G spectrum. The government wants to decide who should get access to use these resources, and they want to raise revenue from the use of these resources. Privatisation has been the classic way to do this since the Chicago Free Market Revolution.

>Property rights in: land but also things like radio spectrum, oil drilling rights, fishing rights Generate a value: like fishing, building radio towers and selling 5G spectrum.

### Privatisation

Before this privatisation boom, the government would take these licenses and give them to the best user. This **did not work so well** because normally the **government** is **constrained** regarding how much information it can gain about **who will be the most efficient user**. **Hence, the government decided to privatise** and auction off these licenses based on the assumption that the highest bidder for a license would be the best user of the asset. This started happening from the 90s onwards.

### Holdout

Privatisation works fairly well but it generates distortions. One of the biggest **distortions is that it generates holdouts** — when the government sells a spectrum license or a land-use license, that allocation is often efficient at the time it first sells the license. But 20 years later the same company is stuck with the license and much more efficient companies have come in and they want the license but the old company basically holds onto the license and waits to sell it at the highest price possible.

### Allocation

Pure privatisation does not work perfectly. What we noticed is that there is a way to do slightly better than privatisation in terms of allocating resources efficiently. Resource license design affects the efficiency of use of these resources. Pure privatisation selling really long-term use rights gives buyers security in their assets and gives them incentives to invest.

**TLDR**:

While inflation should theoretically reduce the value of a particular asset, in a strong bull market, enough demand can still outweigh the selling pressure from inflation.

You can clearly see this in the inflation chart (monthly) of Sushiswap. Despite the huge inflation in the early stages to incentivise users, the value of $SUSHI is increasing rapidly. This is something interesting in the crypto space.

# General Conclusion

Inflation is not only an important variable in monetary policy in the economy, but also important in crypto. Inflation is the easiest way to fund development. This forces holders to indirectly pay for development through the loss of value or ownership of the token over time to the protocol.

Inflation is usually referred to via a token release schedule; the researcher actively recalculates it.

# What Is Inflation?

>Inflation in traditional economics refers to the **increase in prices of goods.** Inflation in token economics refers to the **increase in token supply.**

Inflation is the persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services over time and the value loss of a currency. When the general price level rises, **a unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than in the past.** Thus, inflation reflects a decrease in purchasing power per unit of a currency. In the economy, inflation is affected by many factors such as **demand-pull, cost-push, structural changes and import and export, etc.**

In the crypto space, inflation is the issuing of new crypto/tokens into circulation which puts selling pressure on them. In theory, their value should decrease with an increase in supply, if demand is constant. Inflation in the crypto space is mainly affected by **the increase in the supply of circulating tokens**.

# Token Issuance Model

The only impact on inflation is the issuance of tokens into circulation. Token inflation is used to bootstrap growth or to start a community. In this section we are going to find the answer to this question: which issuance models have been used so far in crypto space?

* Algo Supply
* Scheduled Supply

I got the hint that to increase stability, efficiency in pools swap and of course, fees would only be capable if there was no auto-compound and you had to harvest your own words pro-actively.

I did some basic math and was wondering if the utility and economic benefit of v3 will offset the losses from not being able to harvest your trades daily due to gas costs.

If you receive a 40% APR on a $5,000 investment, you'll make $2,000 w/o compounding and assuming your (r) holds.  If you were compounding daily, you would return an APY% of 49.15 and earn an additional $457 on your trade.  Assume all of it gets reinvested.

If you took a modest gas fee of $25,  (mine 1hr ago EST) in v3 to harvest $5.40 was $70.00, you would lose your entire profit by the \~18th time you selected to compound during the year.

However, when I go to execute the swap, and the smart contact call comes up in TrustWallet, it’ll go from telling me that the network fee is over $150, despite the last page saying the network fee would be the $21.97.

I understand that the gas fee fluctuates by the second, but it doesn’t seem to be going any higher than the mid $30-range, and I’ve been unable to find any straight answers on what the difference, if any, is between gas and network fees.

**TLDR**: Strategies are presented here to create basic positions from which you can explore other new strategies. As mentioned, options strategies allow the creation of positions with the risk aversion level from the investor's demands. Using the strategy as a hedge, it is necessary to consider whether your position is suitable or not.

**Get smarter:** Not any asset has options based on it. However, we can design our own to make contracts that closely resembles an asset we hold with another asset. Of course, the complexity and number of transactions also increase, they reduce profit by cost.

# General Conclusion

One of the most attractive feature of options is that it can be a combination of options or combined with other derivatives to create a variety of strategies. The possibilities for profit can be so varied that almost any investor can find a strategy that meets their preferred level of risk and is in line with the market forecast.

Without options, the strategies are very limited. If the assets are expected to increase, people would buy the stocks; if they are expected to decrease, people would sell them. Choice makes the move from forecasting to a profitable action plan, if the forecast is correct. Of course, the strategy will punish you for incorrect prediction. However, with the correct use of options, the punishment will be quite small and predictable.

In this newsletter, we will introduce some simple option strategies that you can apply easily. These strategies are the easiest to understand and require the least transaction.

# Covered Call Option strategy

>**TLDR:** I have $ETH. I sell options for $ETH so people can buy $ETH when prices increase. I get money upfront. I lose the infinite upside.

## Who will use this strategy?

### Own Asset

You have people who own the asset, say $ETH. In crypto space, we have two types of people. The first type is people who just have $ETH as an investment and keep it in their wallets. I'm looking at you, institutional investors.

The second type is people who are liquidity providers to protocols like HEGIC, OPYN.

### Sell Call Option

For people who are liquidity providers, this is where you will be selling a call option.

Crash course: call option is basically the ability for someone else to buy your ETH. You're selling the possibility for someone to buy this asset (ETH) from you at a different price.

### Example

Let's say ETH right now is worth $1800 and you want to sell this call option. The strike price is $1950 and they have to pay a premium of $100. Let's say ETH becomes $2200.

Because someone bought the call option from you, they can go to you and buy at $1950 because you've already made a promise. The benefit for you is that you received this $100 premium no matter what. This premium is why people want to be option sellers as they get to earn some money.

### How does this strategy help to manage risk?

This is money upfront whether ETH goes to $2200 or ETH drops to $1000. Whatever happens to ETH doesn't matter because I have this $100 upfront.

 FEI protocol had all of twitter talking last week. Backed by significant VCs, this new algorithmic stablecoin mechanism, $FEI, managed to raise US$1 billion worth of Ether within the first 24 hours. And within 24 hours of launch, the price of $FEI dropped significantly, as did $TRIBE, the governance token.So what went wrong? How did the economics model and incentive design fail so terribly? And what was the tipping point that caused this massive disaster? Today, we analyse the lessons to learn from $FEI, this new mechanism to create an algorithmic stablecoin.

>TLDR: FEI had great ideas in the pure engineering side of the mechanism design. But economics is not pure systems engineering. It includes human interaction, which can make or break an ecosystem. The human element is what separates engineering from economics.

Over the weekend (on Sunday), we had a community chat on Discord, discussing stablecoins. We touched on the topic of FEI protocol, since it was the topic of the week. It is a very interesting experiment that went south, so it's good to unpack what happened and learn from it.

# About FEI Protocol

Here's a quick summary of the FEI protocol, because you've probably read about it a zillion times.

* What is $FEI? A stablecoin pegged to $1, algorithmically. That means $FEI's economics is determined mathematically to get the $1 peg. The economics can be supply, withdrawal fee, minting fee, etc.
* What is $TRIBE? A governance token to adjust the parameters to change the mechanisms of $FEI.
* What is so special?  

1. Instead of using $ETH to create a token valued at $1, you sell your $ETH for $FEI.
2. The protocol owns part of the assets as part of governance to manage that $1 peg.
3. Direct incentives are used to reward and punish users in the system. If $FEI is below $1 and you sell it for $ETH, you have to pay a ""punishment fee"" and you get less than $1 worth of $ETH back. If you deposit $ETH to mint more $FEI when it is less than $1, you get more $FEI in return.

* How did it get so popular? It was backed by large VCs and strong personalities on Twitter.
* How much did it raise? 1.3 billion in $ETH, of which 1 billion was raised in 24h.
* What happened within 24h of it releasing? People wanted to get their $ETH back by returning $FEI. This caused massive sell pressure, and with the value of $FEI, with the incentive, dropped significantly. At one point it was less than $0.40 when it is meant to be pegged at $1. This was a 60% value loss.
* Why did people put money in, in the first place?

# Economics Mechanism of FEI Protocol

So let's dive into the economics mechanism analysis. We will never stray too far from economics fundamentals — supply, demand, willingness to buy/sell, incentives, punishments and behaviours.

## Mechanism Design of FEI Protocol

*Fundamentals: Incentives, Punishments, Supply/Demand*Mechanism design is the design of rules governing the system — participants and general token usability.**Free Alpha**With stablecoins, one needs to bootstrap the community since most of the value of stablecoins come from their usability. To bootstrap, $FEI is sold at a discount and capped at $1.01. If you enter the bonding early (e.g. $0.99), you get to profit from the difference between the price you purchased at and the market value, $1.**Free TRIBE**Even at $1.01, people are still purchasing $FEI for $ETH because they also receive $TRIBE. Since $FEI is technically priced at $1, and if you value $TRIBE more than $0.01, you are getting a deal by receiving $TRIBE.**Direct Incentives**The mechanism also has direct punishments for users. When prices are below $1 and you want to sell it, you have to pay a punishment fee. That is the difference in cents, squared. So if it is currently priced at 0.95, the difference is $0.05. And the punishment is $0.25. That means your $FEI is really worth $0.75.In this case, the value before punishment cannot be less than $0.90, since the squared difference is $1. That means at $0.90 per $FEI before punishment, you are selling $FEI for nothing in return.And this is important because it leads to the effects of a circular economy explained next. 

## Conclusion

Right now, the practical thing could be to sell $ETH and reimburse users who lost money. Ideally, the VCs backing the protocol can use their power and influence to do something good. But realistically, the truth is that the protocol needs to build faith and trust in the system again. The problem is that it is extremely challenging. Once trust and faith are broken, it is very difficult to restore them.Nonetheless, this is a great experiment. It brings in features of DeFi — bonding curve, quadratic fees and DEX liquidity mechanism. It is great to experiment by bringing them together. However, more analysis and modelling could have been done before launching the protocol.When launching projects in a bull market it is easy to receive liquidity and support. But do not force to test, test and test again. We're building the future. It's not just about design and builds. Test, test and test again.","self","https://redd.it/swqj7x"

**TLDR**:

This episode compares the example of Airbnb's market design with various recommendations on how you can design your token market. There is no ""one size fits all"" market design model, it all depends on the objective and behaviours you want to optimise in your ecosystem.

# General Conclusion

Market design is a field in economics that is relatively young. It is the **design of the environment**, which your participants (and tokens) exist in. Market design is a form of **microeconomic engineering** that combines science with art, using tools, concepts, models, theory and practical aspect of the real world.

We need market design because it affects **how** our digital (crypto) ecosystem will **evolve**, the **value add** to the users and **valuation** of your ecosystem.

# 1. Why A Need for Market Design

2 reasons:

1. Markets are not stable. Hence, they are **not efficient**. When they are not efficient, there are lots of issues, including market failure. Designing a market cross borders and geographical distance only enhances any market failures and efficiencies.
2. Markets exist to **promote certain outcomes**. We can achieve this with rules and different constraints to alter certain behaviours.

# 2. Why Study Market Design

1. **New digital markets.** Markets are no longer the traditional physical brick and mortar shops, where traditional economics hold. The cost structure like marginal costs, differs, hence the economics of these new markets. We have to design new economic models and systems for these new markets.
2. **Market failure**. Market failure is only enhanced when there are less constraints like jurisdictions. When creating our own economies, we are also designing these rules. Understanding why and how they fail will be crucial to our success.
3. To know what is **good design**. There is no ""holy grail"" of design, where it fits every objective. Hence, it is important to understand what is good design and apply these aspects to the ecosystems that we are building and designing.

# 3. Market Design in Token Economics

Why do we need market design in our token ecosystems? Because people are naturally uncooperative (think: game theory). With formal rules engineered, we can increase cooperation between participants.

For market design to work well, we need 3 ingredients: market thickness (think: network effects), low congestion and safe for participants to transact within your ecosystem.

# What Does this Mean

**Thickness** means things like increasing potential transactions available, increasing relevant offers, increasing time required for consideration and tap into network externalities.

To **reduce congestion**, allow for the right amount of options available, instead of limiting or overwhelming the users. Transaction throughput rates can also be adjusted either via the blockchain platform infrastructure or validator nodes on your ecosystem to achieve consensus.

**Safety** is another important aspect because if users are transacting **outside** of your ecosystem, the ecosystem does not capture value to the users and this **reduces valuation of your token ecosystem**. This can be in the code level of encryption and cryptography, to user level of privacy features, staking and transparency.","self","https://redd.it/sxfe9y"

Oil prices are expected to rise briefly, as in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea. However, as before, the issue will be resolved shortly after Saudi Arabia sells more in the market. Experts report a similar decline in gas prices. Qatar is known to have recently held talks with the EU about gas. Analysts predict that the price of Bitcoin will rise as the crisis deepens. The reason why this opinion is shared by many analysts is that the Bitcoin is easily transferable. Since the outflow of cash from countries is prohibited, especially in case of war, the advantage of Bitcoin and altcoins will emerge. It is thought that there will be more access to crypto markets. This goes hand in hand with the increase in the vulnerability of weak economies.

And another small question to see if I understood everything correctly. Let's say you provide liquidity for usdt/eth ranging from 2000 to 3000 usdt/eth.

It prompts 'waiting for confirmation' then goes right back to the confirm swap page.

I've noticed manually changing slippage to around 10-12% has helped people, but hasn't worked for me. Another common fix seems to be changing the last two digits of the token you're swapping to 99 or at least for it to not show 00.When it comes to changing the last two digits however, I have a maximum of 21,070,000 of this token. I put it to 21,069,999 but interestingly enough when the confirm swap pop-ups, it will automatically put the token amount back to 21,069,900. Why is it that the last two digits WON'T change to 99? Weirdly enough, if I delete the last two digits and input 210,699 the popup windows show the correct input of said number. It seems as soon as I add an extra digit after that, uniswap will automatically change it to a 0. 

Does anyone know how I can fix this? Thank you!

\*update\* I've tried swapping the token with the digits 210,699 but the swap still didn't go through, so I believe it's not much to do with the last two digits being 99.","self","https://redd.it/sxs4wu"

This is not financial advice. Economics like to assume that people are rational. Yet, humans are the most irrational being in the world. We have so many biases, assumptions and we are influenced so easily.Remember in EP 3, I mentioned that digital economics is a closed loop system. In this closed loop system, we get to engineer incentives towards the targeted desired outcome.How do we do this? Through behavioural economics. And this is the first underlying principle to manage an ecosystem. It takes into consideration the irrationality of people's behaviour.In this episode, we will dive into

1. What behavioural economics is
2. Why are we like that? Why are we so prone to influence?
3. How can we apply behavioural economics applied to token economics?

What is Behavioural EconomicsBehavioural economics is a specific field of economics research. It studies the effects of social norms and individual psychology on economics decisions. In classical economics, we assume that everyone is logical. In behavioural economics, we study why people are illogical and why they behave like that.For example, buying a 2 weeks worth of food during a pandemic is logical. But buying endless rolls of toilet paper?Some possible answers:“The thing about panic-buying is that it gives us a sense of control at a time when we’re lacking that,” says Deborah Small, a psychologist who studies consumer judgment and human decision-making at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. She adds that things get harried when “people hear that other people are buying something, and they say, ‘Oh, I need that too.’ And it just spirals to this level where we have none.”

* People compare and when everyone is doing it, they are more likely to do it too. It's the herd mentality.
* Some people don't know what they want until they see it in context. Everything is relative, and if there is relatively less toilet paper than say noodles and rice, the irrational side is more interested in toilet paper.
* To make people desire things, making that thing difficult to attain reduces the logical side. Toilet papers were literally out of stock, and attaining it is very difficult.

## 3 Themes

There are 3 themes to behavioural economics, heuristics, framing and market inefficiencies.**Heuristics**In Daniel Kahneman's book, thinking fast and slow, he introduced 2 thinking systems in our head. System 1 thinks fast. System 2 thinks slow. Humans are not only illogical, but we are also super lazy. You would rather watch more mindless Netflix than solve a very difficult mathematics problem.That's not all your fault, really. Our brains are lazy and we like to take shortcuts. We like to take the path of least resistance. We like the easy way. That's where System 1 comes in. System 1 learns from experience and it becomes a mental shortcut. Or a rule of thumb. You know how you can customise commands on Siri or Alexa? Same thing. Our brain does that. So we can conserve our energy when we need to think more.That's good right? Yeah, but no. We make 95% of our decisions with this shortcut tool, and the decisions does not consider other new information that is available.**Framing**The world is a very complicated place. Things are difficult to understand. How does internet work? How does emails work? What the hell is bitcoin? Why is the government doing what it is doing?Well, this is why we have anecdotes, stories and stereotypes. It is easier to understand complicated things when it is simplified. They also become a mental filter for us to rely on understanding.Think of Instagram filters. It is a set of fixed filters that is applied to our faces. But it doesn't always work! Sometimes, we end up with strange glitches. Our brains, being lazy, apply these filters. Sometimes, glitch happens. And we make illogical decisions.**Market Inefficiencies**So what about heuristics and framing? Ultimately, it creates market inefficiencies. What are market inefficiencies? Pricing things wrongly, making illogical decisions, etc.

## Why Study Behavioural Economics?

With economics, we like to predict things so we can make the best decisions. With classical economics, we assume that people are rational. Turns out, they are not. So with behavioural economics, we can predict people's irrationality that defy economic theory.

>Basically, we can predict better now.

How? There are a few ways, but a major way is called Prospect Theory. We evaluate options based on alternatives.Let's say I tell you that I will give you 100 followers on your LinkedIn. The value of that 100 followers depends on how many followers you currently have. 100 is the absolutely value. But 100 can be a lot psychologically, depending on the reference point. For someone with 500 followers, and it is nothing for someone with 10,000 followers. We also experience different sensitivity to the changes in followers. Adding 100 when you start with 500 feels better than adding 100 when you start with 10,000 followers. And we do love having more followers, who value and appreciate the work we do!If you don't remember anything, just remember that decisions are reference dependence. We need references to evaluate outcomes. And people don't evaluate options equally. It depends on the changes, relative to the reference point in absolute value. People are happier when the difference is smaller than when the difference is too huge.For example, 100 followers added to an account with 500 followers vs 10,000 followers.

# Why are we like that? Why are we so prone to influence?

We have two levels of thinking. We have our rational mind that tells us, “No, I don’t need to buy another roll of toilet paper.” But we also have a more primitive, visceral, gut reaction that says, “Well, I better be safe than sorry. There will be no more toilet paper anymore.”The herd instinct can also kick in, where people suspend judgement and start doing what everyone else is doing. So, if everyone else is panic-buying supplies, people follow the herd.Heuristics influence our choices which are irrational and counter intuitive; we need help making better choices.We are prone to influence in 6 ways:

1. **Reciprocation:** when someone does a favour for you, you are more likely to return the favour some day. For example, in crisis like this, China sends their doctors to Italy to help with the pandemic. I am certain this act will be reciprocated by Italy to China some day down the future.
2. **Social Proof/Consensus:** If you are in the blockchain space, are you sick of the word consensus? Consensus just means something the mass agrees to. It is also a form of social proof, because if everyone agrees to it, it is likely to be right. For example, if the WHO and government of major countries think that the virus requires a lockdown and pause on the economy, other countries are likely to follow suite and agree that it is the right course of action. I'm not saying it is irrational to do so, I'm just saying we can be easily influenced by the action that most people agree to do.
3. **Authority**: I notice this early on in my life. I've been to many events and conferences, where just because the speaker is an older caucasian dude talking about things, people just believe him. And when I stand up to correct the information, it always starts with looks of ""who you think you are, young asian female."" But when coherent points and arguments are made, the audience starts to view me with more authority. We think with our fast thinking brain, called System 1. And we apply stereotypes that we previously had. It's fine though, I think, as long as one is open to changes and be aware of the fast thinking that we have.
4. **Liking**: Believe or not, people like beautiful looking people and people that are similar to us. Model \*\*\*\*selling us something will influence us to purchase it more than some random ugly person on the street. We also like people who are similar to us, because familiarity is something we all love. That's why nostalgia sells. We end up getting influenced easily this way.
5. **Scarcity**: We simply want something more just because we can't have it. Why is Bitcoin so sought after? There will only be 21M Bitcoin in existence. Is there a real purpose for Bitcoin other than being a digital asset for investment? Maybe. Who knows. We are influenced and so captivated by the idea of scarcity, and that you can own something that someone else doesn't have. Who is the best example of this? Supreme and everything that Supreme sells. They sell scarcity. And people are influenced to pay $100 for a brick.
6. **Commitment & Consistency**: Lastly, consistency and commitment. We are more influenced by someone consistent in their message. For example, Bernie Sanders and his message during his lifetime career of being a politician. Or commitment by Sanders as he campaigns the same message all the time. We are more influenced by people who are committed and consistent.

None of these make logical sense, but hey, we are not always logical, right.

# How can we apply behavioural economics applied to token economics?

Firstly, it fits into Layer 2 of the economics design framework.Layer 1 is the system architecture. That is the nerdy things and coded in algorithms or hard coded in the system. The framework is available as a research paper.Layer 1 is limited, because it is based on classical economics and assumes rationality of people. We've already learnt that that fails. So we need Layer 2.Layer 2 is a game design that embeds behavioural economics into the experience. Think of user experience plus gamification.

## Gamified Systems

We can increase the probability of people's irrational actions through design. For example, I have 3 options:A: fruit basket for $15B: candy bars for $10C: fruit basket and candy bars for $15What would you get? Most probably option C.People rarely choose things in absolutely terms. We simply don't have an internal value meter for what things are worth. It is easier when the item is being compared, to get its internal value.**Example: exchange tokens.**Exchange tokens gather its value when traders get to pay in fiat, crypto or the native exchange tokens. When they get a better deal with the exchange tokens, they are more likely to want to get the tokens, instead of selling it in the secondary market. E.g. BNB token

## Nudge Theory

Nudge is a concept which proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals. Basically, influencing people's ""independent"" actions towards the behaviour you want.It's kind of like Pavlov and his dogs. Ring the bell and the dog salivate. But it is more than just that. An example is Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport attaching an image of a housefly into the men's room urinals. Men would pee to aim at the housefly and cleanliness of the urinal went up. I guess men are not good at peeing.**Example: deflationary token**A simple example is deflationary tokens. Tokens have limited supply, and when demand soars, the price of tokens will increase. How can we nudge the demand? By reducing supply available like staking to be a validator or staking to earn interest on stakes. The behaviour you want is to reduce available supply, so as to increase prices. So you can influence the behaviour by having a better trade-off: earning interest on tokens staked.

## 6 Influence Methods

1. **Reciprocation:** By adding value first, before extracting value. For example, Crypto. com provides value-add like free netflix, free amazon prime and free spotify when you sign up with their cards.
2. **Social Proof/Consensus:** The simplest example would be Augur, the online betting platform. But that **is** their business model, so it doesn't count. Why is Bitcoin so valuable? Almost all crypto-people I know have assets in Bitcoin. The social proof is strong. When prices of Bitcoin fell on 16 Mar 2020, instead of liquidating more, social media was asking everyone to purchase more, since prices were so low. That consensus brought prices of BTC up again in 24h.
3. **Authority**: Authority comes from the background of the founders, their experience, educational background and street cred in the space. This is most evident in blockchain projects by academic professors like Silvio Micali, who founded Algorand.
4. **Liking**: I still find this funny, but in Asia, you see companies hiring pretty females to model for their crypto-projects. And according to plenty of my male friends in the space, these girls do a great job at influencing males to sign up for their projects.
5. **Scarcity**: We simply want something more just because we can't have it. Following Bitcoin's path of limited supply, every other project has a capped supply of tokens to induce scarcity.
6. **Commitment & Consistency**: When Bitcoin's price fell on 16 Mar, the community was selling bitcoin hard on twitter and reddit. It's interesting because these people have quite some BTC in their portfolio, and they need to pump up the prices and continue the faith that BTC is worth something. Whatever it is, they are consistent in their message and truly committed in their shilling.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, many design of these crypto systems fail even with beautiful mathematical formula is that they miss out behavioral economics.Economics design of the crypto ecosystems are in 2 layers.Layer 1 is the system architecture. That is the nerdy things and coded in algorithms or hard coded in the system. For example, matching algorithms, resolution mechanisms and monetary policy.Layer 2 is a game design that embeds behavioural economics into the experience. That is user psychology plus gamification.If designing an ecosystem is like making creme brûlée, behavioural economics is using the blowtorch to caramalise the sugar to light golden brown. It's a very crucial and important step!

# 3 Discussion Takeaways Worth Pondering

1. Do you think designers need to abide by some regulations to ensure the morality of how systems are designed? It could go out of hand to influence people's decisions. This is evident in the countless of scams around.
2. Isn’t behavioral economics a depressing view of human nature?
3. How can we use good design for good purposes? For example, using nudge theory to encourage good behaviours. We collect data of someone's health status, and reward them with tokens when they attain certain healthy metrics. That's a positive use of nudge theory.","self","https://redd.it/sy6na6"

# General Conclusion

We shared about DEXes before. They are decentralised exchanges to allow for users to trade. The current popular assets being traded are assets at spot prices. A new improvement to that is margin trading. Margin trading is where you can trade more than the value of your asset. For example, you get to trade 10x the value of the asset that you have. Adding margin trading with DEX model is innovative and that is what we want to focus on today.Margin trading is a small category in DeFi Space. Although this niche does not have too many projects, there are outstanding projects: Kashi (from Sushiswap), dYdX, Perpetual Protocol, and so on.We recently shared about another perpetual swap mechanism in DeFi. Perpetual Swap had become the first product built on-chain for the derivatives market to achieve impressive trading volume numbers. 

# What Problem Does Margin DEX Solve?

When you trade on centralised exchanges (CEX), you will connect the market through an intermediary (exchange), your money will be managed by the exchange (custodial) whether you want it or not. Because of such a centralised model, CEX exchanges are often the top target for hackers to attack.Even the Top CEXs in the industry have been hacked, so I don't think the problem is ""was this exchange hacked or not?"" but ""when?"". In addition to security issues, the CEX exchange also has problems related to user fraud.Margin DEX was created to solve most of the above problems:

* Trustless: Users have access to the marketplace without the need for an intermediary.
* Non-Custodial: Users will be able to control and manage their own assets and do not need to deposit them with any party.
* Transparency: Everything will be operated through Smart Contract on Ethereum and managed by DAO in the future.
* Permissionless: Anyone, anywhere or at any time can access and use the platform of Perpetual Protocol without restricting permissions by anyone.

# Perpetual Protocol

Perpetual Protocol is a protocol that allows the issuance of perpetual futures contracts of any asset. The goal of Perpetual Protocol is to decentralise futures contracts, allowing anyone, anywhere, anytime to access and use the platform for trading without going through 3rd part.The core of the Perpetual Protocol is the project's protocol, which consists of two main parts:

* Virtual Automated Market Makers (Virtual AMMs): A virtual automated market maker (vAMM) model inspired by Uniswap. *Note: PerpProtocol is looking to move away from VAMM model.*
* Liquidity Reserve: Liquidity Reserve as collateral for Virtual AMMs.

# Kashi

This part details how Kashi works, and how it brings revolutionary innovation to L1. We want to explain the tie-up between BentoBox and its upcoming Dapps, including Kashi. BentoBox is a vault, acting as a decentralised “App Store”, where you can deposit assets inside to activate other Dapps.As such, Kashi is a Dapp developed on BentoBox, a margin trading platform backed by its lending protocol that allows users to create lending token pairs of varying degrees, however, they assume that profits can be maximised. **TLDR**:Both protocols serve in a potentially thriving derivatives market. Despite the common goal, the product architectures of the two protocols are vastly different.Perpetual Protocol provides star delivery contracts using vAMM Mechanism along with a Funding Rate. Especially when the trader is also LPer for their own position. This gives them higher leverage.Kashi is similar to a lending protocol but includes loan scalability features. That is, instead of mortgaging and getting a loan and mortgaging to get a new one, Kashi has integrated them into a single transaction. However, since the target collateral utilisation is 70-80%, the maximum leverage is quite low, theoretically x3, and Kashi offers x2 as the largest.","self","https://redd.it/sz0lxx"

Today, Monday 21st February 2022, we are pleased to announce that our efforts are paying off and we have been listed on Coin Market Cap (CMC). Not only that, but we are also extremely proud to have been listed as a top gaining coin on several well respected crypto platforms. For example, we have held on to first place as the top trending coin on crypto.com for the duration of today!

The attraction to our coin is simple. MegaMoons outstanding staking platform has been offering MASSIVE APYs straight from launch. This, coupled with our intelligent buy back system, has been countering selling pressure, providing the rocket fuel needed to catapult MegaMoon up the crypto chart.

Today’s performance of the coin has demonstrated to all the evidence that they have wanted to see - that the MegaMoon mechanism is working and propelling this coin further forward in the crypto field. 💯

But we are not content in stopping there.

We aim for a global reach and offer everyone the possibility to buy the token with a simple click.

Implementing a credit card buy feature was a no brainer for us - this feature will allow anyone to become an investor, even without previous crypto experience.

At the same time we're looking to develop our own wallet, a swap with minimalistic fees (which we dream of converting into a proper exchange) and voting DApp which will allow users to vote on future developments, investments, charities etc

We will be employing the right marketing to gain massive exposure inside and outside the crypto space.

Every month we will be donating a percentage of the funds to a well chosen charity to ensure we make our efforts to support a good cause.

BSC investors love to get on the Moon! Therefore we designed the perfect combination of tokenomics to make sure we have a MegaMoon!

8% of any sells will be used to automatically buy back the token, solidifying the liquidity pool and adding to the price appreciation. Once these steps have been completed, these tokens are automatically burned forever!!!

We hope that these measures and actions will assure every investor that any sell pressure will be met by active buying pressure.

Our project is offering staking on the BSC straight off the bat. Every investor can connect their wallet and stake their tokens for massive APY rewards, funded with automatic reflections!!!

Token allocation

2% Team tokens - Locked

4% Private Sale - Distributed before presale

# General Classification

You hear these terms often. These are general blockchain terms.

* You are a retail crypto-trader: does not affect you that much
* You are a developer: affects you depending on what are you building
* You are a regulator: affects you depending on what you want to regulate

# 1) Layer 1

Layer 1 is just the base layer.If you imagine there's blockchain has different a kind of blocks this is basic layer 1 as in a tech stack and then on top, you could have another kind of systems, processes and technological stack.**Crypto Examples:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot. These are different kinds of layer 1 solutions and you could build things on top of them.**Tech world examples:** IMAP protocol to send your email from gmail. com to [yahoo.  com](http://yahoo.com/).**Why is the distinction important?** The economics involved in layer one is very different from the economics of layer 2 and the other kind of layers.

## 2) Layer 2

If layer 1 is the base layer, layer 2 is something that's being built upon it. Layer 2 is usually the scalable solutions and that helps transactions faster.Layer 1 is good. The objective is to send data in a distributed way and to make sure the other attacks don't happen. That's security. And usually, it means to sacrifice scalability. Layer 2 solves this.**Crypto Examples:** Lightning network, Plasma chain, and zk-Rollups.**Tech world examples:** 5G vs 2G**Why is layer 2 important?** It helps with mainstream adoption for other digital products and services that need speed.

## 3) Dapp

Dapps are decentralised applications. They can be related to finance (DeFi), esports (usually NFT), art (also NFT). They are built on top of Layer 1 or Layer 2. These are applications that you can use.**Crypto Examples:** Yearn, Nexus Mutual, and Axie Infinity**Tech world examples:** iOS/Andriod is Layer 1. Instagram app, Telegram app, and web broswer are Dapp.**Why is Dapp important?** You can hold $ETH or $BTC or $DOT. There's nothing much you can do with it. Dapps are applications where you can have more use-cases with your tokens.

# DeFi General Terms

Another set of terms you hear often. These are general finance terms specific to crypto.

* You are a retail crypto-trader: affects you. Basically your bread and butter.
* You are a developer: affects you depending on what are you building.
* You are a regulator: affects you depending on what you want to regulate.

## 4) DeFi

DeFi: decentralised finance.DeFi looks to reduce intermediaries in the financial space by decentralising the operations. That is different from the capital market, aka traditional (centralised) finance. Sometimes, that is known as TradFi or CeFi.**What will be decentralised?** The entire governance mechanism and technology layer will be completely decentralised. And the beginning for DeFi was Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer currency.Now the cryptocurrency space has grown a bit more. We have lending platforms, d-exchanges, derivatives, insurance and the aggregators. So, decentralised finance has developed a lot of things beyond just p2p lending and Bitcoin.**DeFi Examples:** P2P currency and technology to remove double-spending**CeFi examples:** Currency issued by the central bank**Why is DeFi important?** It opens up financial access to everyone without intermediaries.

## 5) Money Lego

Go back to being a child. You are playing with Lego. You can stack them up and create different types of Lego structure.Now you are an adult. You play with a different type of Lego. It's money Lego. That means the various technological pieces as lego bricks to build new financial product or infrastructure.More specifically, it is to combine various products (lending, exchange, options, insurance) and connect them to other products.For Example, we have ETH and want to trade/hedge. So that, we can mortgage ETH on Compound to receive DAI and transfer DAI to a pool on Uniswap to buy more ETH. Or we can go to derivatives platform and hedge our positions. This is Money Lego that you can stack many types of protocols.**DeFi Examples:** Collateralise ETH on Compound to borrow DAI (lending) and exchange it for Cream (exchange) and use Cream to stake in various liquidity pools to get an annualised return.**CeFi world examples:** A similar example is Repo.**Why is Money Lego important?** This allows for each protocol to specialise in a specific financial instrument and allow anyone to use them as a tool to create new products.

## 6) Composability

Composability is a systems design principle. A protocol can be broken down by different functions and its functions can be used for other purposes. Compostability is very similar to Money Lego.Different protocols are created with specific purposes, but you can use their functions to achieve your goals.For example, you can combine the loan functionality of Compound + exchange from Uniswap and provide liquidity on Sushiswap = to create a decentralised derivative exchange with one click. Instead of building everything from scratch. That's the general idea of DeFi, which is evolving very quickly.","self","https://redd.it/szuhfw"

When we discuss risks in crypto, we look at both risks from the perspective of token owners and risks from the protocol. By knowing their major sources of risk exposures, we can have a better picture of what the protocol will possibly be like in the long term, and a more thorough understanding of the whole crypto space. In this article, we will walk through a general framework and additional points to consider for financial risk analysis of stablecoins.

**General classification of risk**

Before moving on to financial risk in details, let’s recap on the general classification of risk that we are using. Under our analytical framework, risk is either systematic or idiosyncratic.

Systematic risk are the ones that affect the whole market and cannot be well controlled by the protocol itself. This includes the market risk like price variations, failure of underlying blockchain layer and irregular user behaviour.

Meanwhile, Idiosyncratic risk are the ones that are relevant to token and mechanism design, which can be controlled by the protocol to some extent and only directly affects the particular protocol itself.

 

Fig 1. General risk classification

Under our definition, financial risk is a type of idiosyncratic risk. It describes the risk of losing money in operation, which is predominantly determined by how the token is designed under the protocol. Financial risk for stablecoins comes from two main areas: cashflow and collaterals.

**Financial risk from cashflow**

When conducting risk analysis, cashflow is often one of the most direct and easily analyzable sources of risk. Changes in cashflow for the protocol over time gives information on how well the protocol is operating, and also its ability of pulling through a crisis. Meanwhile, cross comparison of cashflow figures and growth with other protocols can show which tokens in the market are in better financial standing and hence likely to be more sustainable.

In the long term, protocols with healthier cashflow conditions are more likely to gain investor confidence and attract more people in buying the tokens. This is extremely important for stablecoins, as their values are pegged to a previously specified amount with very minimal variation in monetary values. Investors make decisions to buy stablecoins based on how they plan to utilize the token, and also whether the token is reliable in the future.

The most common way to analyze financial risk from cashflow is to break down the incoming and outgoing cash over fixed time intervals, and compare their growth. Depending on how the protocol is designed, income and expense can be further classified into sub-categories based on where they come from, such as interest, trading and operating. Significant changes in the proportions of each category may indicate structural changes in the protocol’s financial performance.

Advancing to a higher level of analysis, we can look at the key ratios calculated from cashflow data. These key ratios are created based on the data available for each protocol to compare income and expense data with the important token metrics such as price, transaction volume and market capitalization. Some of the possible key ratios that can be considered, but not limited to, are the following:

* Percentage of each sub-category of income and expense
* Ratio of cash inflow to outflow
* Protocol net income to market capitalization
* Protocol revenue income to market capitalization

Changes in these ratios give information on how the protocol has been growing over time, which helps us to identify the stage of development and expected amount of variations in finance performance to better gauge their level of risk exposures. Given the complexity of token data and the fact that most protocols have only been created in the very recent years, we are still unable to form a clear cut-off for these ratios to distinguish between the different levels of risk. Nonetheless, these ratios can be used for comparison across time and market. Also, we will expect newer projects to have less stable financials, so the seemingly negative ratios in the early stage may not lead to the conclusion that protocol is facing high financial risk. But for projects that have existed for years with a stable pool of users, significant variations of key ratios may hint there could be changes in operation that changed the token holders’ decisions and unhealthy cashflow.

**Financial risk from collaterals**

Another significant source of financial risk of stablecoins comes from the collaterals. In the token market today, stablecoins maintain stability of value through collaterals or algorithmic mechanisms that balances the reserved assets. The types of collaterals used directly impacts buying decisions of the stablecoin, hence play an important role in determining the financial risk exposures. To analyze such risk, we will first look at how the stablecoin maintains its value, whether the reserve is made up of on-chain assets (other tokens), off-chain assets (cash and cash equivalents), a combination of the two, or through algorithms with no reserve or partial reserve.

1. On-chain collateral  
For stablecoins collateralized with on-chain assets such as DAI and LUSD, the degree of transparency is often the highest as collateral data can be queried. We can study the composition of collaterals, including what are the assets making up the collateral pool, collaterization ratio of each type of asset and if there had been any significant changes in the structure of collateral pool in the past. For a stablecoin to be considered as having low financial risk exposure, the collateral pool should be relatively stable with no significant flux in proportion of each asset type. The collateralization ratio should also be set to a reasonable range, such that the value of collateral reserve can still sustain if there is a sudden decrease in collateralized asset prices, but also not to an overly high level that discourages investors from holding the token.
2. Off-chain collateral  
For stablecoins collateralized with off-chain assets, such as cash, commercial paper, fiduciary deposits, secured loans, short term treasury bills, corporate bonds and other investments. For these tokens, financial risk exposure is lower when the proportion of cash is higher, as a reserve pool will have better ability to deal with unexpected situations that require high liquidity of assets. On the other end, tokens backed with assets that cannot be readily converted to cash may not stabilize to its pegged value when there is a sudden drop in collateral value. An important point to note here is that some protocols do not give a clear breakdown on the components of their fiat reserve. Instead of disclosing the proportion of cash, they report the proportion of cash and cash equivalents together to make the numbers more appealing to investors. Such lack of transparency will also lead to doubts and inconfidence, thereby increasing financial risk exposure.
3. Non-collateralized  
Lastly, there is also a group of stablecoins that uses supply-changing algorithms to maintain its token price to a pegged value. Some of these tokens are partially backed by on-chain and off-chain reserves, while others are uncollateralized. For these algorithmic coins, we need to make specific analysis according to their structure of collateral. If they are completely unbacked, we can instead focus on the financial cashflow and ability of these tokens to maintain at a stable price.

**Financial risk from token performance**

In addition to factors arising from token design and mechanism, token’s performance is also a critical factor of financial risk. These include the ability of the stablecoin pegging to a specific monetary value, market dominance and applied uses that directly affect token’s transaction activities and income.

Low price volatility indicates that the token is well-backed by collaterals or supply is under control by algorithms, hence has better ability to store and maintain monetary value. This will attract more people to hold the stablecoin and more platforms to utilise it. We can also consider indicators like market dominance, and overall ranking of the stablecoin in the whole token market. Tokens with better rankings are likely to have more investors and transaction volume, which bring a stable income stream and enhances the protocol’s resilience against financial risk.

C**onclusion**

Just like the case for many other financial assets, risk analysis for stablecoins is a complex process with no clear distinctions or standards, and we may face many difficulties in deducing the level of risk present. But going from the main sources of risk from financial performance, collaterals and token performance, we can get a general picture of the financial risk exposures of a protocol. Due to the difference in design and mechanism of the various protocols, a thorough risk analysis needs to cover multiple aspects and may require analysts to create new metrics specifically applicable to the protocol.

Some additional points to consider here include the time frame of data used, as financial risk is a long term concept that is hard to predict if there are unexpected changes in token design after governance voting or new regulation being implemented. Some metrics may also have double-sided impact on financial risk. For example, over-collateralization gives a stable cash reserve to sustain through a financial shock, but also leads to large amounts of funds unused which may hinder token’s scalability in the long term. Thus, we need to be aware of these limitations, understand the interactions between different types of risks and make careful judgements when determining the level of risk exposures.","self","https://redd.it/t0m83w"

​	Uniswap launched V3 in May 2021, the core feature of the upgrade is to introduce the concentrated liquidity. The team developed a set of smart contracts with elegant codes (I read almost all the code and full of praise), allow the LP to provide liquidity within the price range specified by himself.

​	As known to all, in Uniswap V2, LP will suffer from impermanent loss, but impermanent loss is only a theoretical loss. After LP add liquidity into pool, there is no need to move it. No matter how the token price changes, as long as the price recover, the total asset value of LP will remain unchanged (we only study the loss of principal invested, not considering the fees). But in Uniswap V3, when the price is out of the range of the LP position, LP need to move the position,  once the price recover, LP has suffered a loss.  The property of this kind of loss is completely different from impermanent loss, it is permanent loss.

​	In this article, we study the causes of the loss suffered by LP in position movement in Uniswap V3, and how much loss LP has suffered in each position movement operation, and try to find out, whether there is the best way to avoid the loss of position movement.

# Impermanent Loss in Uniswap V2

​	In Uniswap v2, LP add liquidity into pool with two equivalent token assets, when the price of a token rises, the number of that token in LP assets will decrease. Therefore, the increase of LP assets is not as high as that of directly holding this kind of token. When the price of that token rises, LP will suffer a theoretical loss, which is called impermanent loss.

​	How much is the impermanence loss? We use the following chart to illustrate:

>Here we simulated ETH-USDC trading pair, the initial ETH price is set to 1,000 USDC, initial investment is 2,000 USDC. When the ETH price changes, the total value change curve of holding and adding into the liquidity pool. The x-axis represents the ETH price changes, and the y-axis represents the total value of holding and adding into the pool, the blue curve is the holding value, the orange curve is adding into the pool. Impermanent Loss

&#x200B;

[figure-1](https://preview.redd.it/1phlut881yj81.png?width=2077&format=png&auto=webp&s=678be2528c794a02046baa56db7e94bdcf9e8fed)

From the chart it can be seen that the total value of holding is linear with ETH price, therefore the total value of adding into the pool is linear with the square root of ETH price.  We only simulate that the ETH price rises to 10 times the initial price, that is, 10,000 USDC, at that point, the impermanent loss is the maximum (about 4,675 USDC). Obviously, the more price rise, the greater the impermanent loss.  When the ETH price falls, the impermanence loss is the largest when the ETH price falls to 0,  1,000 USDC maximum. 

However, it should be emphasized that: Impermanent loss in Uniswap V2 is  only a theoretical loss!  After all, the price always goes up and down. When it recover, the total value of LP will back to the initial, impermanent loss will disappear. In theory, as long as the risk of the token price falling to 0 is very low, and stay in the pool long enough, the fees collected can always cover the impermanent loss.

The conclusion is that in Uniswap V2, what LP really needs to consider is how much of the proceeds. But, in Uniswap V3,  the loss to be suffered by LP is completely different from the impermanent loss. In Uniswap V3, when LP move their positions, they suffer a permanent loss rather than impermanent loss!","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4MiCgTdNoLM1kD6LxZop_gKnapbQABy44wwQQfeBSeU.jpg","https://redd.it/t0zezo"

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!

Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.

Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

# 2. Good Bad Ugly

\[**Good**\] **It works.** This native token is an **incentive for liquidity providers**. That is exactly what [exchange platforms](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/its-bye-or-buy-nance) are doing with their native tokens too, by incentivising market makers. It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens. It works of the platform because they are **onboarding new users**.

\[**Good**\] **Projects** like these are way **beyond** the stage of **just a white paper**. We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base.

\[**Bad**\] This is **still a short-term incentive that is not sustainable**. What happens when the hype of trading is gone? Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade? Or when tokens are all given out?

\[**Bad**\] So far, it seems like the **yield is a zero-sum game**. If you don't know how to play, you should not participate. It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie, but for now, it is a beautiful zero sum. It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses. If you don’t have insider knowledge or strategic advantage, you are not earning yield. You are the yield.

\[**Ugly**\] The real ugly part is the **hidden string attached**. Due to all the trade going on on ethereum, gas fees have shot through the roof. So **beware of gas fees, slippage fee, asset volatility.**

\[**Ugly**\] **Leveraged trading** can be good to secure greater upsides, but the downside can also be quite steep, especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly, if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps.

\[**Ugly**\] Because there are so many transactions (that may or may not be inflated), the transaction fees have soared. So, Ethereum is looking to i**ncrease the block size.** This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns, but this is ugly risk in the long run because **ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network.**

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

# Apply To Your Project

This is a typical method for issuing tokens based on transaction volume, as we see in exchange tokens. Check out the BNB episode for the economics of that.

Yield farming is a growth hacking way to achieve network effects. It uses short-term incentives to drive user growth. At the end of the day, we are looking at the bigger game. In the long-run, how sustainable will the platform be. The real economic value comes from building products that benefits users in a sustainable manner, not with hypes and pumps. That means actual financial activity for DeFi protocols, so that monetary value increase is not just driven by ""sophisticated leveraged speculation"" but real value-add.

**TLDR**:

For crypto-entrepreneurs and long-term investors, yield farming works. But it is still a short-term incentive and not a long-term solution. So use this method with precaution.","self","https://redd.it/t1r1qf"

I'm learning about being a liquidity provider, and what the options are to adjust your risk-rewards.

I understand that making the range in which you provide liquidity more *tight* makes it so that you have higher returns (in fees) when the price is in that range, but you make nothing when it moves out. So when you make it *wider* , you make less in fees on average, but you're earning more of the time (because the price won't move out of the range where you're providing).

My question - couldn't you just constantly adjust an extremely tight range, so that you always provide liquidity essentially EXACTLY where the price is, raking in huge profits from fees?

Are there fees associated with changing your liquidity range/bounds?

I'd greatly appreciate your help in understanding this! Surely there's something I'm missing.","self","https://redd.it/t2fnto"

**TLDR**:

This is the start of tokenising value. Either economical value, intrinsic value or even volatility value. Leverage tokens are fun because they are tokens, which are governed by programmable codes and math!

# General Conclusion

I think we have covered sufficient basics of the economics of token engineering and the principles involved. Hope you are read to dive into the real fun stuff!

>Please let me know if you want more foundational episodes. Otherwise, it will be more application and case studies moving forward.

This week in on Leveraged Tokens. DeFi is exploding. You know that, we [talked](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/ep-15-good-bad-ugly-of-yield-farming) about [that](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/its-bye-or-buy-nance), you probably are part of that. But this is **only just the beginning**. The power of DeFi is in 2 folds. (1) Decentralised governance and (2) Programmable codes and internal valuation that can be tokenised.

Tokens are not just a pump and dump scheme anymore. This is not 2017. Instead, tokens now represent certain economic value generated by the system (e.g. network tokens) or certain internal value (e.g. leveraged tokens).

Leveraged token is just an example of the power tokenisation can bring. Internal rules and governance enforced with programmable codes in the tokens. The future is now.

# 1. Leveraged Tokens 101

This is not something everyone knows about. So before I begin, I will caution that this is **A VERY HIGH RISK PRODUCT.** Other than the usual supply and demand, such token has internal valuation and so you have internal risks. Like [volatility drag](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/03/23/the-myth-of-volatility-drag-part-1/) on asset, [beta slippage](https://www.hitcapitallllp.com/beta-slippage/) on trade, price movement of underlying assets.

* **Who** issues: derivatives exchange like FTX
* **What** is that: token that gives you leveraged position instead of you manually managing the position  

   * aka it does all the admin stuff like buying, selling, rebalancing
* **Where** to get access: exchanges. They are ERC20 tokens, so they can be traded on spot market.
* **When** to use: increase exposure to market  

   * use it with caution!
* **Why** use it: easier to manage risk, manage margin
* **How** to use: purchase on spot market to get leveraged exposure

# 2. So... when do I use it?

Let's say you want to bet on that Kanye West will be the next US President. And you are very sure of this, because he is so stable, mentally healthy, creative at making music and good at being rich. Ah, the American dream. Now, you want to bet that he wins. But you only have $10. You wish for more, so you can place your bet. When he wins, you get more money. So you go to a friend, and he says ""ok tell you what, I will lend you $20, so now you have $30 to bet that Kanye West will be the next president.""

In the same way, leveraged position gives you more exposure to your bet. More than the assets you have. Instead of just a position, you can now tokenise it. (With math and programmable codes, which is shown in the YouTube Episode.)

So, leveraged tokens give you more exposure to the market. If you are certain of your bet, you use it.

In the DeFi space, that means betting if prices go up or down. E.g. I bet that BTC will go up. So I long BTC by buying the Futures contract. (That is me making my bet.) Instead of that, you can get a tokenised leveraged position via leveraged tokens.

Or maybe I think ETH will fall. So I bet that. That means shorting ETH. You can do that with leveraged tokens too.

Currently, you can get access to leveraged tokens (they are traded via exchanges) on [FTX](https://leveragedtokens.com/) and a few other platforms.

# 3. Internal Valuation of Leveraged Tokens

The fun part of leveraged tokens is that it is has internal value. Its value does not come from supply and demand on the secondary market. If you are an options person, think of it as leveraged tokens having intrinsic value and no extrinsic value. If you are a regular crypto person, leveraged tokens has its value coming from its position, based on the market. It is just something you can ""pump and dump"" per say.

The internal price is dependent on a few things:

* Net asset value
* Price movement of Futures contract
* Revaluation that affect Futures contract
* Slippage fees and other fees

**TLDR**:

We have seen a lot of KOLs memes about cryptocurrencies and how that has affected the price. Especially with Elon Musk, one of the most famous people on the planet has also had coin meme actions like talking about Dogecoin and Bitcoin. His Tweets have greatly influenced the price of the above cryptocurrencies and the market as a whole.

We are not talking about good or bad here, but for the main market, but something like this can be a good signal for people to know more about crypto space. But on the contrary, it also brings risks when people consider the coin meme as an action to invest in. We need to be careful, have our own analysis to be wise in a market like this.

# Introduction

>This is a guest post by [Dr Viroshan Naicker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viroshan-naicker/). With a focus on mathematics and graph theory, Dr Naicker brings in his insight into how nodes interact, similar to how powerful nodes like Elon Musk affects interactions between nodes and edges in a network.

Elon Musk has always evoked public interest (as billionaire genius types tend to do). The ongoing story this year, for better or worse, has been in the crypto space, where people have [taken](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284291528328790016) their cues from his [views.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?lang=en)

Earlier this year Tesla caused waves when they published their [balance sheet](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm) and announced to the world that they had 1.5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) listed as an asset. More recently, Musk's comments have prompted crypto sales that have seen the price of Bitcoin tumble from above $60,000 into the $30,000-$40,000 range. Overall, the collective crypto market cap fell by just over a trillion dollars over May.

# Musk and Market

>So why does Elon seem to have this power to influence the world of crypto?

First, let's talk about **money** in **all its forms: fiat and crypto**. Arguably, **money is a type of social power storage, like a battery**. We use it to temporarily **store our power to engage others** (on our projects and for our whims), and when we pay for a good or a service, we draw on that power. In a similar vein to electricity, it is a consumable resource and is transferred as it is used.

After that, the question is which money (or battery) to use? History shows that an implicit contract exists between society and the choice of money system: At various points in world history, including Weimar, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, nation state-backed fiat systems have broken down because economic agents broke this contract.

Elon Musk, in this context, has a good amount of stored social power (money). This social power he harnesses can move markets, as we see below.

# Market and Money

This points to **monetary systems as a type of database that accounts for social power**, but only if **we agree to use that database**. In this vein, a token system is a medium for value storage (and possibly utility storage) for a network of users that choose to adopt that system using a social contract. If the database is corrupt, why would you use it?

Less dramatic than the collapse of a national currency is the assignment of social power to crypto assets. Over a decade, a social contract has developed between crypto and a user network, along with bridges between crypto tokens and fiat tokens as valid stores of value. Remember the guy who paid 10,000BTC for two pizzas in 2010? That was the start of a social contract that turned BTC into a form of social power storage.

The beauty of crypto is that we are now moving from a type of general-purpose money backed by states to a system of fit-for-purpose tokens that do weird and wonderful things. However, the network effects on cryptocurrencies are more pronounced and subject to social whimsy.

# Musk and Money

Elon’s whims can either **endorse the implicit contract** between BTC and other forms of **storing social power** (Dogecoin) or they can repudiate this contract. Earlier this year, the decision to add BTC to the balance sheets of Tesla acted as an **endorsement of value**. And so, on cue, people bought more BTC.

Now Elon is tweeting the other way, and Tesla has decided not to accept BTC as a form of payment for its vehicles. The good news is that while toddlers stumble more than adults, eventually, we all learn to walk.

# Bitcoin, the new money

The difference between crypto and fiat is simple. We are privatising money. Thus, the risk to governments everywhere is that society decouples (at least partially) from the default, nation-state fiat store of value because there are valid alternatives. Is it good or bad? You decide.","self","https://redd.it/t3bn8k"

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

In this post, I’d like to introduce xToken, outline the capabilities of our soon-to-launch platform xToken Terminal, and lay out the business case for using Terminal’s Liquidity Mining app.

**About xToken**

Since we launched in July 2020, we've served thousands of DeFi users with our native staking and liquidity strategies, processing over $300 million in primary volume across our funds and peaking at $150 million in TVL. Given our deep expertise with Uniswap V3 strategies and unique experience working with other DeFi projects, we’ve transitioned to building DeFi infrastructure to simplify financial primitives.

Our new platform, xToken Terminal, aims to be the most trusted and robust capital markets and liquidity management platform for Web3. We want to provide DeFi projects with seamless access to fundamental on-chain primitives. Mining, the first app deployed on Terminal, allows a project to deploy and configure a customized Uniswap V3 liquidity mining campaign in a few easy clicks — freeing up valuable development resources while providing an enhanced user experience, added configurability, and augmented security.

**Why Should I Incentivize Liquidity on V3?**

Uniswap V3 is a step-function improvement in the AMM space, offering better capital efficiency for liquidity providers, improved execution for traders, and a more powerful launchpad for DeFi infrastructure. We believe that liquidity will continue to migrate from V2 (and elsewhere) and that V3 will cement itself as the preeminent DEX.

For DeFi projects and DAO’s alike, maintaining a strong liquidity presence on Uniswap V3 enhances community access to your token(s), while helping to promote discoverability and connectedness with the rest of the Web3 ecosystem.

**The Problem with Current V3 Liquidity Mining Solutions**

Unlike V2, integrating with the Uniswap V3 contracts requires significant development expertise. Projects pursuing LM on Uni V3 spend precious resources developing custom contracts or writing complex off-chain scripts – time that could be used to develop the core product offering.

While there are a few active solutions currently being used in the ecosystem, we believe there should be a complete, end-to-end solution with customizable features, top-notch UX and an emphasis on trustlessness and discoverability.

**The Terminal Difference**

With Terminal’s Mining app, xToken has built an integrated, configurable architecture that allows partners to permissionlessly configure and deploy V3 liquidity mining programs in a few easy clicks.

What makes Mining the best solution for Uni V3 LM?

* Ease of use for pool sponsors:
   * DeFi projects can deploy and configure a highly customized LM program via the intuitive Terminal UI in a matter of minutes
* Ease of use and end-to-end experience for LPs
   * Users deposit liquidity through the Terminal UI and are immediately earning rewards. No need to engage with multiple UIs or deposit LP tokens to external staking rewards contracts
* Full feature set
   * Sponsors can customize their programs with any Uni V3 price range, multiple rewards tokens and an optional vesting period on rewards
   * The data-rich Terminal UI provides useful pool data for both sponsors and LPs
* Enhanced security
   * Our contracts have been audited by ABDK and CertiK and we’ve launched an ImmuneFi Bug Bounty program.
* Low fees
   * We charge a small one-time pool deployment fee and a 1% fee on distributed rewards. All fees from rewards are paid back to $XTK stakers.
* Discoverability
   * All deployed Mining pools will be viewable on the Terminal app, providing a new way for DeFi users to discover your community

I'm following the guide: [https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/guides/auto-router](https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/guides/auto-router)

Here's some of my code:

    import { AlphaRouter } from '@uniswap/smart-order-router';
    import { Token, CurrencyAmount, TradeType, Percent } from '@uniswap/sdk-core';
    import { JSBI } from '@uniswap/sdk';
    
    const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://polygon-mainnet<...link>', 137);
    const router = new AlphaRouter({ chainId: 137, provider });
    
    const typedValueParsed = '10000000000000';
    const usdcxAmount = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(MATIC, JSBI.BigInt(typedValueParsed));
    
    const route = router.route(
        usdcxAmount,
        USDC,
        TradeType.EXACT_INPUT,
        {
          recipient: address,
          slippageTolerance: new Percent(5, 100),
          deadline: 100,
        },
    );

The error I get is:

Is there something I'm doing wrong? Or is this an error with AlphaRouter itself?

Fortunately, with the support of my seasoned trading pals, I was swiftly pushed on to realize the potential of this form of trading and searching when I began making 50x on my first deals in 2020.It's critical to capture a good coin early, as long as it's a good coin that has been well analyzed. 

Scams and rug pulls are the most common risks in this form of trade. As was the situation with the SQUID token following the Netflix release of the Squid game series. They took advantage of the buzz to make some money and pull the rug out from under the ones at the top.If you've been trading for a while, you should find this to be a simple read. 

The first stage is to examine the team and ensure that they are well-equipped and experienced. You should also consider the investors and funders who will provide the project with cash.One thing to consider is their marketing performance; good new ventures will frequently recognize the value of marketing and invest heavily in their marketing efforts. Bad ventures will frequently go beyond in their marketing and pull the rug out from under them as soon as they reach a tremendous peak and begin to decline.

Read their plan and research their philosophy and long-term objectives to determine whether a coin is a good one or a shitcoin. This is the method I try to use when I'm looking for new opportunities and tokens in the market, like as when I first discovered LRC and IMX way before the gamestop hype or when I'm looking at [Apollo Inu right now.](https://investapollocrypto.com/home) 

The latter appears to be successful, as it enters the lucrative industry of entertainment and content creation and essentially creator tokens. It's all really strong, where  A portion of every purchase, sale, and trade of Apollo goes to a “Creator Prize Fund” controlled by the Apollo community through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or “DAO”. Every week, anyone who owns Apollo votes for a winning creator who receives the funds they need and spreads the word about Apollo to other deserving creatives, helping to grow the Apollo community of creators, investors, and supporters

  Today, Monday 21st February 2022, we are pleased to announce that our efforts are paying off and we have been listed on Coin Market Cap (CMC).  Not only that, but we are also extremely proud to have been listed as a top gaining coin on several well respected crypto platforms.  For example, we have held on to first place as the top trending coin on crypto.com for the duration of today! 

  The attraction to our coin is simple.  MegaMoons outstanding staking platform has been offering MASSIVE APYs straight from launch. This, coupled with our intelligent buy back system, has been countering selling pressure, providing the rocket fuel needed to catapult MegaMoon up the crypto chart.   

  Today’s performance of the coin has demonstrated to all the evidence that they have wanted to see - that the MegaMoon mechanism is working and propelling this coin further forward in the crypto field.  💯  

But we are not content in stopping there. 

We aim for a global reach and offer everyone the possibility to buy the token with a simple click.  

  Implementing a credit card buy feature was a no brainer for us - this feature will allow anyone to become an investor, even without previous crypto experience.  

  At the same time we're looking to develop our own wallet, a swap with minimalistic fees (which we dream of converting into a proper exchange) and voting DApp which will allow users to vote on future developments, investments, charities etc 

We will be employing the right marketing to gain massive exposure inside and outside the crypto space. 

  Every month we will be donating a percentage of the funds to a well chosen charity to ensure we make our efforts to support a good cause.  

  BSC investors love to get on the Moon! Therefore we designed the perfect combination of tokenomics to make sure we have a MegaMoon!  

  8% of any sells will be used to automatically buy back the token, solidifying the liquidity pool and adding to the price appreciation. Once these steps have been completed, these tokens are automatically burned forever!!! 

  We hope that these measures and actions will assure every investor that any sell pressure will be met by active buying pressure. 

  Our project is offering staking on the BSC straight off the bat. Every investor can connect their wallet and stake their tokens for massive APY rewards, funded with automatic reflections!!!

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock","self","https://redd.it/tagbsh"

✅ The funds stay on YOUR WALLET !

Just a few seconds to use it and you just need to use BscScan.

&#x200B;

Exploit     the recent staking bug discovered on Pancakeswap ! This allows you,     thanks to a simple command via Binance’s official block explorer     (BSCSCAN), to earn 20% per hour on your stacked funds ! The Tutorial     only lasts a few seconds and it will earn you a lot of money depending     on the BUSD funds you would leave in your wallet.

This     bug which is not yet patched because recently discovered. Allows     tricking the transactions contract, called the Pancakeswap Router. By     tricking him into thinking you’ve been stake your funds on the     Pancakeswap Router for quite a while. This one and thanks to the code     used only on BSCSCAN, will indeed believe that you have stacked for the     very long term. This is why the staking bonus is 20% per hour, which   is   huge ! Hurry up and use it before it's fixed !

If     for example, you stack $1000 for 24 hours using this trick, you can   easily generate up to $3500 ! By using this trick your funds remain     throughout the operation on your wallet. You can move them and undo the     operation as you see fit. Come on, let’s go, I’ll show you how to do   it   by explaining the technical part.

I cannot figure out on how to fetch prices from Uniswap. Actually, I tried using the doc, but it's using ether.js and TypeScript.

How can I fetch prices about a pair, e.g. WETH/DAI, using JS (instead of TS), and using Web3.js instead of Ether.js.

Cake Defi is a decentralized finance platform based in Singapore, utilising the Defichain blockchain which is secured by anchoring with the btc blockchain. Cake Defi offer a very generous $30 sign-up bonus, paid instantly as DFI (Defichain), for anybody who deposits $50. This does not require any additional transactions or trades, just **a deposit which you will be able to instantly withdraw** if you need to.

Cake Defi is currently best accessed via the website, although mobile applications are being developed and are currently undergoing beta testing.

[Referral-Link to get the $30 Bonus](https://app.cakedefi.com/?ref=571562)

[Non-Ref Link (no Bonus)](https://app.cakedefi.com/)

1. Sign-up to Cake Defi using the referral link and ensure that there is the information: *""Referral code has been applied* ***571562***\*""\* to ensure you receive the bonus.
2. Verify your identity using photo ID. This used to take up to 72 hours, but should be much faster for most of the time.
3. *Deposit $50*. There is a limited number of currencies that can be used and if you are planning to withdraw your deposit instantly I would strongly recommend DASH as it has the lowest withdrawal fees. Bitcoin Cash has the next lowest withdrawal fee, followed by Doge and then Litecoin. I suggest checking the withdrawal fee page before signing up to see which suits you best.
4. Once your deposit has been received, your *sign-up bonus of $30* will be paid into your account instantly. This will be staked and locked for 180 days however it does earn interest during that time, currently around **35% APY!** Go to the freezer section and turn off auto-renew if you will want to withdraw after 180 days.
5. The DASH, or whatever you deposited, can be immediately withdrawn to wherever it was deposited from and if necessary, exchanged to GBP and withdrawn to your bank account.
6. After 180 days, withdraw your bonus along with the interest it has accrued. Obviously you are able to do Liquidity Mining on CakeDefi.
7. Do the Learn Lesson and get another $5 of DFI.

I have been really impressed with Cake and Defichain as a whole. I invested a bit more than the $50 and due to Liquidity Mining it already gave a nice bonus which I really apprechiate. I am now using the Freezer on Cake Defi to stake more DFI over a much longer timeframe than the initial 6 months as the APY is fantastic, the longer timeframes gives discounts on fees and I can see the value of the coin appreciating over the next few years.

Cake do have other opportunities to earn interest on your crypto using their liquidity pools or via lending. BTC, ETH, BCH, DOGE, LTC and USDT all have good APRs, just keep an eye on the withdrawal fees for BTC, ETH and USDT to ensure you stake enough or for long enough to make it worth your while.

For anybody struggling with buying DASH, it can be purchased at Bitpanda as previously mentioned, but also Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex and Kucoin. Deposit/withdrawal fees and methods across these exchanges vary.

It looks amazing!!","None",0.4,0,0,0,0,0,"NekoCore are 9,999 adorable cats piloting crazy mechas. Hand drawn by Jed Henry (instagram.com/thejedhenry), the collection features 4 complete sets of original and unique artwork, including six 1/1 Neko Kings. NekoCore will serve as Jed's Genesis NFT Collection providing holders with early access to his future NFT projects. All cats and all mechas in the collection are unique.

Our team also features accomplished game developers working on the Tournament, where all Nekos will compete to win the Trophy NFTs, special gold, silver and bronze NekoCore NFT's with the lowest serial numbers #1-72. Tournaments will take place every month for 2 years. We're proud of this innovative way of adding utility by giving away some of the best pieces in the set to holders in a fun way that doesn't demand any regular clicking or other obligations. Owning a NekoCore and being a part of our community is a chill experience without obligation. No WL grinding, no vague future token, just great art and a fun tournament to check in on if you want.

We're proud of creating a well-rounded NFT Project. We feel we've combined multiple facets that in some cases would comprise the entirety of other projects. High quality generative art, mintpass for future collections, entertainment utility without a time obligation, and what is essentially a raffle ticket (via Tournament entry) for the best serial number pieces in the collection. Come check us out via the links shared above, we'd be happy to welcome you and answer any questions you may have about the project!","self","https://redd.it/tealbc"

Voting has begun and will run for 3 days. The coin with more votes will move on to the next round to play the winner of: **2. USD Coin** vs. **15. TrueUSD**

For those unfamiliar, this is modeled after March Madness where the top 64 coins face off in a single elimination tournament. The winner moves on and the loser is out. The last coin left is declared the champion.

This is UNI’s second consecutive tournament appearance. Last year, it defeated Ethereum Classic before losing to eventual runner-up Algorand in the second round. Tell your friends and maybe your frenemies; the more votes the better!

This is a real event, not spam and it’s just for fun. I know that different coins have different functions so it’s sometimes silly to ask “which is better,” but I’m still doing it because I think it’s fun. If this isn’t the type of post for this subReddit, I apologize and won’t post here again.

I've been working on a little project to compare the prices of token pairs across various liquidity pools. Besides looking at the spot price, I am looking at how much of token Y I can take out in a swap given a certain amount of token X. This is very easy to calculate on uniswap v2 (using x * y = k), but on uniswap v3 the pricing function is dependent on all the different liquidity providers and the range they are providing liquidity to.

My question to you is, is there some way of calculating a decently accurate estimate of how much I can get in a swap?

To explain: I am trying to calculate this myself without querying their contract because of the time-pressure of my project. I would rather have a good estimate very quickly than a perfect estimate that takes 2 seconds.","self","https://redd.it/tfhy1c"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock","self","https://redd.it/tflega"

Bitcoin's decentralized nature can bring a lot of convenience and even a degree of stability to countries with high inflation or crisis. For example, Venezuela has become a hotspot for Bitcoin mining and crypto payments, given that the country's hyperinflation is significantly boosting demand for Bitcoin. With 70% of the population in El Salvador lacking access to banking services, the country hopes to reduce its reliance on cross-border remittances and attract foreign investment by creating an environment for using cryptocurrencies. 

In El Salvador, cross-border remittances account for 24% of GDP. Compared to traditional remittance channels, Bitcoin can reduce cross-border transaction costs and increase the disposable income of some people. With the promotion of Bitcoin around the world, Bitcoin is gradually becoming a global asset. While some are still skeptical about Bitcoin, countries like Korea and the US are promoting blockchain industry like the Metaverse, where Bitcoin could play an important role. On Monday, members of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted in favor of a moderate regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. 

The framework is expected to promote the sustainable development of cryptocurrencies in Europe. “With the approval of the MiCA report, the European Parliament has paved the way for an innovation-friendly crypto regulation that can set global standards,” said European People's Party MEP Stefan Berger.

 Therefore, the usdt part of V3 LP is equivalent to a long leveraged ETH asset with an initial leverage of m0. 

 Similarly, we can also deduce that the ETH part of V3 LP is a short ETH leveraged asset with an initial leverage ratio of m0：

To hedge impermanent loss, X3 protocol splits uniswap V3 LP into the above long leveraged token and short leveraged token to sell to the leveraged traders.It will be a win-win for traders obtaining leveraged trading opportunities without funding fees and farmers earning LP fees with no impermanent loss risk.

After the news that [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) will sponser the FIFA World Cup 2022 I can give you my personal feedback to the company:

Crypto.com offers Visa debit cards that give 2% cashback and a range of other perks like free Spotify. This is a very big company. [They had a huge ad campaign starring Matt Damon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8) and they [bought the naming rights to the Staples Center in L.A. for 20 years](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-16/crypto-staples). Now they landed the next coup by [sponsoring the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022](https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-unveiled-as-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-official-sponsor).

They have different Visa Debit card which offer different bonuses. The Ruby Steel card tier, for example, offers a **$25 instant bonus, free Spotify and 2% cashback on all purchases.** To get this card you need to stake €350 worth of CRO coins and hold it for 6 months. After this time you're free to sell your CRO again (or keep if you want to retain the card benefits).

**Important note:** you don't need to put crypto on the card, you can just load it with Euro or USD and spend it!

All cashbacks and bonuses are paid in the CRO cryptocurrency. You can immediately sell the CRO in the app for pounds/euros, which you can use again for purchases with the card if you want.

\--

**Personal experience:**

I've been using the card for half a year now. Lost a small amount as CRO dipped a bit since then and my staked amount is worth a bit less than before. Yet I got on all purchases a 2% cashback which is currently worth $52 (over all purchases were $2600). I use the card on a regular base but I don't have many running costs. In these six months my Spotify got paid back in CRO ($12.99 each month) resulting in $77.94 cashback. Also I started staking my CRO on their DeFi Wallet with a 12.58% annual reward. As a bonus: I really like the look of the metal debit card :)

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock","self","https://redd.it/tld3wd"

Smart pools combine the best of both shared and private core pools by allowing the pool’s parameters to remain flexible while also letting any user participate as a liquidity provider. In other words, conditional investing strategies can be encoded into a smart pool. This means the factors of when, where, and what assets to allocate can be dynamically controlled. As a result, the introduction of smart pools opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for crypto lending and for managing digital assets on the Ethereum network.

I think some other AMMs do this, and I want it from UniSwap, because rigidity is not for me. Anyone that knows me understand that I love things that change with time like returns changing. 

Other aspects of the crypto space is flexible and changes. Like the rates available on Balancer changes, the returns I get from Social Good alters, and so on. We need more flexibility.

I'm here to present you my new sniping bot based on the already existing bot of ""**TradingTigers**"".

My goal is to constantly improve this bot by adding new features, like for example :

* A better ""rug check"" by taking into account the minimum taxes
* To support the ERC-20 blockchain
* To have Telegram alerts when an order is opened/closed
* Improve the performance of the initial bot

Everything will be updated on my github at this address : [https://github.com/DexSniping/DexSniping-BSC-ERC20-Telegram-Alerts](https://github.com/DexSniping/DexSniping-BSC-ERC20-Telegram-Alerts)

Whitepaper:
https://strikex.com/about-us/#document


TradeStrike Lite (V1.5)

The first of their products, TradeStrike Lite (V1.5) is now live. 

Staking is now fully functioning and you are able to stake for a variable 10-20% through the new contract. I should also point out that there is no lock in commitments so there is no reason not to stake.

The DEX now has the Buy & Swap feature enabled. This allows fast, simple & Secure purchase of crypto directly through Apple Pay, bank transfer and credit or debit card with over 180 different currencies included. This is achieved with the use of either Moonpay or Ramp. Currently BNB/STRX is the only pair available. 

The next update is the ‘Share & Earn’ feature. This allows you to refer a friend through Flooz.Trade and receive a percentage of any (STRX) trade they do - for life!

If you decide to purchase STRX after reading this, please use my referral link below!

 (http://www.flooz.trade/wallet/0xd6fdde76b8c1c45b33790cc8751d5b88984c44ec/?refId=SbB7Bz&chainId=56&fromToken=bnb)


TradeX

TradeX will be the fully functional V2 of their DEX. We were given a very impressive teaser of this which can be seen on the StrikeX YouTube channel. The update is expected to be the most comprehensive of its kind, including;

-Fiat on-ramp
-Proper charting
-Order books 
-Limit orders 
-Cross chain swaps
and much more…

The TradeX launch can be expected Q2 2022. 

You can find a demo of TradeX on their social media platforms! 

Skynet and Certik Shield 

As the leading name in crypto security, TradeStrike have not only acquired the services of Certik to audit their DEX, they will also be using their Skynet and Certik Shield services. This provides 24/7 security monitoring and insurance of any lost or stolen assets. 


StrikeX Wallet 

We are now approaching the release of the highly anticipated StrikeX DeFi Wallet. You can find a demo of this in the recent AMA 5 video, and I must say it looks great!

So far we have been told that it will be integrated with BSC, SOL, BTC, ETH blockchains which will allow cross chain swaps and multi-chain support! 

The StrikeX Wallet would be fully integrated with TradeX and contain portfolio performance tracking & charting.

The Wallet will also allow instant fiat deposits and WITHDRAWALS through the integration of BANXA payment gateway. This provides compatibility with Visa, MasterCard and ApplePay. 

This will be huge in terms of ease of use accessibility, which seems to be a large stumbling block in the crypto space. This should open up the market to many! 

In terms of security, you will be able to access to your crypto wallet swiftly and securely with their in-built biometric login.

Recently the team started accepting listing applications for the wallet, this  means they will be integrated at launch. I believe there are still a lot to come and expect the names to get bigger and bigger. This will be huge publicity for the wallet and we are already seeing an influx on new holders.


TradeStrike 

The main platform which is due for release Q4 2022 of which $STRX will be the native token. This will allow 24/7 cheap trading of crypto, stocks, NFTs & real-estate through the use of Tokenisation and blockchain technology, which is tipped to be a huge industry in the coming years. Working along side one of the biggest law firms on the planet, Latham & Watkins, to ensure regulatory compliance from the start. 

We have now been told that FCA approval was submitted late 2021, and that a lot of work has already been done on back end development.


New Appointments 

The team have really started to show their intentions with some high profile appointments in the company. 

The first of which being Rob Clark, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), who boasts an extensive background across storage, infrastructure systems, networking, security and dev-ops. 

The second being their newly appointed Chief Security Officer (CSO), Jason Butler, who has built an extensive background in cybersecurity. With a wealth of experience, Jason’s expertise has proven to be critical in architecting secure, highly scalable and resilient systems for start-ups, large enterprises, service providers and multinational distributors alike.

There has also been talk of a new business structure that is being worked on behind the scenes, this includes their very own in house Marketing and Human Resources team among more. 


StrikeX Blockchain 

Recently is was revealed that StrikeX have employed the services Thomas Smith as Blockchain Advisor to the company. Already a respected name in the crypto community and also winner of Binance Influencer of the Year 2021. 

This just highlights the vision of the project  and that there is so much more to come after the release of the main platform!

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

But deploying a liquidity mining (LM) program on V3 right now requires technical expertise and development time - it typically requires 2-3 developer weeks.

How do we solve this? Enter,[ xToken Terminal](https://xtokenterminal.io/).

Terminal is a permissionless, no-code platform that allows projects to configure and deploy V3 LM programs in a few easy clicks - with a rich UI, a configurable contract architecture, and powerful features like rewards vesting and multi-token incentives. Terminal is great for LPs as well, allowing frictionless liquidity deployment and an end-to-end experience.

I was exploring uniswap and wanted to try to become a LP provider. So far, this is what I understood and I'll be grateful to anyone who shed some light.

I'd like to provide lp for wbtc/eth as I'm not really bothered by impermanent loss in any one of those.
So using uniswap, I'll basically swap eth for wbtc and then provide liquidity. When the liquidity is provided I'll be charged whatever fees in eth for adding to the pool. Some fees will be also paid when removing my liquidity.

Now, I wanted to feel how much return I'd make with a 0.3% fee (which is the most used). From my understanding fees (found in uniswap info) are redistributed according to each one weight in the pool. So basically, if I provide 50% of all liquidity, I'll get 50% of all fees. Am I correct?
To illustrate, today with 33280 in fees for a 355 mil provided, I would get 16640 if provided 177.5 mil, which is basically 0.00926% daily or 2893% annually (considering same volume). This seems wrong to me but can't figure out why?

Are there any other aspect I need to see? 

Also, I'm don't understand the range that is used for providing liquidity. How does this affect return? 

Many Thanks!","self","https://redd.it/ttc6k4"

Even after the emergence of uniswap for a long time, no one mentioned it. However, as more and more people participate in market making, people find that as long as you participate in market making, you can’t buy back the coins you originally held. This part of the lost funds is the impermanent loss. So many people want to ask, is impermanent loss a real loss or a permanent loss? To answer this question, you still need to know the formula of impermanent loss for uniswap V2: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/utz3yxtefhr81.png?width=330&format=png&auto=webp&s=53ad819c35b1fdf8e6907aedb5d4e029d149f262

 P0 is the price tokenA/tokenB of starting liquidity farming, Pn is another price of that. 

 From the above calculation formula, it can be seen that only when P0=Pn, impermanence loss will be equal to zero. However, the above formula is based on the premise that you hold tokenA and tokenB of equal value. And In most cases, you may hold unequal assets. For example, you start to hold only one asset, then in order to make the market, firstly you must exchange one asset for another, at this time you will bear the risk of price drop and the risk of impermanent loss at the same time, so your real loss at this time = currency price drop loss + the impermanent loss of the capital pool, so impermanent loss is a part of your real loss, and it is a risk that we cannot ignore. As long as the price fluctuates, impermanent losses will become your real loss.","https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mt2yAgS7o9C-zAQqELe51NAL0MuEufmXcQnmzpNNht4.jpg","https://redd.it/tvxxcc"

Many farmers are very satisfied with the protection, but there is also a question, why does bancor not open impermanent loss protection for all pools? 

 To answer this question, first we need to carefully analyze the principle of impermanent loss protection of bancor. Let’s take ETH-BNT as an example to illustrate: 

Assuming that the liquidity provider provides 1 ETH when the ETH:BNT exchange price is 1,000, Bancor will issue 1,000 BNT equivalent to 1 ETH, and then the system will combine 1 ETH and the issued 1,000 BNT into the pool. As can be seen from Figure 1 and Table 1 the impermanent loss increases with price increasing. The impermanent loss will reach 0.75 ETH or 12,000 BNT at the price of 4000. If you exit the market at this time, you will receive 12,000 compensated to impermanent loss by Bancor, which is equivalent to your holding 1 ETH remains unchanged while earning fees with single-sided liquidity. Here you will find that bancor compensates for your impermanent losses through platform gains or additional tokens, which is equivalent to disguised damage to the interests of other holders. Of course, this method would be used to increase the transaction volume of the platform and achieve a level that does not affect the generation. Based on this principle, bancor can only provide impermanent loss protection for a limited pool like some valued coins, because the shit coins are easily manipulated to get risk-free compensation for impermanent losses from bancor. So bancor only provide impermanent loss protection for specific pools?

 However, the above solutions have more or less some defects. The first solution by token compensation damages the interests of token holders, and it is difficulty to provide impermanent loss protection for all pools. The insurance and option to hedge IL always lack of market liquidity, and it makes it difficult for the buyer of the option to exit freely. 

In order to hedge against the impermanent losses, we designed a contract system:

USDT Value of 1 Contract is sqrt(P)，

wherein P is the price of ETH. When the price of ETH to USDT is P0, a liquid mining user deposits x0 ETH and y0 USDT into the Uniswap fund pool ETH-USDT, and shorts 2y0/(P0)\^.5 contracts in the contract trading system at the same time, in other words, there is short order of 2y0 USDT. When the price of ETH/USDT fluctuates to Pn:

Meet the following conditions in Uniswap:

Then the net profit and loss of the liquid mining user for USDT is

 It can be seen from the above, the impermanent loss of liquid mining users in Uniswap is zero by using the contract system designed by us for hedging, and it is equivalent to hold a single asset for liquidity mining. In order to further verify the feasibility of the above system, we selected the ETH/USDT data from February 15, 2020 to March 13, 2020 for back testing. A liquid mining user (market maker) made funds to Uniswap ETH-USDT on February 15, 2020. The equivalent of 1000 USDT is deposited in the pool. The figure below shows the change in the amount of USDT Vs Price in Uniswap and the contract trading system of the mining user. The price of ETH has dropped from 290 USDT to 85 USDT. If the liquidity market maker is only in Uniswap while making market, the USDT loss was as high as 43% during the period. But If he chooses to hedge in the contract trading system at the same time, the total USDT remained unchanged at $1,000, which indicates that the contract trading system can completely hedge the risk of impermanent loss of the automatic market making mechanism. It truly realizes the possibility of automatic market maker hedging and a single asset mining.

 As shown in Figure below, we take the ETH/USDT data for the whole year of 2021 as an example. Assuming that the annualized rate of return of pair ETH-USD mining is 100%, the capital utilization rate in the X3 system is calculated at 50%. The actual loss of ETH for the whole year was -7.7% farming only in uniswap, while the amount of ETH in X3 stable increased by 42.8%, indicating that the X3 system can achieve stable income from single-sided farming.

As a result, we believe that X3 protocal will be a win-win for leveraged traders and farmers, one obtains a leveraged exposure of the underlying assets without the risk of liquidation and funding fees, and the other obtains stable returns without impermanent losses by single-sided AMM farming.

Until now there is no effective solution for impermanent loss(IL)，but X3 can achieve not only zero impermanent loss but also single asset yield farming.

However, facts can be eye-popping. We counted the data for the whole year of 2021 and found that you not only did not make any ETHs, but lost 7.7% of initial ETH. Isn’t the result very surprising? So why does this happen?

Let’s analyze it in detail. In order to mine, you must swap half of ETH for USDT depositing into the pool as a LP. Here you are equivalent to selling half of the high-quality assets at the low point in the crazy bull market of 2021. The farming strategy allows you to bear the risk of price up or down, but also the risk of impermanent loss. In the end, you might as well choose to hold or ETH2. 0 staking compared to providing liquidity for AMM.It is ery scary that you were exposed to both impermanent loss risk and price upside or downside risk while providing liquiding for AMM. Therefore, single-sided liquidity mining is particularly important for every farmer. For example, if you choose to provide liquidity in X3, you will get 42.8% more of initial ETH by participating in AMM mining in 2021. It is an unique solution to hedge impermanent loss and may be an important breakthrough for AMM farming. I believe it will be one of the important trends of defi2.0.

During the rapid development of defi, a number of technical solutions have emerged to solve this problem, such as options represented by Opyn, insurance solutions represented by Instaraise, and bancor by BNT compensation for IL. Recently we found that some projects try to solve the impermanent loss problem through the oracle. However, after careful research, we found that these schemes do not have a deep understanding of impermanence loss. The essential reason of impermanence loss is that the AMM pool must sell low buy high to provide liquidity during the process of price movement. Can sell high buy low be achieved through the oracle machine? **Of course the answer is No.** For example, the following picture is the test data of some project.

 The test data shows that the pool did not incur much IL during A and C. They think that the pool was mainly selling SOL because the price of oracle, which mainly comes from CEXs and traders (via Pyth), always moves faster than constant product AMMs, so it was sold in advance. However, as we all know, the oracle is not a forecasting machine, any oracle is a reaction of historical prices, and there is no inevitable causal relationship between future market trends and the oracle. It can be that cex leads dex, or dex leads cex. No one can be a prophet. If they can, then the market will lose the meaning of existence.","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/l9QcyrmKdRAj1S4Gsdms52yHOmPeVJfr5UZFEwDjztY.jpg","https://redd.it/tvykio"

Is there impermanent loss for the strategy adding liquidity pool a few times at different price points and quit liquidity at one point of the different price points.

Somebody ask me a interesting question that “I added to a liquidity pool a few times at different price points… I’m having trouble coming up with an exit strategy. Say for example I added 100k at 0.05, 100k at 0.04 and 100k at .03…. I would want to exit the pool at .04 to have little to no impermanent loss?”

The question is very good. Maybe many people think it is a strategy to reduce impermanent loss because of adding lower price to reduce liquidity cost. However, this view is a misunderstanding of impermanent loss.

As we all know, the calculation formula of impermanent loss is:

&#x200B;

If you added 100k at 0.05 for the position 1, 100k at 0.04 for the position 2 and 100k at .03 for the position 3…. I would want to exit the pool at .04.

So your total impermanent loss= il1+ il2+ il3 <0, obviously you will suffer impermanent losses.

This is a very interesting phenomenon. Any new adding liquidity behavior can not reduce the impermanent losses. But what can we do to reduce impermanence losses for this strategy?

Here is a strategy to achieve it. After you added 100k at 0.05, 100k at 0.04 and 100k at .03,and then exit 100k at 0.05, 100k at 0.04 and 100k at .03 respectively. For this situation,

So your total impermanent loss= il1+ il2+ il3 =0

 As a result, you can achieve zero impermanence loss with the above strategy. Of course you can also achieve zero impermanent loss and single asset yield farming by our X3 protocol

Additionally, all liquidity deposits on those exchanges “cover” the full price range of the two assets in the pool, meaning that the AMM formula would serve up a price if token0 approached  an infinite value relative to token1 and, similarly, if token1  approached an infinite value relative to token0.

Uniswap V3 is now the dominant DEX, owing largely to its more expressive functionality. But with a richer feature-set comes greater complexity. One major casualty of Uniswap V3 is that liquidity mining now requires a profound technical expertise. Even launching an incentive on the full  price range — the most common approach to Uni V3 LM to date — still necessitates a degree of complexity.

Fear not, Web3-projects-looking-to-incentivize-Uniswap-V3-liquidity. A variety of teams are hard at work building solutions to simplify this process. Naturally, the team building xToken Terminal believes we’ve built the most secure, complete and powerful solution. However, we’ll still run through all the options that are out there in order to provide  you with the most complete set of information.

&#x200B;

[A basic summary of the feature sets for different Uniswap V3 liquidity mining options](https://preview.redd.it/6f5rtfprkzr81.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=11be58570e82b698b0c192893edbb454d57bef26)

## xToken Terminal

Terminal is our new capital markets platform, designed to provide DeFi/NFT projects — and whoever else! — seamless and permissionless access to fundamental on-chain primitives. The first of these primitives is Uniswap V3 liquidity mining. Via Terminal, a Web3 project can have a [Uni V3 LM program up and running in a few minutes](https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/terminal/mining/create-pool). No dev work or Uniswap expertise required.

Pool sponsors select a liquidity pool and price range to incentivize, one or more rewards token(s) to pay out to LPs and an optional vesting period on rewards. Once the liquidity/rewards pool is deployed, sponsors can initiate a rewards program for any amount over any period. Once a rewards program ends, sponsors can initialize a new one. Sponsors never need to leave the Terminal UI.

Similarly, LPs never need to leave the Terminal UI. LPs do not need to mint an NFT position (the sponsor mints a communal NFT on pool deployment) or navigate to alternative UIs to deposit liquidity pool tokens. Data on staked balances, APR, pool history, etc are all generated permissionlessly and viewable on the Terminal interface.

Terminal is available on L1, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.

## Gelato (G-Uni)

Similarly to Terminal, Gelato also provides a fungible interface for a non-fungible Uniswap V3 liquidity position. While Gelato does not actively rebalance liquidity positioning, the protocol provides a  manager role on their contracts that allows a representative of a project to actively re-position if desired.

Gelato/G-Uni does not provide any infrastructure for staking rewards, rewards  vesting or rewards data. Projects using G-Uni tokens for liquidity  mining will need to deploy/configure smart contracts and build a custom frontend.

## UniswapV3Staker

The UniswapV3Staker contract is the most “native” option available to projects looking to sponsor a liquidity mining program. The contract requires LPs to mint a Uni V3 NFT position and then deposit it. Rewards are paid out as a function of in-range liquidity, i.e. the more trading volume your position helps generate, the more rewards you will earn. This approach may be the most rooted in precision, but in practice it has been [marred by manipulation](https://medium.com/@revert_finance/onetickdao-eth-and-the-narrow-rangers-f9a376f7f0c9) as well as a bevy of UX challenges. It also requires deep Uniswap V3 knowledge to fully understand. Lastly, we’re not aware of a full-feature UI for projects that wish to use the UniswapV3Staker contract.

Some community members have proposed a few modifications to the contract — notably a change that requires LPs to cover a minimum price tick range. This change is likely to mitigate some or all of the issues related to manipulation of rewards, however, it is unlikely to allay any UX challenges.

## Charm

Charm’s Alpha vaults rely on some of the most clever Uniswap V3 liquidity management logic that can be found in the space. Charm’s vaults rebalance in a way that avoids a direct swapping of assets, instead relying on single-sided pseudo-limit orders — a Uniswap V3 hallmark.

>Sidenote: many Uni V3 liquidity managers underestimate the slippage costs and gas costs of active rebalancing strategies, thus overestimating the expected value of a rebalance. Maximizing capital efficiency at a given moment does not necessarily lead to maximization of value.

Charm is soon to release a permissionless version of their vaults (Alpha  Pro). It remains to be seen whether their approach, which is well-tested and successful on high liquidity pairs like ETH<>USDC, will be performant — programmatically or otherwise — on long tail pools.

At launch, Alpha Pro will not offer the smart contract or user interface architecture for native liquidity mining.

## Gamma

Gamma pursues a more active rebalancing strategy, relying at least partially on off-chain logic that is not transparent to LPs. Though decentralization advocates may protest, there may be something to be  said for this more obscured approach, as purely on-chain rebalance strategies may be vulnerable to front-running or other forms of value extraction. Gamma is in the midst of remodeling their approach to liquidity management, so some elements of this description may no longer be accurate.

Gamma pools are not permissionless and there is no native liquidity mining architecture.

# A Note on Rebalancing

We at xToken have been demo-ing our new platform for a variety of projects in the space. We’ve been excited by the positive feedback we’ve received on the platform’s ease-of-use, configurability and  extensibility.

Several projects have asked us why we don’t offer the ability to rebalance  positioning in a pool. As the product currently operates, pool sponsors must set a price range at deployment and are unable to modify that price range (although deploying a new pool with new price range takes only a few minutes). While we are exploring methods of introducing this functionality, we believe that offering a rebalance feature on a permissionless platform like ours could expose our users to frontrunning and other forms of value extraction.

Why is that? We have experience with Uni V3 repositioning from our time managing [xU3LP](https://medium.com/xtoken/introducing-xu3lp-fungible-yield-f151c747131b), which for several months, was the largest provider of managed Uniswap V3 liquidity. It turns out that rebalancing must be executed very carefully, especially when the position in question is responsible for the lion’s share of liquidity on the Uniswap pair (this concentration of pool ownership is likely the case for many LM programs). In carefully researching management strategies for xU3LP, we witnessed many instances of LP rebalances being front-run by bots on-chain. In short, rebalancing large Uniswap V3 positions requires a level of expertise and sophistication uncommon in the space.

Cake Defi is a decentralized finance platform based in Singapore, utilising the Defichain blockchain which is secured by anchoring with the btc blockchain. Cake Defi offer a very generous $40 sign-up bonus, paid instantly as DFI (Defichain), for anybody who deposits $50. Additional you can take a quiz and earn $5 of DFI and $5 of BTC. This does not require any additional transactions or trades, just **a deposit which you will be able to instantly withdraw** if you need to.

[Referral-Link to get the $50 Bonus](https://app.cakedefi.com/?ref=571562)

[Non-Ref Link (no Bonus)](https://app.cakedefi.com/)

1. Sign-up to Cake Defi using the referral link and ensure that there is the information: *""Referral code has been applied* ***571562***\*""\* to ensure you receive the bonus.
2. Verify your identity using photo ID. This used to take up to 72 hours, but should be much faster for most of the time.
3. *Deposit $50*. There is a limited number of currencies that can be used and if you are planning to withdraw your deposit instantly I would strongly recommend DASH as it has the lowest withdrawal fees. Bitcoin Cash has the next lowest withdrawal fee, followed by Doge and then Litecoin. I suggest checking the withdrawal fee page before signing up to see which suits you best.
4. Once your deposit has been received, your *sign-up bonus of $40* will be paid into your account instantly. This will be staked and locked for 180 days however it does earn interest during that time, currently around **35% APY!** Go to the freezer section and turn off auto-renew if you will want to withdraw after 180 days.
5. The DASH, or whatever you deposited, can be immediately withdrawn to wherever it was deposited from and if necessary, exchanged to GBP and withdrawn to your bank account.
6. After 180 days, withdraw your bonus along with the interest it has accrued. Obviously you are able to do Liquidity Mining on CakeDefi.
7. Do the Learn Lesson and get $5 of DFI and another $5 of BTC.

I have been really impressed with Cake and Defichain as a whole. I invested a bit more than the $50 and due to Liquidity Mining it already gave a nice bonus which I really apprechiate. I am now using the Freezer on Cake Defi to stake more DFI over a much longer timeframe than the initial 6 months as the APY is fantastic, the longer timeframes gives discounts on fees and I can see the value of the coin appreciating over the next few years.

Cake do have other opportunities to earn interest on your crypto using their liquidity pools or via lending. BTC, ETH, BCH, DOGE, LTC and USDT all have good APRs, just keep an eye on the withdrawal fees for BTC, ETH and USDT to ensure you stake enough or for long enough to make it worth your while.

For anybody struggling with buying DASH, it can be purchased at Bitpanda as previously mentioned, but also Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex and Kucoin. Deposit/withdrawal fees and methods across these exchanges vary.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus.

**ZenGo Supports WalletConnect**

ZenGo is the first consumer-focused Web3 crypto wallet powered by multiparty computation (MPC), eliminating private key vulnerabilities, ensuring on-chain user control, and simplifying secure account recovery.

ZenGo, the world’s leading simple & secure [crypto wallet app](http://www.zengo.com/) powered by multiparty computation (MPC) technology, announces support for the WalletConnect protocol on the Ethereum blockchain – becoming the first multi-chain Web3 crypto wallet with account phishing protection and seamless wallet recoverability.

Every week, countless users lose funds because of private key phishing attacks via emails and social networks. In an industry first, ZenGo’s MPC technology and 5 unique patents offer a secure bridge to Web3: from NFTs and DeFi to gaming and Dapps, by eliminating seed phrases and private keys from the wallet experience. Leveraging ZenGo’s MPC security, users cannot compromise their own assets because of the usual pitfalls caused by private keys and poor key management. If the phone storing the wallet gets lost or stolen, ZenGo’s wallet recovery kit ensures stressless recovery, thanks to multi-factor biometric recovery.

ZenGo’s move to support the Web3 ecosystem will make it simpler and safer for crypto-native and crypto-curious users to mint, trade, store NFTs, get yield in DeFi, enjoy decentralized games, contribute to DAOs, and more.

According to ZenGo Co-founder and CEO Ouriel Ohayon, *“ZenGo is committed to offering a uniquely human and zen user experience in an industry that is still chaotic, complicated, and confusing. To onboard the next 1 billion, we need products that provide a delightful, simple, and secure user experience. ZenGo’s integration with WalletConnect is a massive step forward for Web3 adoption and crypto as a whole.”*

Until now, Web3 was only accessible via traditional, non-custodial wallets: complicated, confusing, difficult and risky to recover, and challenging to secure. ZenGo’s WalletConnect integration on Ethereum offers seamless access to Web3, opening the door to anyone who wants to participate in NFT and DeFi without the risks of private key management and unreliable wallet recovery.

Please check if my assumptions are right:

1) For a position in a USDC/wETH pool if the price of ETH declines below the low of the concentrated liquidity range the pool becomes equal to a 100% position in wETH? And if the same happens to the upside the pool is 100% USDC?

The so-called swap widget, which can be added by pasting in a line of code, will let OpenSea users swap various tokens without leaving the website that runs it. The widget will also be initially available on the sites Oasis.app and Friends With Benefits. 

PayPal Holdings Inc. used such a tactic decades ago to expand its reach and spur the growth of online commerce, said Richard Crone, the head of Crone Consulting LLC. In the cryptocurrency industry, however, such widgets are less pervasive, with Coinbase Global Inc. among those that provide them for certain functions.

“We believe that value exchange is essential to Web3,” which is a slew of apps using tokens and blockchains, Mary-Catherine Lader, chief operating officer at Uniswap, said in an interview.

This is good for the entire web3 ecosystem and related projects like Deedy, Helium, and The Graph. “To grow, we have to grow the whole market,” Mary-Catherine Lader commented further.

Uniswap Chief Executive Officer Hayden Adams founded the New York-based decentralized exchange after losing his job as a mechanical engineer at Siemens AG in 2017. Since then, Uniswap has come to dominate decentralized spot trading on Ethereum, with only dydx, which focuses on crypto derivatives, having higher trading volumes, according to CoinMarketCap. Currently, Uniswap’s trading volume is similar to FTX, a major centralized spot exchange, according to CoinMarketCap.

Unlike most traditional crypto exchanges, Uniswap protocol doesn’t charge issuers to list new tokens, generating revenue instead through transaction fees that go to liquidity providers.","self","https://redd.it/u5h02i"

On Thursday, the business stated, ""We envision a world in which everyone has access to fair, open, and transparent marketplaces."" ""The Swap Widget brings this vision closer to reality by allowing developers to simply embed Uniswap exchanging functionality within their apps, allowing users to seamlessly trade tokens, join a community or DAO, wrap assets, and more without ever leaving their apps.""

The Swap Widget has a customized user interface, and it ""bundles Uniswap Labs' Auto Router to discover the cheapest price across Uniswap v2 + v3 token pools"" for pricing. Layer two (L2) chains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism and are likewise connected to the widget. The Swap Widget is already available in a number of popular Web3 applications, according to Uniswap, including Oasis.app, Friends With Benefits, and Opensea, a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.

As of Thursday, the widget is fully functional and can be embedded into a Web3 application using Uniswap's developer documentation. Swap Widget users who want to ask questions or seek technical support should join the group's Discord channel. With $1.11 billion in 24-hour volume, Uniswap v3 had the highest trading volume out of a bevy of dex protocols at the time of writing.

•	Third-party (Broker) who facilitates fund transactions will soon be replaced.
•	The blockchain will adopt a decentralized approach with simple, yet more advanced technology. This may lead to more risks involved and an increase in fraud, especially in a large volume of individual transactions. 
•	You can purchase a digital asset quickly but you might not be able to get a refund without a broker or third party to guarantee the transaction.

Solutions that ROBO INU FINANCE is trying to build.

•	@RoboInuFinance will build a platform to ensure fairness as well as reliability between the digital asset transactions amongst individuals through an integrated smart contract.
•	This platform will also be able to facilitate the transfer of cross-border funds.
•	Individuals can leverage blockchain innovation to convert cryptocurrency into cash.
•	Transfer money to their loved ones who reside in different countries and continents.
•	Buyers & Sellers will work together using smart contracts built on the Robo Inu Finance platform where fraud in the cryptocurrency world or payment gateway will be eliminated. 

The ecosystem. 

•	#RoboWallet – A personal wallet that has the ability to store all currencies, also has the ability to bridge different cross-chain networks with the lowest fee, the ability to cross-border fund transfer and the ability to hold collectibles. 
•	#RoboLaunchpad – An incubator for potential projects with real user cases. All these projects are checked and moderated by the Robo Inu Finance team comprised of ex-google developers and individuals with more than 10 years of experience in the world of cryptocurrency. There is a guarantee that no scam projects will be released on the Robolauncpad.
•	#RoboNFTMarketplace – A high-valued digital asset exchange which has daily auctions (NFT products) integrated with the RoboWallet where you can own  any digital asset value with just a click of a mouse.

Uniswap, according to the complaint, has no entry barriers for users who want to trade or swap crypto tokens on the platform. It does not need identification verification or a ""know-your-customer"" (KYC) process, resulting in widespread fraud. Other allegations are that Uniswap offered and sold unregistered securities throughout the United States on its exchange without registering as a national securities exchange or as a broker-dealer and without there being any registration statements in effect for the tokens it was selling, all in violation of applicable law.

The defendants would have received necessary and meaningful disclosures if the tokens had been registered as required, allowing them to reliably assess the issuers' representations and the riskiness of their investments, but they were left to fend for themselves and subject to rampant fraud without these disclosures, according to the complaint.

Prominent decentralized exchange Uniswap accounts for almost 50% of the market share on the Ethereum layer 2 aggregator – Polygon. It managed to achieve this feat only three months after its deployment on the Polygon network.

The company behind the popular DeFi protocol, Uniswap Labs, tweeted, citing data provided by Dune Analytics, which showed a market share of 49.5 percent on Polygon. Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic first proposed deploying Uniswap v3 in November of last year, and it received enormous support with over 72 million UNI tokens offered as a vote. 

The DEX saw its network expand the following month, causing its native token, MATIC, to appreciate in value.

Uniswap has maintained its 71 percent market share in the world of DEXes despite losing market share in recent months. Its trade volume was approximately $10 billion in the previous week. Curve, SushiSwap, and Balancer, among others, are lagging behind, according to Dune Analytics. Uniswap's tally of unique addresses traded, maker, and taker within the previous seven days was 93.265k.

By routing trades across both Uniswap v2 and v3 pools, Uniswap's newest version included an upgraded Auto Router that intended to improve price as well as optimize the gas cost of swaps. The ultimate goal is to allow consumers to track the full cost of a swap in real-time, right from the App interface. In addition to lowering gas prices, the new edition aimed to find the best pricing across all Uniswap protocols. 

Last week, Uniswap Labs announced the release of the Swap Widget, a platform that allows developers and operators of decentralized apps (dapps) to incorporate the Uniswap DEX app with ""one line of code."" Developers would be able to integrate Uniswap into their third-party programs as a result of this.

The Swap Widget functionality was launched on popular Web 3 apps such as – OpenSea, Friends With Benefits, and Oasis.app.
In a bid to further advance its engagement in the Web 3 sector, Uniswap also unveiled its venture arm earlier this month. Called Uniswap Labs Ventures, the company revealed that it intends to focus on emerging Web 3 projects at different stages and levels.","self","https://redd.it/uaa78k"

ETH/SHIB pair, if everyone were to all the sudden only be trading SHIB for ETH instead of say, SHIB for USDC

Would you be getting a much better deal by trading your ETH for SHIB, rather than USDC for SHIB, in that scenario?

AKA huge demand for trading SHIB to ETH and way less demand for trading SHIB for USDC.

Would the USDC value of SHIB be affected by the huge demand on the ETH/SHIB pair? Or are these completely separate with no AMM link between them?

I’m trying to understand if in a scenario like this, would it be better to trade the ETH (or whatever the high demand coin is) for SHIB (or whatever the lesser demand coin is) or if trading something like USDC (or any other stablecoin) for the SHIB would be the same.

Uniswap is taking steps to ensure that unlawful monies are not exchanged on its platform. The company has already begun blocking addresses associated with ""banned activity,"" and will use data from TRM Labs, a blockchain research startup focused on detecting unlawful activities, to apply a filter.
 Uniswap describes what kind of activity it intends to keep out of its services stated that only wallets related with blatantly illegal activities, such as sanctions, terrorism financing, hacked or stolen cash, ransomware, human trafficking, or child sexual abuse content, will be blocked. 

Users who believe they have been flagged in error, can    appeal to the platform and see if the blockage may be lifted.

A huge portion of the bitcoin community reacted badly to the news, but it is consistent with what other decentralized finance firms have done in terms of compliance. Using an oracle contract offered by blockchain security firm Chainalysis, Tornado cash, one of the most popular mixing protocols, is now restricting transactions from Ethereum addresses classified as sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control.


This is no doubt in my opinion a welcome development  for the  blockchain ecosystem has it as for long a time been associated with illegalities.
Bitcoin which will no doubt always be associated with Slik Road an illegal marketplace which adopted  it as it's legal tender, no  paved the way for other platforms such as Ethereum, Binance, Cardano and newer and exciting projects like Luckyblock which is adigital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology, Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses, Faith tribe which is a platform  for creating trading, distribution, and monetization of designs of fashion. 
If the blockchain ecosystem can be dis-associated with illegal activities to the bearest  minimum, this would allow it to fully thrive and give way to a lot more interesting projects.
 Adoption of similar measures by other platforms would no doubt encourage adoption by government institutions thereby making it mainstream and accelerating the growth of blockchain and cryptocurrencies as we know it.","self","https://redd.it/ud2ahw"

The company has already begun blocking addresses tied to ""prohibited activity"" and will utilize data from TRM Labs, a blockchain analysis startup that focuses on detecting unlawful activities, to apply a filter. 

Uniswap Examines All Addresses That Interact With Its Frontend 
The decentralized finance exchange, Uniswap, has taken steps to prevent unlawful activities on its platform. The exchange has now implemented address filtering mechanisms that use its official frontend to log the addresses. TRM Labs, a blockchain firm that provides transaction monitoring services, compares these addresses to a blacklist.

While the scope of these procedures is unknown, Uniswap describes what kind of activity it intends to keep out of its services in its address-screening FAQ. It reads: 

Only wallets related with blatantly illegal activities, such as sanctions, terrorism financing, hacked or stolen cash, ransomware, human trafficking, or child sexual abuse content, will be blocked (CSAM). 

The pool of addresses that will be restricted from accessing the exchange's official frontend has not been disclosed, and it is unclear whether it will be in the future.

Despite the fact that these additional measures were only introduced last week, some users have already indicated that they have been impacted. When users attempt to trade currencies using a blacklisted address, they are greeted with the following message: 

Because it is linked to one or more blocked activities, this address is blocked in the Uniswap Labs interface. 

The Uniswap Labs team leaves an open door for users who believe they have been flagged in error, allowing them to report their instances and see if the blockage may be lifted.

A huge portion of the bitcoin community reacted badly to the news, but it is consistent with what other decentralized finance firms have done in terms of compliance. Using an oracle contract offered by blockchain security firm Chainalysis, Tornado.cash, one of the most popular mixing protocols, is now restricting transactions from Ethereum addresses classified as sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). 

Users pointed out that blacklisted addresses can overcome this by using different frontends or directly interacting with Uniswap or Tornado.cash contracts.","self","https://redd.it/udwk6n"

Uniswap Labs, the firm behind the Ethereum-based decentralized exchange Uniswap, has created a venture arm to invest in Web 3 ideas, according to a blog post published Monday.

Aave, Compound Protocol, and MakerDAO are among the 11 crypto ventures in which Uniswap has previously funded. According to a public blog post, the venture unit's goal will extend ""from infrastructure to developer tools to consumer-facing products.""
The trend of crypto firms investing in Web 3 entities other than themselves continues with Uniswap Lab Ventures. Circle Ventures Fund was founded in November by stablecoin issuer Circle, and FTX Ventures was launched in January by crypto exchange FTX with a $2 billion fund.
The amount of capital in Uniswap's venture fund was not disclosed.

I think is a welcome development and a step in the right Direction. The crypto ecosystem system has undergone tremendous growth in recent years, establishing a thriving community. This was not achieved without platforms reinvesting in the crypto community and related wed 3 entities. This has made the  creation  of new and innovative projects such as PancakeSwap a decentralized  exchange allows users to buy and sell digital tokens without going through a third party, Faith tribe which is a platform for creating trading, distribution, and monetization of designs of fashion, Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology feasible.

DAOs are based on tokens. Examples of tokens are AXS and SOLIS.  Why it matters: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) provide an alternate mechanism for people to organize action toward common goals. It's a mix of democracy and oligarchy, and it's in flux. It helps to understand how they work in order to answer the question above.   Driving the news: This week on Uniswap, we are seeing a crucial DAO decision. The industry's foremost automated market maker (a robot on the internet who is always looking for a trade) is currently working on a plan that would move it for the first time onto a non-Ethereum blockchain.  At this stage, the proposal, authored by the student group Blockchain at Michigan, is unlikely to fail.  There is no one method to do things. Some DAOs are more formal than others. Some members have higher expectations of them. However, the way Uniswap operates is representative.   It is necessary to discuss each given concept in a variety of online media in order to evaluate community support and develop the idea.  There are two votes, but one of them is a shambles, effectively a sound-check. The most crucial one necessitates both a majority of support and a minimum level of engagement (a quorum).  This is where things get strange: Uniswap is governed by the uni token. The total number of unis in circulation is 691 million. People vote with their tokens, therefore some people have more votes than others. Some people even assign their unis to other people.   The quorum is set at 40 million uni. There are currently 59,555,937 uni votes in favor and 1,470 votes against. So it has cleared quorum and the votes are overwhelmingly in favor.  The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which owns 13.5 million uni, was the largest single voter. However, many people who only attended one university voted.","self","https://redd.it/uegsfb"

Uniswap, a prominent DeFi exchange, has been integrated onto the carbon-negative Proof-of-Stake blockchain Celo. 
Uniswap will use Celo to construct ""green asset liquidity pools"" that will use tokenized carbon credits. 
The decision will also provide $10 million in cash incentives to Uniswap customers and assist Uniswap in reaching mobile consumers. This will have it emulate green efficient blockchain projects like Plastiks and Hydrominer 

Following a community vote that ended on April 29, the popular DeFi exchange Uniswap has been deployed to Celo.

The vote this week was decisively in favor of implementing Uniswap on Celo, with 99.7 percent of votes in favor. 
The remaining 0.3 percent of votes were cast in abstention. There were almost no votes specifically against launching on Celo. 

The voting attracted about 500 addresses. With 13.5 million votes, the venture capital company Andreesen Horowitz (a16z) had 1.35 percent of the voting power. 

A number of academic institutes were also involved in the project. The University of Michigan was responsible for the first proposal and participated in the vote. Blockchain teams from UCLA, UC Berkeley, the University of Pennsylvania, and Columbia University all participated.

Those votes from university blockchain groups represented 1.7% of all votes—or 17.2 million votes in absolute terms.

Though Uniswap is primarily an exchange for Ethereum-based assets, it has also been converted to a number of other Ethereum-compatible platforms, including Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. 

The proposal to add Uniswap to Celo has been under consideration since March, for a variety of reasons. 
Celo's energy efficiency was one of the key motivators. Celo is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain with a carbon offset fund. Uniswap intends to capitalize on this by creating ""green asset liquidity pools"" utilizing tokenized carbon credits. 
The idea also calls for Celo to rebalance its reserve with green assets without relying on centralized markets.

On the user side, the proposal will provide $10 million in financial incentives to Uniswap users, supported by grants from the Celo Foundation. Celo's mobile-first approach will also assist Uniswap in targeting its platform to the world's 6 billion smartphone consumers. 

According to DeFiPulse data, Uniswap is the fifth-largest DeFi platform, with $7 billion in locked value.
Celo, on the other hand, is a minor blockchain. CELO, its native asset, has a market valuation of $1.1 billion, ranking it in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by that metric.","self","https://redd.it/uftgth"

Q1

  I made LP token from DEX A and I was able to stake that LP token at DEX B. Every DEX encourages people to stake their LP token at their own DEX(So called LP mining). In return they reward people with their own token or something.I thoght if LP token can be used across DEXes it should be standardized and that means there should be some kind of joint central reserves for a LP and regardless of staking at a certain DEX, trade fees should be accrued and distributed when I break my LP. 

Am I getting something wrong?

&#x200B;

Q2

How LP amount is calculated? For example, I created a SHIT/USDT pool for the first time. I put 100 SHIT and 100USDT because I thoght 1SHIT is worth 1dollor and for creating LP I got 10 SHIT-USDT LP token and SHIT Price changed now there are 50 SHIT and 200USDT (costant product)in the pool. Somebody else wants to add liquIdity for the pool. he put 5SHIT and 40USDT. How LP amount he will get is caculated? From my understanding he is now  putting 10percent value of the pool. Since value should be always 50/50 I can just pick SHIT or USDT and how much portion he will take up after adding liquidity. He will get 1 LP token since I have 10 LP token and he is one tenth of my postion

&#x200B;

Q3

 when I create a pool I am the only one so I will get whatever the LP token amount and later on other people will get LP token based on there share of the pool. What I want to know is how much LP token I get when I create a pool even though It doesnt have any affect for LP to work properly. Just out of curiosity. Because some LPs have very small total supply and some have very large supply

I'm working on a project adding some features described in this paper to a Uniswap-like codebase: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.09872.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.09872.pdf).

The main confusion I'm facing is that the paper describes the ""state"" of an AMM as follows:

>An AMM in state (x, y) has custody x units of asset X, and y units of asset Y , subject to the invariant that the product xy = c.

Is there a way for a trader to access x and y (the units of assets X and Y in the pool)?

From looking at the code, it seems like the only place this information is stored is in v3-core/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol, in the variable uint128 public override liquidity. But my understanding (this may be wrong) is that traders only interact with v3-periphery, and LPs interact with v3-core.

tl;dr Does the liquidity variable in v3-core tell me how many units of an asset is in the pool? (If not, do you know which might)? Thank you so much.","self","https://redd.it/uho9w4"

1 - question about the v2 factory contract [https://etherscan.io/address/0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f) so, on etherscan it says that there are 1008 transactions made to this contract, mostly **create pair** well, if I go to **read contract** and type 1009 in **AllPairs** it returns this address 0xdeCC8EA4d01547144D0F3b1054F36EA6Ea6e4c58 how is this possible? the number of pairs are supposed to be less than the numbers of transactions made to the contract, since one transaction can create one and only one pair right? was there a migration or sum?

2 - question about the v2 factory contract (polygon)

this is the contract  
[https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5757371414417b8C6CAad45bAeF941aBc7d3Ab32#code](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5757371414417b8C6CAad45bAeF941aBc7d3Ab32#code)

I have recently deployed my own ERC-20 Token. But when I try to create a Liquidity Pool for it, My transaction is only approved, and no token, regardless of whether I use V2 or V3 LPs, is minted. I assume it is because adding Eth liquidity requires another transaction. Nevertheless, I want to know (1) what happened to the eth I spend on the approve transaction; (2) since I want to prefund my project using a presale ICO, how can I, as the developer of the token, make sure that other token holders are not the creator of the initial LP, and thus set the price for my token. since the transaction fee is shown to be +$1000, I cannot currently add liquidity to the token I have only managed to verify.","self","https://redd.it/uj3n47"

Help","None",0.67,1,0,0,7,0,"So recently I learned that my old metamask wallet has been compromised. Every time I bought and transferred ETH to my metamask wallet it would automatically be sent to another address and my metamask wallet would always end up with 0 ETH tokens regardless of how much I bought.

Anyways, I created a new metamask wallet and everything, however, when I go to uniswap I cannot find a way to connect my new MM wallet to it. Uniswap is automatically connected to my old MM wallet for some reason and I can't seem to find a way to disconnect it. I even went back to my old MM wallet on chrome and viewed the ""connected sites"", however, it is not even connected to anything according to it. I have a bad feeling this is connected to the same scam. What can I do at this point? I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling MM but nothing works. Even when I have MM uninstall, it's still showing on uniswap that it is connected to my contract address but it says ""connected with Injected"" this time.","self","https://redd.it/ujhzse"

Q1

I made LP token from DEX A and I was able to stake that LP token at DEX B. Every DEX encourages people to stake their LP token at their own DEX(So called LP mining). In return they reward people with their own token or something.I thoght if LP token can be used across DEXes it should be standardized and that means there should be some kind of joint central reserves for a LP and regardless of staking at a certain DEX, trade fees should be accrued and distributed when I break my LP.

Am I getting something wrong?

Q2

How LP amount is calculated? For example, I created a SHIT/USDT pool for the first time. I put 100 SHIT and 100USDT because I thoght 1SHIT is worth 1dollor and for creating LP I got 10 SHIT-USDT LP token and SHIT Price changed now there are 50 SHIT and 200USDT (costant product)in the pool. Somebody else wants to add liquIdity for the pool. he put 5SHIT and 40USDT. How LP amount he will get is caculated? From my understanding he is now putting 10percent value of the pool. Since value should be always 50/50 I can just pick SHIT or USDT and how much portion he will take up after adding liquidity. He will get 1 LP token since I have 10 LP token and he is one tenth of my postion

Q3

when I create a pool I am the only one so I will get whatever the LP token amount and later on other people will get LP token based on there share of the pool. What I want to know is how much LP token I get when I create a pool even though It doesnt have any affect for LP to work properly. Just out of curiosity. Because some LPs have very small total supply and some have very large supply

The latest version of Uniswap allows traders to execute large-size trade in their own preferred price range compared to other popular Ether trading platforms on the centralized exchanges.

According to new research the main developer of their exchange was found. The research uses a metric called market depth (a common method to weigh liquidity on exchanges) to compare liquidity across the Uniswap v3 and the centralized exchanges, shows how much one asset can be traded for another asset for a specific price level. According to research a trader who executes a single $5-million trade (Ether/USD) will save up to $24,000 on the Uniswap v3 than in Coinbase.

Data from Coingecko reads that Uniswap v3 is the largest decentralized exchange by its trading volume with over $1.7 billion worth of digital assets exchange within 24hrs. Although, Binance is the largest centralized crypto exchange with over $22.2 billion in the trading volume the same period while Coinbase logged $3.1 billion in trading volume same period.

Dan Robinson, said that this liquidity is exceeding even the major centralized players, illustrating how smoothly crypto and other global market players like Kraken, Binance, Plastiks, etc. are adapting to the new innovation in decentralization.","self","https://redd.it/ulxqeh"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock","self","https://redd.it/ungkbd"

When I go into uniswap, properly connect my wallet, for some reaon it says the balance of my FUN tokens are .0000005971, when my balance is actually 5971. (Uniswap does properly show my eth balance). It shows 5971 in MetaMask, as well as Binance (and showed the value at around 65$) when it was in there.

When I try to input a correct value into the FUN area, it gives me an ETH value of 3.96, its a weird bug for sure.

So intead, I placed the ETH value into the ETH box on the bottem, and managed to get it to show 5971 tokens for .023 ETH. After I did a token approval transaction, the glitch is still there and when I try to swap the FUN, it tells me the value of the transaction is 0$ eth.

This makes me concered that it wont swap properly, is this normal?

Edit: some typos/format

SOLVED

Double Edit: Support in discord helped me fix it (Ty La), turns out CMC had the decimal wrong, and readding it with the token address in the main coin search worked (not the token list>>custom token area, the place I tried). Leaving this for future FUN swappers, hope this helps you","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4CSw_sUlNw9x4sEpgvzOIGDcZ--SIU_VAcglSJJlZrI.jpg","https://redd.it/ups24b"

In order to hedge against impermanent loss, X3 protocol decomposes uniswap V3 LP into a long leveraged token and a short leveraged token. Are they the same for X3 long token and X3 short token compared to tokenA and tokenB of uniswap V3? The answer is of course no. Although they all use the same underlying logic, there are some differences in the details:

Firtstly. the x3 long token and x3 short token exist independently, while tokenA and tokenB of uniswap V3 LP are not independent, and the following equations need to be satisfied:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u3ylv8v7zkz81.png?width=165&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6df1c3d8ae1873162b950a2d09e6d9584b463b

 Secondly. The price range of x3 long token and x3 short token is theoretically (0,∞), while the price range of uniswap V3 LP is (Pa,Pb). 

 Thirdly. The leverage of x3 long token and x3 short token is theoretically (0,∞), while the leverage range of uniswap V3 LP is 

https://preview.redd.it/6jq97xqbzkz81.png?width=205&format=png&auto=webp&s=8330871078d6917abb092f7077ca2748fc38cfaa

 that is, the minimum leverage of V3 is limited at:

https://preview.redd.it/bkcwjspfzkz81.png?width=169&format=png&auto=webp&s=279ab13335e375646bab649b258558baa00b37fc

 

however x3 leveraged token does not have above limitations. ∞ means the leveraged token is liquidated.

Therefore, the underlying technology of x3 leveraged token and uniswap V3 LP token is the same, but x3 long token and x3 short token have a wider scope of application, which can not only solve the problem of impermanent loss, but also provide some leveraged trading opportunities for traders in a full price range.

Any idea how it can be constructed? Documentation states that is is ( asset, fee, asset, fee, asset ) list which swaps from assed before fee to asset after fee until last asset is reached. Which is fine, but where can I find a list of pools with their fees that can be used as hops? They surely are not to be guessed out of thin air?

See code below as an example - commented out revert statement one line above uniswapRouter.exactInput() was used to verify that my contract holds enough token to swap, and approval is given one line above that, but I can not reach revert one line below swap operation, exactInput reverts. I have it working for another swap pair, for two very common assets, so I was able to guess a path for them but I cannot for less popular assets. What am I missing here?

On a related note, can we get API (or download) access to the available charts? For example, the charts available on the website such as this one: [https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2](https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2).

First, let’s take a look at the working process of inflation tokens to compensate for the impermanent loss. Here we take ETH-BNT as an example. When you provide x0 ETH for single-sided liquidity, the system will mint an equivalent amount of BNT and then deposit both tokens into the ETH-BNT pool together. When the price of ETH rises, the amount of ETH in the pool will decrease. If removing liquidity, you will receive the remaining ETH in the pool and receive the impermanent loss compensation by BNT, the value of those remaining ETH plus the compensated BNT is equal to x0 ETH when you initially provide liquidity. In this case, there are two sources of BNT for compensation, one is the trading fee and the other is the additional minting of BNT. When the price of ETH falls, the amount of ETH in the pool will increase. If you withdraw the liquidity, you will receive x0 ETH when you provide liquidity. Although BNT does not need to compensate your impermanent loss at this time, the BNT in the pool becomes less than initially minted. In other words it is equivalent to mint additional BNT in disguised form when you deposit. As a result , BNT will be additionally issued no matter the price up or down. The more volatile the more BNT issued, the more BNT will be issued. Let’s take an extreme example next. If you are an ETH whale, raise ETH first 10x, then remove the liquidity, and would get much BNTs compensation for impermanent loss. Subsequently you add huge ETHs again, and sell the much BNTs to move the ETH price back to first time providing liquidity. The system issued BNT twice during the rise and fall, but the price of ETH remained unchanged. If the process is profitable, it will be attracting more people to come in to operate, resulting in a massive increase in BNT similar to luna, and finally triggering the collapse of BNT.

However, for one category of cryptos there is relatively good quality of data available to assess its investment quality. These are crypto exchange tokens, centralized and decentralized. There is publicly available data that publishes their daily dollar trading volumes and the daily number of trades. We can all agree that crypto exchanges are a place where revenues are made (transaction fees, staking, providing liquidity, lending, etc). Most of these exchanges also have their own trading token, such as Binance's BNB token and Uniswap's UNI token. I think it's a reasonable assumption to make that if trading volumes and market shares increase for a particular exchange, then so will the demand and price support for its trading token as well.

From the centralized exchanges, I was examining Binance, Huobi, and Gate and noticed that over the last year Binance's and Gate's market share has grown considerably while Huobi's has decreased. This trend seems to be reflected in their respective token prices with BNB and GT down about 50% from their ATH while HT is down 80% from its ATH.

From the decentralized exchanges, I was examining UniSwap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, Curve, and Compound. Over the last year, Uniswap's and Curve's marketshare has grown, PancakeSwap's marketshare has decreased somewhat, and Compound and SushiSwap's market shares have considerably decreased. As an investor, I'd like to know why UniSwap and Curve has grown in popularity.

I don't use DEXs, so I'd like to ask which DEXs do you use? What has been your experiences with any DEX and are there any you recommend to use or avoid? Do you find it to be a good avenue to make additional, steady income? Thank you for sharing.","self","https://redd.it/uru3gc"

The automatic market maker (AMM) is one of the great innovations of dex. It solves the liquidity problem on the chain. Many people have made many explorations on liquidity market making from order book market making to automatic market making. What is the difference between AMM and order book? The author mainly summarizes the following differences:

**1. As long as the price returns, AMM are capital-guaranteed tradings**

Traditional market makers generally use poor information or technical analysis to sell high and buy low, which is essentially an arbitrage behavior. However, the final loss/gain of AMM must be zero deducting transaction fees, but traditional market makers by order book may also earn the difference value in price fluctuations. For example, if AMM sells Ethereum at 1000$, then it must buy Ethereum at 1000$, while the traditional market makers may sell Ethereum at 1000$. And buy at 900$, of which 1000$-900$=100$ is your profit, of course, you may also buy back Ethereum at 1050$, which will lead to the failure of market making and a loss of 50$. And there must be no losing trades or profitable trades except trading fees for the AMM if the price returns back. All trades are capital-guaranteed.

**2. AMM has no any spreads**

AMM can trade at any price, while orders for traditional order books can only be submitted at the minimum price tick size of the system. For example, the minimum tick size of Bitcoin on many exchanges is 0.5$. To meet this requirement, your transaction price cannot be 30000.1$ or 30000.6$. However automated market makers can trade at any price like 30000.0000002$.

**3. The price of AMM is automatically matched by the algorithm, and the price of the order book is determined by the orders**

As we all know, decentralized exchanges cannot place and cancel orders frequently due to the limited performance of the blockchain. The automatic market making model can not only solve the liquidity problem, but also greatly reduce the dependence on computing efficiency. The price discovery of traditional order books is determined by active pending orders. Recently dex has a tendency to move closer to the order book with the emergence of uniswap V3. It is a new type of automatic market maker between traditional automatic market makers and order books. As long as the price can return to the starting point, all transactions are guaranteed. Of course, you can also remove liquidity, which is similar to the order cancer for the traditional order book, wait for the price to move to a suitable position, and then re-place the order to earn the difference value of price fluctuations.

Today, the author will deduce the equivalence between the two from a mathematical point of view.

**1. 50/50 pools to xy=k**

Taking the pool ETH-USDT as an example, assuming that the value of tokenA(ETH) and tokenB(USDT) in the pool are always equal, and the reserve amount of tokenA is x and the reserve amount of tokenB is y, then the values ​​of the two are equal:

y=px — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -( 1)

The exchange price is p, then p=-dy/dx — — — — — — (2)

Substitute (2) into (1) to have:

dy/dx=-y/x

dy/y=-dx/x

after integrating both sides, we get:

lny=-lnx+C

lny+lnx=C

ln(xy)=C

xy=e\^C

That is, the general solution is

xy=k

**2、xy=k to 50/50 pools**

The reserve amount of ETH is x, and the reserve amount of USDT is y.

xy=k — — — — — — — — — — — — — — (3)

Then y=k/x — — — — — — — — — ----------(4)

After taking the derivative:

dy/dx = -k/x² — — — — — — — ---------------(5)

Substitute (3) into (5) to get

y=-xdy/dx=px

Therefore, the value of ETH and USDT are also equal. It should be noted here that dy/dx=-p is because the amount of one token increases for the pool, and the amount of another token must decrease, so the change of the token is equal to the negative of the price .

To sum up, 50/50 pool and xy=k are completely equivalent.

Assuming that the value of tokenA in the pool is 80% and the value of tokenB is 20% in total value of pool, the reserve amount of tokenA is x, and the reserve amount of tokenB is y, then the two token values satisfy:

y=-(20%/80%)\*px — — — — — — — — — — — — -— — — — — -(1)

Used it to buy Saitama a while back, and it took about 3 days to place the coins in my trust wallet.

This time I, on a lark, bought Terra. It's now been a week. I've checked, and double checked, that the transaction was completed - it was. Steps I took were exactly the same, but the coins still don't show up in Trust Wallet.

I've considered that it's just the heavy traffic, but we are also talking code, so it's not exactly slow.

# Don't pay any more Buy and Sell Taxes

No more exorbitant taxes up to 40% per token. Become a winner **over all other buyers** by selling well before they do. Profit is waiting for you, dominate all tokens easily !

# A manipulation that works for life

Once the Pancakeswap transaction router has received your signature after the manipulation. You will not pay any more taxes **for life** according to the **amount you have chosen** !

# Already used by Defi traders

Many Defi traders use this method to be tax-exempt. That’s why some buyers sell their tokens long **before you do**. Now you have the trick in your hands. You will love decentralized finance !","self","https://redd.it/uv356h"

For the convenience of future calculation, we make a general derivation of the impermanent loss under different ratio of the two tokens for CPMM(Constant Product Market Maker). Firstly, we assume that the amount of eth(tokenA) is x, the amount of usdt(tokenB) is y, and the value ratio of eth in the pool is r, then:

Many times we are confused about these terms. If you work with EVM, you must use ""Gas"". Gas is working like a Gasoline.Forget everything and think of EVM like FedEX or UPS. EVM is a shipping company. You have a package for delivery and EVM calculates cost like these shipping companies. FedEx or UPS(EVM) measures the distance between the shipping place and destination of the cargo and multiplies it by the gasoline price. The farther the distance, the more expensive it will be to ship the cargo.Making a transfer at EVM is like sending a package with a shipping company. The only difference is the unit difference.Shipping company measure the distance with ""KM"" and EVM measure with ""Gas Limit"" Shipping company uses ""Gasoline"" and EVM uses ""Gas"" as fuel. Shipping company calculates gasoline price with ""USD"" and EVM calculates with ""Gwei""

The distance to send an Ethereum is 21000 gas. It is Fixed. Distance between Washington and New York is fixed.

If you type a low gas like 15000, your fuel is over and you would be stranded on the road, that means your transaction will be failed and you waste your gasoline.

If you type a high gas like 40000, your fuel would be abundant. You can say i never type a gas on MetaMask. Right,MetaMask calculates it for you. It knows how much gas is needed. This means,MetaMask measures the distance for you and says how much gasoline you need to put in.

You set up GWEI. Not gas limit, not gas. Gwei is the price of gasoline. 1 Gwei equal 0.000000001 ETH. You check it on Etherscan and see 100 Gwei. This is the price offered for 1 gas. Let's calculate the cost with this Gwei for sending Ethereum.

1. Gas Limit to send an Ethereum is 21000 GAS
2. Gwei is 100
3. 100 Gwei is 0.000000001 ETH
4. 21000 x 0.0000001 ETH = 0.0021 ETH This is the cost of sending Ethereum. The only thing that has changed in transfers is the Ether fee you pay per Gas, which is Gwei.

Attention, This is not the USD equivalent. Does the gas fee increase if the ether price rises? Of course, if the Gwei price stays fixed. However, Gwei is not fixed. If Ether price goes up, you will pay 1000 Wei, not 100 Gwei. 1 Gwei = 1,000,000,000 Wei

That is the same on all chains running on EVM. Send a MATIC in Polygon is 21000 GAS Send a BNB in BNBChain is 21000 Gas So why Ethereum is expensive and these are cheap?

Same distance, same shipping company car(DOBLO). So let's find the answer. Gwei, i mean the price offered for 1 gas is low on BNBChain and other EVM Chains. So why is it low? Because of scalability and security. Check Ethereum Trilemma.

Well, if the Gwei is the same, why swap on Uniswap is more expensive than sending Ethereum? It's about Gas Limit. So distances is very long. Sending Ethereum 21000 Gas Swap on Uniswap 130000 Gas Using TornadoCash 300000 Gas Long distances means requires too much gas(gasoline)

So, we are saying that Ethereum's scalability is impossible because of Gas Limit and Gas. Distances are long and the cars use gasoline a lot. Ethereum is like a Ferrari. Fast and expensive.For scalability, we need to shorten the distance between New York and Washington(Snark). It means we need to reduce the gas and gas limit.

Scalability means reducing gas and gas limit. You should buy a fast car and shorten the distances. High Throughput, it is to enlarge cargo vehicles. The distance is the same, you just take in more cargo. Thanks to TobbyKitty for this source. ertugrul\_eth","self","https://redd.it/uwl2yp"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

As a growing network that started with a relatively small user base, it has accumulated over $5 billion worth in total value locked (TVL). Before this hit, it was recorded as the 5th largest sum in the DeFi ecosystem.

It is also available on Polygon, which is an Ethereum sidechain. Therefore, Gnosis and Moonbeam will be the first Ethereum-independent networks to which this decentralized exchange will be brought.

Gnosis is an Ethereum-derived network that aims to develop decentralized finance ecosystems (DeFi) through predictive markets such as oracles. For its part, Moonbeam is a ""parachain"" that aims to achieve the integration of Polkadot and Ethereum in the same network.

One of the great benefits that this expansion can bring, is the increase of projects and pre-sales, as it will seek to make weight in this part of the market as DxSale does as for example GMR, or as it will do with Minosis Token and among many more upcoming launches with potential.

Since Uniswap works under the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) format, the holders of the platform's native token, UNI, were in charge of voting for the platform's expansion a few days ago.

The vote was almost unanimous for both networks with only 3,000 votes against (less than 0.1% of more than 40 million votes counted in each).

Uniswap holds, according to DeFiLlama, the fifth highest TVL (total value locked) of all DeFi's within Ethereum, making it one of the most important within the network.

These merits that Uniswap has achieved have caught the attention of Ethereum's own co-creator, Vitalik Buterin, who, on repeated occasions, has shown his support for this platform.

On one occasion, Buterin suggested that, given the importance Uniswap plays within the entire ecosystem, the platform should consider becoming an oracle. These serve as an intermediary between real-world information, such as cryptocurrency prices, and the information that dwells within the blockchain.

Such is the approach that, as the official Uniswap portal shows, the creator of Uniswap, Hayden Zadams, had a meeting with Buterin himself that helped him form what this platform is today.","self","https://redd.it/uxojd2"

Although it is based on a limited user base, it shows that there is much room for expansion in the future. After little over three years, the DEX's cumulative addresses reached roughly 3.9 million this month, according to statistics from Uniswap Labs, a significant contributor to the protocol's ecosystem's growth.

In addition to enabling crypto trades, Uniswap recently formed a Web 3 enterprises branch and hired a new policy director as it attempts to negotiate crypto legislation. Faith Tribe, Threedium, Metaloop, MetaTokyo, and other cryptocurrencies can be used as collateral for cash loans.

Uniswap presently supports layer-2 scaling solutions Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitron. Uniswap Labs also announced earlier this month that the DEX would be expanded to include two EVM-compatible chains, Gnosis Chain and Moonbeam Network, and a Polkadot-based para-chain.

The $1 trillion volume mark was already forecasted months ago. The exchange’s performance improved and the speculators saw an increase in participation, reducing the time it takes to attain the target.

In the previous post, we compared the difference of impermanent loss between 50/50 pools such as uniswap and 80/20 pools such as balancer. Impermanent loss is a concern of liquidity providers, but traders are more concerned about swap slippage. The swap slippage refers to the difference between the swap price and the spot price of pools. In a centralized exchange, the worse the order book depth, the larger the slippage. So for automatic market makers, what does the slippage depend on? Let’s compare the difference between 50/50 pools and 80/20 pool slippage now. Assuming that the number of ETH is x, the amount of USDT is y, and the proportion of value for ETH is r, then it satisfies:

y=k(x)\^(r/(r-1)) — — — — — — — — (1)

According to the proportional relationship between ETH and USDT:

yr=(1-r)px — — — — — — — — — — — (2)

The trader swap △y USDT to the liquidity pool for △x ETH, then after the swap, the liquidity pool satisfies:

y+△y=k(x-△x)\^(r/(r-1)) — — — — — — (3)

Simultaneous (1) (2) (3) get:

△x=x(1-(1+△y/y)\^ ((r-1)/r) —— — — -(4)

So swap price:

△y/△x=△y/ x(1-(1+△y/y)\^ ( (r-1)/r)=p((1-r)/r)(△y/y )/ (1-(1+△y/y)\^ ( (r-1)/r) — ------------------------(5)

That is,

It can be seen from the above formula that the swap price Pswap is positively related to △y/y,

When r=0.5, the swap price:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gu1ytr2s54291.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=99ce801f39ff0c698740df0df9d9ce8e175fc1ef

Here,Pswap0.5<Pswap0.2.

In fact, Pswap is a monotonically decreasing function of r, as shown in the figure below, that is, the larger r, the smaller the Pswap. For example, when you go to 80/20 pools to swap the 80% tokens for the 20% tokens in the liquidity pools, you will suffer larger slippage than that of 50/50 pools with the same △y/y. But when you go to 80/20 pools to swap the 20% tokens for the 80% tokens in the liquidity pools, you will suffer lower slippage than that of 50/50 pools with the same △y/y.

So how much should it pay for the impermanent loss protection? Whether new BNT will be issued to the market is a question that many people care about for this IL solution. Now we can mathematically deduce how much will BNT pay for impermanent loss protection? First, let’s review the impermanence loss calculation formula of the xyk model: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6z3n58ctd5291.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdbd0b125aeb47f4ead046749d2b593a4dc2e872

 

Here we take BNT-USDT as an example. Assuming that when the price is P0, the liquidity provider deposits y0 USDT to the bancor protocol to provide single sided liquidity, then Bancor will issue an additional x0 BNT for the liquidity provider to deposit into the liquidity pool of BNT-USDT, and when the price moves to Pn, the liquidity provider withdraws USDT equivalent to y0 and LP fees, then the change in the net value of bancor calculated in BNT is: \[(xn-x0) + (yn-y0)/pn\] /x0;

The net change in USDT is: \[(xn-x0)\*pn + (yn-y0)\]/y0.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y63n32oud5291.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a6de40d2846b576a6195560834233aeb84fbf9a

 

Then the loss rate of impermanent loss protection calculated in USDT is 𝐼𝐿𝑃(𝑈𝑆𝐷𝑇 %)=\[(xn-x0)\*pn + (yn-y0)\]/y0/y0–1

According to

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v4nzwprvd5291.png?width=192&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d60507bf1ecde732b33108fbddb6bf36c95dbbd

 We get:

The loss rate of impermanent loss protection calculated in BNT is 𝐼𝐿𝑃(BNT %)=\[(xn-x0) + (yn-y0)/pn\]/x0/x0–1

Based the same as above we get:

&#x200B;

As can be seen from the above calculation, we can know that no matter whether the price of BNT-USDT rises or falls, BNT needs to bear impermanent loss. We can further observe the size of this loss with specific percentage.

 That is to say, when the fluctuation of BNT/USDT exceeds 75%, the amount of BNT additional issuance into the market will double, and for trading pairs with less volatility, the additional issuance of BNT is less obvious. As long as the fluctuation does not exceed 10%, the withdrawal fee of 0.25% can basically cover this part of the loss, but if the price of BNT itself is unstable, its decline will lead to a vicious circle, because the additional issuance of BNT caused by the decline will be infinite, and the upper limit of the additional issuance caused by the increase of BNT is 100%. However, each removal of liquidity will result in an additional issuance of BNT, which can be accumulated in a continuous cycle. It will always increase as same as thermodynamic entropy. For example, if liquidity is removed when BNT/USDT falls by 20%, additional issuance will occur. 1.4%, then added the liquidity again, the liquidity was removed again when and the price rose by 20%, and another additional 1.4% was issued. Although the price of BNT/USDT did not change for the above circle, BNT was issued an additional 2.8%. The cycle repeats, even if the price fluctuates little, the cumulative additional issuance of BNT will also be relatively large, and especially for those tokens with severe fluctuations, the additional BNT will be much more.

The solution of impermanent loss will be one of the important directions of defi 2.0. Recently, the author saw a view that multi-token in one pool can reduce the risk of impermanent loss. Is it true? I have a negative attitude towards this. On the contrary, I think that multi-tokens in one pool not only increase the risk of impermanent losses but also increase the risk of price exposure. For example, 16 tokens constitute one pool such as balancer, and 2 tokens pairs form 8 liquidity pools such as uniswap. Assuming that the 16 tokens include a shit coin such as luna or UST. As for the first protocal, 15 tokens in the one liquidity pool will be sold by the AMM protocol. In the end, all liquidity providers’ assets will be reset to zero. But as for the second protocol, 16 tokens scattered in 8 different liquidity pools, only one liquidity pool including luna will suffer losses, while the other 7 pools will not be affected. Based on the above point of view, the multi-token liquidity pool model greatly aggravates the market risk, while the dual-token pool separates the market risk very well. Of course, the one with the lowest risk is the single-sided staking model, which is also one of the directions of our efforts in the future.

In the previous articles, we analyzed the impermanent loss of uniswap V2 and the calculation formula of BNT impermanent loss protection in detail. If you make a comparison between these two cases, you will find that BNT impermanent loss protection will pay much more than impermanent loss itself.

We know that the impermanent loss calculation formula of xyk is:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0hfgm7s28d291.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=fccd8c0b27c473d1f700e0e18bf541b62541aba5

 

The loss rate of BNT’s impermanent loss protection is:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/093ttu948d291.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=608c08baab883ef0557668e85810f27401a141e0

 

Wherein P0 is the price of adding liquidity, and Pn is the price of removing liquidity.

As a result ILP(BNT%) <= IL(xyk), indicating that the BNT impermanent loss protection will pay much more than the impermanent loss itself. Based on the above formula, we further know that the range of IL(xyk) is (-100%, 0) and the range of ILP(BNT%) is (-∞,0). And also we can intuitively compare the specific numbers:

When the price drops 10%, IL(xyk)=-0.14%, ILP(BNT%)=-0.29%

When the price drops 20%, IL(xyk)=-0.62%, ILP(BNT%)=-1.39%

When the price drops by 50%, IL(xyk)=-5.72%, ILP(BNT%)=-17.1%

When the price drops 75%, IL(xyk)=-20%, ILP(BNT%)=-100%

When the price drops by 90%, IL(xyk)=-42.5%, ILP(BNT%)=-467%

It can be seen from the above that the risk of impermanent loss protection provided by BNT is far greater than the impermanent loss protection itself. This is mainly because impermanent loss protection is completely exposed to the price risk of single token. Even worse, whereas any liquidity removal will accrue the loss, but impermanent loss itself does not be accrued loss due to liquidity removal.

V2’s impermanent loss protection requires the single assets to be staked for 100 days to obtain 100% impermanent loss protection, while V3 provides the impermanent loss protection time to 7 days, meanwhile the single-sided farms need to pay 0.25% withdrawal fee, which may limit malicious arbitrage to a certain extent. But how much impermanent loss protection can the 0.25% withdrawal fee cover? Still based on the formula we derived earlier: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvdtujnqvi391.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=df4a6718f2e8d76455f5e9c04fc2f49094ebc429

 It can be obtained that Pn/P0=1.1080 or 0.9070, that is, the price fluctuation range is between -9.3% and 10.8%, and the 0.25% withdrawal fee can completely cover the loss caused by impermanent loss protection. It is normal to fluctuate 10% within a week due to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, in most cases, the 0.25% withdrawal fee cannot completely cover the loss of impermanent loss protection, but only reduces the loss to a certain extent. Of course, for liquidity providers, more than 0.25% profit within a week means that the annualization exceeds 13% to achieve capital preservation, which also inhibits the short-term withdrawal demand of liquidity providers to a certain extent. Therefore, if the single-side pair is highly volatile, the impermanent loss of BNT is more likely to cause losses, and the more liquidity providers have short-term adding and removing liquidity, leading to the higher the cost of BNT impermanent loss.

However, recently I have seen some projects claiming that they use multi-token index funds to eliminate impermanent loss. But are they telling the truth? To answer this question, we need to understand the definition of impermanent loss, which is a difference in value between the value of participating in the automatic market making of the liquidity pool and not participating. Many automatic market makers such as uniswap use a constant product xy =k model to achieve automatic market making. In the process of automatic market making, the AMM pools always sell your high-value assets and then you hold more low-value assets, resulting in a difference in value from not participating in market making, which is so called impermanent loss. However, an index fund refers to building an investment portfolio by holding a variety of tokens with capitalization-weighted. In fact, It does not participate in market making for index funds which are only the role of a holder with no earning of trading fees. The profit and loss of an index fund depends on the weight distribution of the underlying assets. It has nothing to do with impermanent losses in automatic market making. So I think the project claiming to eliminate impermanent losses through multi-token index funds is just a gimmick of the project side, using an irrelevant concept as a publicity tool to attract investors.

Many projects have proposed different solutions for this. Recently, I saw a project solve the problem of impermanent loss by coupling two AMMs of uniswap and balancer. The idea of ​​reducing impermanent loss by dynamically adjusting the weight of tokens seems to have been firstly proposed by bancor before they released the V2 version. However, they did not choose this technical route in the end and launched a impermanent loss protection by inflation tokens compensation. The reason is very simple. Although dynamic weight adjustment can reduce impermanent loss, However, it increases trading slippage and hinders market activity. It also can be seen from the data in their white paper. Compared with uniswap, sync-AMM with dynamic weights increases the maximum slippage from 1.5% to tripled 4.5% under the same condition. This increase in trading costs is fatal to traders. Although their backtest data shows that LP returns have also increased compared to uniswap or balancer, the test data does not consider traders’ trading costs. The problem is that most traders will not choose it unless it is profitable to arbitrage. However, the transaction will become very inactive if just only by the promotion of arbitrage, and the income of LP fees will also be greatly reduced. Therefore, through dynamic weights to reduce impermanent loss is not an efficient solution.

Although dynamic adjustment of token weights can help reduce impermanent losses, it increases trading slippage and finally reduces fee income. The overall income maybe not be higher than that of the fixed weight. But in the case of a fixed token weight, can the dynamic adjustment of the trading fee help reduce impermanent loss? In fact, according to the calculation formula of impermanence loss: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d4rbd7uw9r391.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed5766e496a95da58086fb88909ac5a54a58d92b

 

Impermanent loss is only related to initial price P0 and ending price Pn and has nothing to do with the trading fees. That is to say, dynamic adjustment of the trading fees cannot reduce impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is just only affected by price fluctuations. In other words, is it possible to make up for impermanent loss by increasing the trading fees?

So let’s compare the returns of the two token pools (WETH-USDC 0.05%) and (WETH-USDC 0.3%) on uniswap: the traders should pay 0.05% per transactions for the first pool and pay 0.3% per transactions for the second pool.

&#x200B;

We found that the daily rate of return of (WETH-USDC 0.05%) is 0.036%, while the daily rate of return of (WETH-USDC 0.3%) is 0.032%. The rate of return increasing with decreasing of the trading fees, indicating that increasing the trading fee can not compensate for impermanent loss more. The trading fee difference in percentage between the above two liquidity pools is 6 times, and the final yield is only 0.004% different in percentage. Therefore, it is difficult to make up for impermanent losses by dynamically adjusting the fee.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

&#x200B;

Do not pay any more Taxes or Fees when you buy tokens on Pancakeswap ! The Tutorial only lasts a few seconds and it will save you a lot of money.

&#x200B;

Many projects take up to more than 20% of your investment on BUY and SELL functions because of the taxes included in the token-specific contracts.

&#x200B;

It depends on certain projects but generally these funds are directly taken during the transaction carried out during your purchase but also during the resale of your tokens.

&#x200B;

Imagine buying a token with 20% fees for $1000. Just for the purchase you lose $200! Imagine that it pumps and therefore multiplies its value by 10: $800 x 10 = $1600 lost a second time. Whereas if you use the trick below you can recover $8000 all round.

It is relatively complicated to calculate the the swap slippage of uniswap V3 due to its liquidity is a piecewise function of price. Of course, we can also obtain it through the front end of the uniswap web page:

https://preview.redd.it/dg229twfyw491.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=1490eaabc7230b5d385e6eb0888bb7486cd65ee5

 But how do you get the swap slippage by calculating it yourself? Let’s analyze it in detail below. Taking ETH-USDT as an example, we know that the price on uniswap V3 is represented by tick, that is, 𝑝(𝑖) = 1.0001\^𝑖, 𝑖 is the tick order, firstly we set all liquidity of the ETH-USDT pool as segments. Suppose it is divided into n segments, then the liquidity in each tick space included in the n segment is the same. We mark it as L1, L2…Ln, and the price range of each segment is \[Pan, Pbn\], the current price is P0, we need to calculate how much you can swap u0 usdt for ETH. As we all know, the amount of USDT and Ep in the current segment as 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q8kx7c7hyw491.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b785d3c5e9d5d4a6562d320ea8fa71a65f2f22

 

Obviously at the endpoints of the current segment Pan and Pbn will have Epn ETH and Upn USDT

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pt0sqrfiyw491.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=c63532aa67860cefbd0283d7dc140864954644cd

 

When u0+up<=up, the swap would be completed in the current segment, and at this time:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xw15nbkjyw491.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=145a532cc21d36c0b7dcc7b88399b143ee3fa931

 

Wherein px is the final price of pool after swap,

According to (1) to (6), it can be calculated as followed:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m72gtjvkyw491.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=d27098870b3a72dbd3f3c244e65477eb03389226

 

Then the swap price Pswap

https://preview.redd.it/e08lrv0myw491.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=069a51299c44fefbd4b3191ff98afd51662ca982

 

Then we can get the slipgage (%)

When u0+up>up, that is, when tick-cross occurs, it is only necessary to repeat the calculation for the remaining part after the swap in the current segment in the next segment, and the final slippage can be calculated.

At the beginning, curve mainly provided stable coin exchange, such as USDT, USDC, DAI, etc. Its stable coin exchange even has smaller slippage than centralized exchanges. And any two ERC-20 tokens can be traded on Uniswap, and uniswap adopts a constant product market-making model. The exchange slippage of stablecoins has no advantage over curve. For a long time, there is no direct competition for curve and uniswap with different users. However, after the launch of uniswap V3, the exchange slippage of stablecoins was greatly reduced, and then curve also launched the V2 version providing the exchange of fluctuating assets. So far, curve and uniswap create fierce competition between fluctuating assets and stablecoin exchange. But many people have a question: which protocol has lower slippage for curve and uniswap under the same conditions?

To answer the above question, we compare the slippage difference between the two by the following comparable conditions:

The slippage for exchanging 2000ETH for USDT on uniswap V3 is 0.6%, and 55% of the exchange volume is exchanged through the route of the two pools of WETH/USDC — USDC/USDT. The total TVL of the two pools is 251m+129m=380m, while The TVL on curve is 403m, so under the same conditions, we need to exchange 2000\*55%\*403/380=1166ETH with exchange slippage of 1.47% on curve, which is more than twice the slippage on uniswap. So the slippage of the curve is larger than that of the unsiwap V3 under comparable conditions.

In the previous article, we compared the slippage difference between curve and uniswap V3 through data. We can find that under comparable conditions, the slippage of uniswap V3 is smaller than that of curve, but some people want to know why. So today we will start from the technical principles of curve and uniswap to analyze why the slippage of the curve is larger than that of uniswap V3. As we all know, curve adopts the mixed curve equation of constant product and constant sum. As for the constant sum market making curve, the exchange price has no slippage with limited liquidity, but as for the constant product market making curve, the exchange price exists slippage with unlimited liquidity. To achieve lower slippage of exchange for AMM, curve combines the above two curves and proposes a hybrid market making curve:

A(P0x+y)+xy=k

Wherein P0 is the balanced price

y=(k-P0Ax)/(X+A)

Derivation of the above formula can get the price

Therefore, the larger A , the closer the exchange price to P0, that is, the smaller the slippage,

According to the market making curve of uniswap V3,

It can be seen from the above that the exchange price of curve is strongly related to A, while the exchange price of uniswap V3 is strongly related to m, and we know that the amplification factor A in curve is determined internally by the protocol and cannot be changed by external users, while the amplification factor m of uniswap V3 is completely determined by the price range set by the external liquidity provider. In other words, the amplification factor m can theoretically be infinitely. However the amplification factor A of curve cannot be infinitely in order to ensure infinite liquidity. So the slippage of the curve must be larger than that of uniswap V3.

Hey guys, I'm the guy running crypto for the homeless. We recently just had our 3 year anniversary (4/28/19 start date) a couple months ago - this post is a little bit late.

For those of you who don't know, crypto for the homeless (CFTHL) is a non-profit organization I created with the intention of doing something unique with crypto while at the same time helping the needy.

I started it completely out of pocket at the start and was able to get the organization of its feet immediately due to the massive support shown from social media (mainly reddit).

I never set out to ""solve"" homelessness, as I think that is a systemic problem that even governments can not fix - but rather to re-introduce a human aspect of charity that I felt was sorely missing from most other projects (at least in my opinion).

We differentiated ourselves by utilizing all of the funds we received thus far on food/goods for the homeless, and also delivering food straight to the homeless/needy. In addition to this, we have photo documentation of all food hand outs as well as receipts dating back to the very first time we handed out food (3+ full years of photos at this point) which I believe no other charity has come close to doing.

While we had very humble beginnings, we are proud to have 501c3 status for 2+ years now, and also recently launched our brand new website [http://cryptoforthehomeless.com](http://cryptoforthehomeless.com/) (check it out).

We also have had a massive amount of volunteer support (people buy and hand out food for us and get reimbursed in crypto). Our partners in New Zealand have been doing the most amazing work consistently for us and I could not be prouder. [https://imgur.com/a/cBoAUNg](https://imgur.com/a/cBoAUNg) \- here is an album of some of their recent work.

In terms of donations, we have received enough (roughly $75,000 thus far) to last us probably a decade or more of work at our current rate (if we ration the spending to maintain our current rate), which I view as a massive success and also a guarantee of our longevity.

I've learned a ton from running this project thus far - and I've used a lot of it to try and improve the project if possible.

1. It is impossible to satisfy 100% of people with ANY project - for this one in particular, there are those who oppose helping homeless people in general and thus they will inherently hate this project no matter what I do.
2. It is impossible to make this project 100% ""trustless"" despite what most people who have that criticism say. It is ultimately a project based on human work, and the best that I/we can do is provide a massive amount of proof of work (which we have) that should be used as a basis of our legitimacy. At this point, having 3+ years of photos as well as documenting over $20,000 donations in monero should be more than enough proof of our legitimacy (in addition to reimbursing 100% of our volunteers who participated properly).
3. A lot of people want to steer the project in many different directions - ultimately the project's design is a very personal thing when it comes down to it. I personally created it with a very specific vision in mind - and that may not align with what you(or other people) feel the best vision is. That is perfectly fine - and you/they are free to create a project to carry out that vision in the same way I have carried out mine. Projects like this cost time/money and the very fact that enough supporters on the internet have funded this project to last us 10+ years now at least shows that we have a reason to exist. I am beyond grateful for this support and intend to respect the intentions of our donors for the extreme long term.

Which brings us to future plans -

We currently have a couple people including myself dedicating quite a lot of time each day working on the websites/social media/communicating with volunteer prospects/etc. There are actually a lot of things that occur behind the scenes that are very time consuming and we could use 1 or 2 more people working with us on the team on various things (social media/engagement/etc). This is one of our top priorities right now - so if this is something you can see yourself doing - please reach out to me, even if the amount of time you can commit is small!

Also, as I have stated earlier - we are proud of the fact that all of the funds thus donated to us have been entirely dedicated to the buying and reimbursing of food/goods for the homeless (and I intend to keep it that way). One repeated suggestion that I have had was to pay our employees for their time, even minimal. Because of our pledge to not use the funds for that purpose at the start, we had to come up with a different solution which is as follows:

[https://www.flowcode.com/page/lmcfthl](https://www.flowcode.com/page/lmcfthl) \- these are wallets we set up for the sole purpose of optional support to provide our employees (again this is just to have the option there - we absolutely do not require anything to continue to operate, but if you want to support the employees that have been working completely free since the start this is the way to do it).

That about sums it up for now - I hope we met/exceeded the expectations of those of you who have followed us from the beginning - if not, we will try even harder going forward. Feel free to post any and all criticism/suggestions/support/anything and we will take it all in!","self","https://redd.it/vcjpo5"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock","self","https://redd.it/vcx816"

Generally, the Uniswap cryptocurrency exchange platform is the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Ethereum blockchain. Its enablement of automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts is unrivaled. 

Although it had previously moved past $1 trillion in trade volume, other cryptocurrency platforms such as Kraken, Exeno, and probably crypto,com, and others are actively moving forward with their advancements towards developing their positions in the web3 space, with Exeno creating more access to purchase a variety of products using safe crypto payments on its platform and Kraken increasingly taking on eco-friendly projects amidst the current crypto winter as well as improving its profitability through trades. 

Overall numerous crypto platforms are continually developing their blockchains and ecosystems with new technologies and partnerships to further advance the web3 space and Uniswap’s newest Addition of Cunningham into its decentralized exchange helps implement her experiences with the trading floor, trading traditional stocks, Nasdaq and NYSE. 

According to Cointelegraph, Uniswap is considered a decentralized exchange utilizing liquidity pools and Cunningham’s existing experience in numerous trading aspects is relative to the decentralized exchange's mission towards evolving its seat in the Web3 space.

In the last article, we theoretically deduced why the slippage of uniswap V3 is smaller than that of curve, but another question that what is the actual liquidity distribution of the two protocal? When adding liquidity to uniswap, we can see the following liquidity distribution diagram.

&#x200B;

What would the liquidity distribution of the curve V2 look like? We know that the liquidity of curve V2 is mainly concentrated near the price equilibrium point in order to reduce the slippage , but meanwhile to ensure unlimited liquidity, the liquidity distribution of curve V2 have to show a sharp normal distribution graph as shown in the figure below. However, the liquidity distribution of uniswap V3 is relatively flat ranging from -50% to 150% of the current price, as a result uniswap V3 can provide low slippage in a large price range, while curve V 2 only shows low slippage in a very narrow range of±5% of the current price, once beyond the peak range, the slippage increases dramatically.

&#x200B;

More importantly, the liquidity distribution of curve V2 depends on the internal oracle, so it changes passively, while the liquidity distribution of uniswap V3 changes actively because any external price changes will be fed back to uniswap V3 in real time.

We know that the impermanent loss of uniswap V3 can be calculated mathematically, and some people want to know how to calculate the impermanent loss of curve V2, and even ask if curve V2 will have impermanent loss? As long as there are impermanent loss in multi-token market making, even in traditional order book market making, there also exits similar impermanent loss. Can the impermanent losses of curve, be also calculated mathematically? Let’s take a look at the changes in the proportion of WETH and the swap price at two different times in the curve protocol. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2beh55zjgl691.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a3a7b69842a4d5d62f8f0617be03672ab0c8fa9

 

We found that the proportion of WETH is different even with an almost same swap price for the two times. Surprisingly, the asset ratio of liquidity providers does not necessarily return to the original point when the price returns to the original price. Therefore, there is no unique relationship between the ratio of curve’s asset and the swap price, and it is related to the path of price change. However, the value ratio of the tokens in the liquidity pool is fixed as long as the starting point and ending point of the price are the same for uniswap. When the price returns to the original point, the asset ratio must also return to the original point for uniswap. We know that the swap price of curve V2 is related to the price of the internal oracle. We can conclude that the price of the internal oracle is related to the price path, in other words, the price path is not necessarily the same even if the price is the same due to the uncertainty of the market trend. Therefore, the impermanent loss of curve V2 cannot be quantitatively calculated mathematically. The liquidity providers of curve V2 may suffer larger or smaller impermanent loss than uniswap under different market trends.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock","self","https://redd.it/vi3ggz"

 Its plan to ""unlock universal ownership and exchange"" on its platform includes the acquisition of the NFT marketplace aggregator. Uniswap will initially incorporate NFTs into its web app, enabling users to buy and sell such assets across all major marketplaces as well as in its developer APIs and widgets, according to the company's official blog post.

It is interesting to see Uniswap expand it's scope in the blockchain ecosystem, as platforms Binance, Kraken, Concordium and Cardano are continually developing their platforms to further enhance their presence in the ecosystem while also improving and expanding services available to users. With both Binance and Kraken already having already established their market place and Cordordium implementing  ID disclosure mechanism – with an ID-layer at the protocol level – allows regulators to revoke privacy to identify suspected bad actors and illegal transactions while also using self-sovereign ID and zero-knowledge proof to protect privacy. 

For those who are unaware, Genie not only makes it possible to purchase and sell items on other marketplaces in a single transaction, but it also displays listings from all the main rival marketplaces. Less than two months ago, NFT juggernaut OpenSea acquired rival Genie company Gem.

In August, Uniswap also intends to airdrop USDC to Genie beta testers. In essence, the stablecoin will be made available for up to 12 months to every user who had utilized the platform at least once or possessed a Genie Genesis NFT before April 15. Users of Genie will continue to get unhindered access to the website until the new Uniswap NFT experience is accessible, according to the statement. This news is from Crypto Potato.

Added to these developments to improve the decentralized exchange's ecosystem as well as the crypto and NFT sector, Uniswap's impressiveness has allowed newer NFT marketplace and crypto platforms to pick up the pace, Zora NFT marketplace and Zetric Blockchain have both been doing considerably well in further developing the NFT space, with Zetrix blockchain enabling issuance and sales of NFTs by creators on its NFT marketplace.

According to cointelegraph, Given Uniswaps considerable Fee rise, the popular DEX hasn't been the only blockchain to see a spike in fees, Aave, synthetix, and other platforms have seen a spike with $981,883 and $600,214 in average fees paid respectively.

As a result, some defi protocols have to remove liquidity from bancor’s single-sided liquidity mining. But why did bancor choose to suspend impermanent loss protection at this time? In fact, last month, the author analyzed in detail the specific principle of impermanent loss protection of bancor and its impact on the additional issuance of BNT. The cost of impermanent loss protection of the bancor protocol is highly correlated with token price fluctuations. For details, please refer to the previous analysis article [https://x3finance.medium.com/how-much-will-bnt-pay-for-impermanent-loss-protection-24da9cae38dd](https://x3finance.medium.com/how-much-will-bnt-pay-for-impermanent-loss-protection-24da9cae38dd)

Taking BNT-USD as an example, from April 3 to June 18, the cost of impermanent loss protection calculated in BNT is:

 That is to say, in just over two months, for the BNT-USD liquidity pool, bancor needs to issue an additional 2.48 times to compensate for the impermanent losses of single-sided liquidity providers. It is conceivable how much BNT holders have to bear selling pressure. Based on the above data analysis, it is not difficult to understand why the decline of BNT during the same period is significantly greater than that of other similar tokens, such as sushi and uni. Therefore, it is difficult to cope with the violent market volatility by inflation tokens to compensate the impermanent loss.

However, bancor’s impermanent loss protection has suffered a huge deficit due to the recent malicious market trend. The author has published a number of articles to study the impermanent loss protection of BNT. We have all come to a definite conclusion that it is unsustainable to compensate impermanent losses by means of inflation tokens, but I did not expect the collapse to come so quickly. In fact, the impermanent loss protection of BNT makes the holders of BNT bear obvious unequal risks. When the price returns to the starting point, the impermanent loss of the liquidity provider is zero, however the loss of ILP will continue to expand even if the price returns to the starting point, and will not be temporary like impermanent loss. As can be see from the below table, ILP loss is -200% when the price back to time T0, while impermant loss is 0%.

The specific calculation can refer to [https://x3finance.medium.com/how-much-will-bnt-pay-for-impermanent-loss-protection-24da9cae38dd](https://x3finance.medium.com/how-much-will-bnt-pay-for-impermanent-loss-protection-24da9cae38dd)

In other words, BNT holders bear the permanent loss accumulated all the time, not impermanent loss. Meanwhile, the permanent loss is highly correlated with price fluctuations, which is much greater than impermanent loss. Therefore, the failure of BNT’s impermanent loss protection scheme is inevitable.

Which strategy is more suitable for a long term investment? Do you prefer to just hodl? Or do a 50/50 LP? What about impermanent loss? How about generating some fees with a concentrated liquidity LP? How about a full range LP? Let us know in the poll and comments.

Edit 1: I am honestly amazed by how many people prefer to hodl on a uniswap sub! This is truly eye-opening.

Edit 2: Seems like IL is a bitch.

Edit 3 : Is liquidity providing just a retarded money exchange solution compared to an order book? Go figure..

Edit 4: If you thought Bancor was the answer with their single sided liquidity, you were wrong. They were just printing inflationary BNT to compensate for IL. The bear market ruined their strategy and they withdrew IL protection.

### Uni

That's the most popular decentralized exchange that keeps up with some famous centralized exchanges regarding trading volumes. It supports the most popular blockchains and allows swapping using liquidity pools. The future success of the exchange will depend on the capital inflow into DeFi and the development of the exchange itself. Today, the exchange purchased an NFT marketplace Genie, and it's widening the NFT functionality.

### GLMR

The blockchain was built as a para chain within the Polkadot platform. The platform creates new opportunities for the DeFi field. Moonbeam works with Ethereum tools and Ethereum network smart contracts and also collaborates with many DeFi projects in different blockchains. Examples are Curve, Beefy Finance, IDEX, SushiSwap, and Ocean Protocol. 

### LINK

It’s a decentralized network, allowing blockchains to safely engage with external databases. Chainlink already collaborates with Google. The internet giant applies Chainlink protocol for connecting users to cloud servers. The Chainlink protocol is a solution for an inflation index created by a DeFi financial company Truflation as an alternative for a consumer price index.

### ATOM

The main blockchain’s aim is to unite various blockchains and eliminate some technological boundaries. The Cosmos ecosystem has a great potential for growth as popular blockchains have already applied the technology created by the Cosmos team. The Cosmos network launched over 250 DeFi projects with a total capitalization of over $70 billion. Cosmos is using Binance Chain and OKExChain. 

### ETH

Moving the Ethereum blockchain to POS protocol should be completed in 2022. Some essential steps in renovation have already happened, and only the merging of the main network with Beacon Chain is left. That would be a transfer to POS. Ethereum is still a leader in the number of launched apps despite a massive number of competitors.

the question is, how is the USD value is determined for those coins/tokens?

I also thinking about this theory, for example I created some token called $TKN on BSC and then add BNB as a pair, so that now my token is swappable/tradable against BNB right?, and the USD value of my token can be determined by the fraction of the BNB value against my token, so, for example BNB USD price is $100, so if the AMM algorithm decide 1 BNB = 100 TKN, This means that each TKN will worth $1??

As we all know normal impermanent loss is just only 20% even with 80% price down, which is why the author said that the impermanence loss protection of bancor exceeds the impermanence loss itself. If you are interested, you can refer to the previous analysis article.

But some people want to know which is bigger for the loss of impermanent loss protection and market price fluctuations? We know that the volatility loss of the market is ML(%)=P0/Pn-1, that is, we need to compare the sizes of the following two formulas:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qcwb1u95x3991.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=760e7c9d0bffda65903f03ea6ff87a7ef1423739

wherein P0 is the initial price and Pn is the current price.

As can be seen from the figure below, when Pn/P0<0.3, the loss of impermanent loss protection will exceed the loss of price fluctuations. And the loss of impermanent loss protection is as high as 250% which is far exceeding the decreasing of BNT price just only 85% from April 3 to July 2. Therefore, the loss of BNT impermanent loss protection is not only higher than impermanent loss itself, but also would even exceed the decline in market prices. Under extreme conditions, the hyperinflation of BNT will increase exponentially, and you may lose all your capital.

We can analyze it carefully from the BNT issuance formula of impermanent loss protection:

Wherein P0 is the initial price and Pn is the current price;

When in the rising market, Pn>P0, then the range of ILP (inflation rate %) is (0,100%)

When in a falling market, Pn<P0, then the range of ILP(inflation rate %) is (0,+∞)

Here, we count the data from 2020/3/14–2021/5/9 in a bull market to estimate the theoretical inflation rate of BNT impermanent loss protection.

It can be seen from the table that during this statistical period, the theoretical increase of BNT is as high as 1914.69%. Such a high issuance rate has obviously reached the level of hyperinflation. Of course, this is only the theoretical expected value after considering all fluctuations in the market. In the bull market, since some people may always hold, the inflation rate will be smaller than that of theoretically. But even so, it is unsustainable for any one project with so high inflation rate.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock","self","https://redd.it/vsob3f"

Recently the pioneers of AMM and impermanent loss protection have been in huge trouble. Their impermanent loss protection has led to a huge deficit, over $40 million at its peak, and still has a deficit of $34,242,036 today. In the process, some people want to ask what was the best strategy for whales or retail investors providing single-sided liquidity on Bancor? Here are a few options, so you can decide which is best:

1. Just holding until removing liquidity forever;
2. Removing and re-adding when there is a large fluctuation;
3. Removing and re-adding when there is a large fluctuation, and shorting BNT at the same time.

I think many people actually choose 1, and smart investors may choose 2. But the best option is actually 3 for whales. For example, the crisis of BNT is due to the selling and shorting BNT by whales while removing single-sided liquidity. The whales were rewarded by a large number of BNT causing the price to plummet while sold; At the same time shorting also makes an additional profit for them. So this is the best strategy for whales to provide liquidity on bancor. As we all know, the inflation of BNT is calculated as followed:

Indicating that you can get BNT rewards for any price fluctuations.

So strategy 2 should be better selected for ordinary investors. It can be obtained double BNT rewards in the fluctuation, which maximizes the benefits.

I read many pages and docs about the math behind uniswap v3 , yet I didn't find a way to understand which math operations are actually computed during a token swap.

If an user try to swap 3 ETH for DAI:  what's the ordered and complete list of the math operation , computed by smart contracts  , in order to calculate the amount of DAI the user will receive  ? 

you can find many articles about the math behind uniswap V3, yet I was no able to find a clear explanation.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

If someone is also interested in it it is FREE to use..at least for now and looks sick. Still need to get my way around that since I am not and expert user but for some of you guys here it will be useful tool.

Apparently it will also have NFT PLN calculation that I would like to use and see how they actually do the calculations since I do a lot of NFT trading.

The only bad side of it is that they cover a few protocols but more are expected to be added in the upcoming weeks based on the roadmap but it covers UniSwap.

Also, no need to connect your wallet, you can just paste the wallet address and it will extract the date from the transactions as I don't really like to connect my main wallets to a lot of platforms.

## A 45% UNI price crash ahead?

UNI's price has been trending upward since mid June inside what appears to be a ""rising wedge,"" which traditional analysts view as a bearish reversal pattern due to its history of luring bulls into buying fake-out bounces.

Therefore, rising wedges resolve after the price breaks below the lower trendline. Traders typically calculate a rising wedge's downside target by subtracting the distance between its upper and lower trendline from the breakdown point.

That puts UNI's downside target at $3.8 by September 2022, down 45% from July 15's price if the breakdown begins near $6.52. However, the target would shift upward to $4.65 if the breakdown originates at the apex, i.e., where the wedge's trendlines converge, resulting in a drop of 32.25% from July 15's price

Interestingly, a rising wedge also formed between February and April. The pattern snapped a 65% upside move, with a broader 70% price slump that took UNI's value to $3.56 per unit from around $12.50.

## UNI price bullish catalysts

Simultaneously, Uniswap has also been painting an inverse head and shoulders (IH&S) pattern with an upside target sitting around $9.50, up 40% from current price levels.

Robinhood's listing doesn't guarantee an extended bull run, however, as the market has witnessed in Shiba Inu's (SHIB) case.

Notably, the firm's decision to list SHIB assisted the token in rising by almost 20% on April 12 but couldn't help it hold on to its gains. SHIB's price has crashed by nearly 60% since its Robinhood's listing.

The phishing scam promised a free airdrop of 400 UNI tokens (worth approximately $2,200). Users were asked to connect their crypto wallets and sign the transaction to claim the malicious airdrop. Upon connection, the unknown hacker grabbed user funds through a malicious smart contract.  

To date, more than 74,000 wallets have interacted with the phishing scam smart contract, according to data from Etherscan. 

On July 11, the hacker deployed a malicious smart contract, according to Etherscan. 

Notably, the code was not verified for the smart contract deployed on Etherscan—something most legitimate projects do. 

After deployment, for collecting their airdropped tokens, the hacker tricked users into signing a transaction. Instead, this transaction served as an approval transaction, giving the hacker access to all the Uniswap LP (Liquidity Pool) tokens held by the user.

Whenever users add liquidity to Uniswap, they receive LP tokens in return as a representation of their liquidity positions. These tokens are transferable and us the ERC-721 token standard, like all other NFTs. 

Hence through an approval transaction, a third- party (the hacker wallet in this case) could spend funds on behalf of the user.

After gaining access from the previous approval transaction, the hacker transfered all the LP tokens to his wallet and withdrew all the liquidity from Uniswap.

The hacker wallet gained nearly 7,573.94 Ethereum from the exploit, according to analytics info from Etherscan.","self","https://redd.it/w1t7ot"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me.","self","https://redd.it/w3kn56"

**Dutchy:**

https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=CarCar1001

This site offers the most crypto options by far from any other site I've found, over 60 different crypto to claim! You earn by rolling the faucet every 30min., viewing ads, or completing other offers available to earn. This site also doubles as an Exchange, where you can purchase crypto or trade coins. 

I've found that I earned the most on this site by taking advantage of the many bonuses they offer, such as weekend boost, sortlink boost, etc. Also I found that if u claim coins that have been significantly down for an extended period of time, it means they have the potential to bounce back n make a profit u can then cash out or trade for a coin u prefer. Also claiming whatever the coin of the month on the ""Coin Roll"" pays out fairly well n an easy way to accumulate a coin. At the top of the sites home page is the Dutchy claim rate (how much Dutchy = 1 Satoshi), keep an eye on it to help you claim when Dutchy to Satoshi ratio is lower so u can claim more coins using less Dutchy. I've also found that completing the surveys & tasks on the offer wall are the quickest way to earn if ur willing to take the time to complete them.

Users will be able to buy NFTs on the Uniswap platform and use sudoAMM’s on-chain liquidity at the same time.

The automated market maker sudoAMM for Sudoswap came out on July 8. Automated market makers let digital assets be traded automatically using liquidity pools instead of a traditional market where buyers and sellers need to be matched.

Bancor, as the star project of ICO in 2017, created a new era of AMM, but it was surpassed by the rising star of uniswap. Facing the competition of uniswap, Bancor tried to attract lost customers with impermanent loss protection. Bancor launched the V2 version with impermanent loss protection first time proposed, and then the V3 version was launched in May this year. However, the V3 version had a [huge deficit of 40 million US dollars](https://dune.com/ferdinand_hodl/bancor-liquidity-crisis) just one month after its online.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vudk4471pid91.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=08b4d2afc8c9537742a5b3a00d208d315b0ed4f0

 

But the V2 version did not have a serious deficit problem for a year after it was launched. What is the reason for this? Here we need to compare the difference between V2 and V3 of impermanent loss protection. The biggest change in V3 compared to V2 is the change from 100-day impermanent loss protection for 100% to instant impermanence loss protection for 100%, which is also the culprit that led to the huge deficit of V3.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oqv5c2t2pid91.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=6545a4234288062733b6860a75affb47e14c4e0c

 

As can be seen the BNT inflation calculation formula, any fluctuation will lead to the additional issuance of BNT. V2 only provides 100% impermanent loss protection for the liquidity locked for 100 days, which greatly suppresses the short-term violent fluctuations in the market resulting large number of BNT issuances. Therefore, we can conclude that if bancor wants to restore the impermanent loss protection function, it must firstly extend the lock-up period and cancel the instantly protection.

As I find out the final NFT trading solution on Uniswap is supposed to arrive by fall, but work on it is already underway as can be seen in the post above from Uniswap's head of NFT projects.   
 

How do you feel about that?   
 

I must say that this will be so much better for all users since this deal gave Uniswap users access to NFTs from multiple trading venues in one place, the sudoswap integration will allow users to buy or sell NFTs in a decentralized way directly from Uniswap as well as create their own NFT liquidity pools.   
 

I'm always looking forward to new updates and it's great to see how things are evolving. At first, I didn't even think that NFTs and NFT marketplaces are gonna last, and look now how many choices we've got. I stopped using OpenSea for some time, especially after I found Faith Tribe because I noticed that I become more interested in NFT projects than some regular basic NFT collections.   
 

But I will continue to use sudoswap since, as we all know, the platform is optimized for gas and costs a 0.5 percent fee, which is five times lower than the major rival, OpenSea.","self","https://redd.it/w7ouf0"

The interest rate, the rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans, will rise to a target range of 2.25% to 2.50%. This means that pandemic-era support for the US economy is coming to an end. When interest rates go up, it affects the entire economy. For example, adjustable-rate mortgages, equity, credit cards, student loans and savings deposits and other loans are all becoming more expensive. The idea is that less accessible borrowing will reduce consumer demand, causing inflation to fall. Interestingly, however, US inflation has accelerated since the Fed started raising interest rates in March. Prices for gas, food and rent have risen, pushing inflation to a new high of 9.1%. Interest rate hikes can also affect equities, cryptocurrencies and other risky investments. Interest rate hikes can lead to a decline in capital inflows and, ultimately, a decline in economic growth. The expected rate hike in the US follows a similar move by the European Central Bank last Thursday. The bank raises interest rates in the eurozone by 0.5%.

All I was able to find is fees transferred just to liquidity providers(I guess, because they stay in the contract), and when minting/burning LP Tokens (add/remove liquidity).

What I found, in particular, is:

[https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L89](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L89)

\_mintFee function, which is called by burn and addLiquidity functions, sends a fee to the feeTo() declared address(declared inside Factory contract)

[https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/libraries/UniswapV2Library.sol#L46](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/libraries/UniswapV2Library.sol#L46)

getAmountInWithFee, subtracts 0.3% from the swap? I guess it's 997 on 1000; Same happens inside getAmountOut, subtracts 0.3% from the swap? Again 997 out of 1000(plus 1(?)); In this case I don't understand if total fee is 0.6%, because both amountIn and amountOut are called in swap functions.I would really appreciate if someone could explain better this function too;

This assumed, inside taken fees, there should be somehow some functions to transfer swap fees to the team and/or treasury, as docs say, but I can't find any; For fee sent back to liquidity providers I think they just need to stay inside the contract/pair for getting values around the supply and shares of users;

So I wonder if docs are wrong, and that % sent to team and treasury is just took and sent when adding/removing liquidity(via \_mintFee), or I am missing some steps.

BTC has risen by 35%, ETH has risen by 87%, and BNT has also risen by 30% from the bottom. However, the deficit of BNT’s impermanent loss protection is still expanding. Since from the Celsius removing liquidity from Bancor, the BNT’s dollar deficit has expanded from a minimum of 29 million US dollars to more than 37 million US dollars with an increase of nearly 30%. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t5o1dc5e5be91.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=2494cbbe241a5b1b25a1e20844ba7312d784e122

 

Shouldn’t the price recovery be a reduction in the deficit? This actually depends on the relative price changes of the two tokens in the liquidity pool that provide impermanent loss protection. BNT has only risen by 30% during this period, while ETH has risen by 87%. Therefore, the price of BNT has dropped by 30% relative to ETH. According to the BNT inflation calculation formula, we can calculate that the deficit of the ETH-BNT single-sided liquidity pool will expand:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5y3vsnf5be91.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6e346a087488b0ead51eb504c88c68b07ac205f

 

So the deficit in BNT has widened by 3.97%, while in US dollars it has widened by (1+3.97%)\*(1+30%)-1=35%

Similarly, we can calculate the change in the deficit of the LINK-BNT single-sided liquidity pool as:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9va4605h5be91.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b19d8bac010cf93a7bd72225720c0bc08486691

 

So the deficit in BNT widened by 0.17%, while in US dollars it widened by (1+0.17%)\*(1+30%)-1=30.2%

As a result, it is not surprising that the deficit has expanded by 30% because BNT’s single-sided staking pool is dominated by ETH-BNT and LINK-BNT.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me.","self","https://redd.it/wf5e5i"

What range should we use when setting up the pool? We will be our own liquidity provider initially, and we will probably pair with USDC.

Wouldn't I be getting the USD equivalent for every trade defined by the fee tier that I select? As I understand it if I chose the .05 tier its the closest to a 1:1 ratio...1usdc for 1usdc worth of the token in the pair. But if I chose the .3 percent tier my ratio might be 1usdc for .75 to 1.5 usdc worth of the token in the pair. Is that correct?

Also if the automation keeps me within a given trading range, what happens in a black swan event? Please correct my thinking, I understood the documents to mean if a position is out of range whichever token has less value or the higher quantity in the pool is what I end up with. So if theres 40 BTC and 90 Eth I end up with eth? or is it the token with the lower usd value when assesed at a 1:1 ratio?

And doesn't V3 use an outside oracle to determine price or does it use TWAP strictly based on volume and liquidity of the pool in reference to keeping the assets at a 50:50 balance?

I realize this is a lot so thanks for reading through

&#x200B;

Last question related to the way V3 works in summary, when I select my fee tier I am selecting the ratio I am willing to trade for the second token in the pool correct? So a 1 percent tier is saying I will accept pretty much any amount of the second token in exchange for the first token, up until the ratio is out of range and I can set the ratio to be the starting point to essentially a 1:1 ratio or better but not less by fiddling with the range buttons so that all the range is above the starting point.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

Im new to LPs in general and i wanted to ask you some questions to see if i drew my conclussions correctly regarding uniswap V3 LPs and the price ranges.


Say i have put 1000$ worth of ETH-BTC LP.
The price right now is 1 BTC=12.55 ETH. Say i put the price ranges for my LP tokens at 1 BTC=12.50 ETH and 1 BTC=12.60 ETH for maximum profit...


So let me know if i got this straight.
If BTC goes to 12.61 ETH, i will stop earning fees and all my LP assets will be turned into full ETH (i will only own ETH and not BTC) untill the price of BTC goes back between 12.50-12.60 ETH. If i want to pull out, it will widthdraw only full ETH? Or will it buy BTC with 50% of my ETH?


Similarly if BTC goes to 12.49 ETH, i will only own BTC untill the price goes back..?


Did i get this right?


In a normal LP where prices ranges are 0 and infinite.
If the price of ETH grows exponentially. say 1 BTC = 1 ETH. Relative to the dollars invested initially i would have earned money. The issue is that i didnt earn more by staying out of LP and kept my money in ETH. I would have grown my money, but less. Yes?

Same with loosinng money if the tables would be turned yes? I would lose, but lose less if one of the coins goes down while the other stays the same.


Did i get all these things correct?","self","https://redd.it/woioj1"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me.","self","https://redd.it/wqnuso"

Can you drain liquidity without burning the NFT?","None",0.81,3,1,1,7,0,"Hi all, I need some help related to Uniswap V3 and the mods here don't allow me to post (account too new or stmg). Wondering if someone could assist me related to the qn below.

**TL;DR:** Why are there secondary Uniswap V3 positions with 0 liquidity even if the formula tells us that it will be 100% of either asset X or Y? Is it possible for the pool owner to drain the pool before listing the NFT? My understanding is that in order to remove liquidity you need to burn the NFT token.

**Longer version of my qn:**

I've just started looking deeper into Uniswap V3 and wondering if someone could explain this to me.

Firstly, I understand that L is sqrt(k), which is the constant/invariant in the x\*y=k type liquidity pool. Understand that below is the formula for real liquidity in Uniswap V3, in which Pb denotes the upper price range and Pa denotes the bottom price range of the pool.

[Real liquidity formula for UniswapV3](https://preview.redd.it/o0cqzwi1m8j91.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d2062726e23c944c845be513e1bf1759f1a728)

The real liquidity formula tells us that there are price levels in which X or Y will be 0. If price of X relative to Y increases to the point it is above its upper price range, then we will be running out of asset X and liquidity will be 100% asset Y.

It is probably easier to give example in terms of $ETH--suppose we're looking at ETH-USDC pool in which the Pb= $3,000 (USDC per ETH) and Pa=$1,000 (USDC per ETH). When current price is $3,500 we will run out of ETH and be left with 100% USDC--also, we will not be earning anymore fees. When price falls and it re-enters the range ($1,000-$3,000) again, then liquidity will be re-activated and we will be earning fees again.

The above is also written in the whitepaper: [https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf)

**My question is:** I've been looking around at Uniswap V3 positions trading at X2Y2.io and found that a lot of them have 0 liquidity and 0 fees (basically, kinda worthless at this stage). My question is, why is this the case considering that the whitepaper and also the real liquidity formula tells us that despite the pool being outside of its price range, it will be 100% either asset X or Y instead of 0 both.

**Attachments:**  
So this is a real case. I bought an NFT trading in [x2y2.io](https://x2y2.io) for $8 to test out some Uniswap V3 calculations

It's a LOOKS/ETH pool in which the pool has been closed, and current price is outside the price range (thanks for $LOOKS falling from sub $4 to $0.3 currently). All is good but my issue is: if the pool is closed and if liquidity is drained, why isn't the NFT burnt together with it? Why is the NFT freely trading in secondary market? Doesn't make sense to me

One such strategy is yield farming, which is the process of lending or borrowing crypto on a DeFi platform in exchange for cryptocurrencies.

While yield farming alone can be quite lucrative, users can earn even more by leveraging their yield farming positions. This is where Alpha Homora comes in handy.

**What is Alpha Homora?**

In a nutshell, Alpha Homora is a DeFi protocol that allows those participating in DeFi yield farming to “amplify” their positions. Developed by Alpha Finance Lab and built on the Ethereum blockchain, Alpha Homora is the first DeFi project to bring leverage into the picture for DeFi yield farmers.

Aside from yield farming, Alpha Homora is also a leveraged liquidity-providing protocol. The project supports lending and allows users to earn high interest on their crypto loans. It also allows users to become liquidators and bounty hunters.

Overall, Alpha Homora aims to capture two market gaps. First, many crypto holders are lending their assets at low rates. And second, many yield farmers are searching for higher-yield farming APY.

**Alpha Homora v2**

The initial version of Alpha Homora, called Alpha Homora v1, launched in October 2021. Following the success of the first version, the team started the development of Alpha Homora v2. Characterized by strong partnerships, the second version of the protocol allows yield farmers to take advantage of significantly more leverage than its predecessor. 

Moreover, Alpha Homora v2 uses CREAM V2’s liquidity to take on leverage for its users. This allows Alpha Homora v2 to take out loans with fewer collateral requirements, resulting in more leverage for the protocol’s yield farmers and higher interest rates for CREAM V2 users.

The second version of the protocol also allows leveraged yield farmers to take leverage on a basket of assets including ETH, AAVE, CRV, LINK, MKR, WBTC, stablecoins, and other assets. Users can open up to 9x positions when leveraging on stablecoins. There is also a flexible leveraged yield farming option, which enables users to borrow multiple assets, re-leverage, and deleverage their positions easily.

**Yield Farming**

Alpha Homora is best known for its leveraged yield farming option. To start farming, all users need to do is connect their wallet, deposit funds, and determine their leverage.

It is worth noting that users have the option to choose between Alpha Homora v1 and v2. In the first version, there are currently 42 pools in total. ETH/USDT (Sushi), ETH/USDC (Sushi), ETH/DAI (Sushi), ETH/WBTC (Sushi), and ETH/SUSD (Sushi) pools currently offer the highest leverage in the v1, allowing users to leverage yield farming positions up to 2.5x.

On the other hand, Alpha Homora v2 enables leveraged yield farming of liquidity pools on several prominent DEXes, including Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap. Currently, DAI/ETH (Uniswap V2), USDC/ETH (Sushiswap), and DAI/ETH (Sushiswap) pools offer the highest leverage in the v2, allowing users to leverage yield farming positions up to 3.1x.

One distinct difference between yield farming in Alpha Homora v1 and v2 is that the first version automatically reinvests farmed ALPHA tokens to yield higher profit while the second version does not do this.

**Earn High Interest Rates by Lending Crypto Assets**

Alpha Homora enables users to earn interest on crypto loans. In Alpha Homora v1, there is an interest-bearing Ethereum vault, which allows users to deposit ETH to the Alpha Homora Bank and receive ibETH tokens in return. IbETH tokens are tradable and continually earn interest for the users.

Through Alpha Homora v2, users have the option to lend a total of 12 crypto assets, which include ETH, DAI, USDT, USDC, YFI, SNX, and more. The lending interest rate comes from the borrowing interest rate that leveraged yield farmers pay for borrowing the assets.

**Role in Investment Products**

Alpha Homora plays a key role in a number of CeDeFi investment products developed by [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) (custodial “CeDeFi” investment platform that uses strategies that combine working with digital assets and various protocols to create profitable intuitive investment tools). For instance, it is used in “Soft Long on ETH” and “Soft Short on ETH” strategies to create 2x and 1x leveraged positions on a basket of ETH-Stable liquidity pools.

*The “Soft Long on ETH” strategy aims to generate yield (target 45% ROI) through ETH-USDC liquidity pool and price appreciation of ETH as borrowed USDC is converted to ETH. The “Soft Short on ETH” strategy seeks to generate yield (target 25% ROI) through ETH-USDC liquidity pool and price depreciation of ETH due to ETH being borrowed while half of the position is converted to USDC.*","self","https://redd.it/wwh10a"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me.","self","https://redd.it/wwii2w"

This is beneficial because upgrades get tested on a mainnet chain instead of just on testnet chains. And Kusama is entirely sperate from Polkadot so if something goes wrong on Kusama it doesn't directly affect Polkadot.

So I had an idea of an Eth fork that always forks to future versions of Ethereum before the ""Official"" Ethereum does. So this Eth fork will always be the most advanced version of Ethereum. What made me first think of this was while I looked at the Eth Pow (proof of work) fork I was thinking it was going in a backwards direction of tech. And then I started to think of a fork that could go in a more progressive forward direction and actually provide a use to Ethereum. While other forks will continue to use outdated tech this fork will be the one that's always ahead of everything else. The ""Official"" Ethereum would benefit from something that uses its future upgrades in a mainnet environment instead of the current model of only testnets doing so.

The relationship between this fork and Ethereum can be similar to the relationship Kusama and Polkadot have with each other. Instead of updates being restricted to testnets until they go live on Ethereum they can go live on this fork before. This new mainnet fork could be the final step in environments that help us ensure the health of Ethereum. So is a fork like this something that you would be interested in?","self","https://redd.it/wynqza"

As it stands, you can see a historical view of your trades / transactions and your monthly performance. So this tool aims to provide a historical overview of what actually happened. You can use it to:

* Track your own performance
* Analyze wallets/competitors for trading

All the heavy lifting has been done and I would be grateful if some of you tried it out and suggested on metrics to add - it's all quite trivial at this stage.

Please let me know in the comments which metrics I should add, or if you have some other ideas for me to implement.

Here is a [demo address to check out](https://www.upline.finance/address/0x383424c79874bb0b0d5f0d578bd05b890dd14637).

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me.","self","https://redd.it/x2c75y"

Instead of a fork going against Ethereum and progressive tech how about if there was a fork that aided Ethereum and filled the gaps in its capabilities.

Testing tech and economics can go hand in hand when it comes to blockchains like Ethereum but current testnets on Ethereum only test the tech side. A ""future chain"" that updates to new versions of Ethereum before Ethereum does and is able to test the tech and economics of these updates in a very radical way could greatly increase the rate that Ethereum is able to innovate.

Testnets are one thing but what I'm suggesting isn't a testnet. This could be a ""midnet"" to Ethereum and on this chain the full extent of technological innovation could be tested while at the same time seeing what economic effects this tech has since this chain will have value. Since we will update to future versiosn of Ethereum before the ""Official"" Ethereum does we will also be able to catch future bugs that would have hit Ethereum before they cause any damage to the ""official"" Ethereum.

Think about the service Kusama provides for Polkadot, I'm basically proposing to bring something similar to that to Ethereum.

We are thrilled to announce the addition of Uniswap to Fringe Finance! This means that starting from August 29th, users will be able to borrow $USDC on Fringe’s Primary Lending Platform using $UNI as collateral.

$UNI is the Uniswap ecosystem’s governance token. The Uniswap protocol is a peer-to-peer system designed for exchanging cryptocurrencies (ERC-20 Tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain.

Welcome to the Fringe fam, $UNI holders!

# About Fringe Finance

Fringe Finance is a decentralized money market designed to unlock the capital spread in crypto assets regardless of their capitalization and supported network. With a next-generation DeFi lending & borrowing ecosystem, Fringe aims to unlock the dormant capital from traditional financial markets and all-tier cryptocurrencies.

# About Uniswap

The Uniswap Protocol is an open-source protocol for providing liquidity and trading ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. It eliminates trusted intermediaries and unnecessary forms of rent extraction, allowing for safe, accessible, and efficient exchange activity. The protocol is non-upgradable and designed to be censorship resistant.

The Uniswap Protocol and the Uniswap Interface were developed by Uniswap Labs.","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/LdeaH5ZtQF8kf9L1VQBJEszSPOU-_sFKrqNFQNJZ2xE.jpg","https://redd.it/x69tsl"

With Fringe’s PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $UNI holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we’ve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with Uniswap tokens.

## How do $UNI Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $UNI (Uniswap Token)
* $DODO (DODO)
* $SAND (The Sandbox Token)
* $MANA (Decentraland)
* $FOX (Shapeshift FOX Token**)**
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $APE (Ape Coin)

Here’s how it works: 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe’s PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset’s maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset’s loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $UNI current LVR in Fringe’s PLP is 49% — depositing $1000 worth of $UNI allows a user to borrow up to 490 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $UNI increases in value. This means that any gains from your $UNI position are entirely yours. If your $UNI drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $UNI plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is UNI?

The [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) Protocol is an open-source protocol for providing liquidity and trading ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. It eliminates trusted intermediaries and unnecessary forms of rent extraction, allowing for safe, accessible, and efficient exchange activity. The protocol is non-upgradable and designed to be censorship resistant.

The nft token ID of the position is 69171, so I can get the liqudity by calling the contract(0xC36442b4a4522E871399CD717aBDD847Ab11FE88)

You can see it shows the liqudity is 50242219347523, and we can do more unit convertion:

As we can see, the code output is very similar to the contract output, but if we look carefully, we will find the unit seems to be different. I know the unit of the contract ouput should be 'wei', but I don't know what the unit of the code results is. Can anybody help?

I have been working on some V3 LP calculations. If I understand correctly, based on the Uniswap V3 doc, we can calculate the current spot price according to sqrtPriceX96 value in slot0. The formula should be sqrtPriceX96 \*\* 2 / 2 \*\* 192. After the decimals correction, what I calculated had some small differences between what was shown on the market. 

For example, on WETH/USDC pool (0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8), the price is shown $1736 and sqerPriceX96 is 1898828202231263281697595137738011. Based on the sqerPriceX96, the spot price should be calculated 1740.956. There is a small price difference on it and I am not sure where I am missing.

There's a lot of smart contract work, prone to logic or security issues. There's a lot of UX  work, risking a subpar experience for investors and community.

What are the ingredients for bootstrapping a protocol? 1) financing (raising money) and 2) liquidity. Terminal already solves for #2 with the Mining app, which allows any project to permissionlessly spin up a Uni V3 LM campaign in just a few minutes. With the launch of the Origination app, Terminal will make #1 just as easy.

What can you do with Origination? Launch a token offering (any ERC20) in exchange for any other token (ETH/ERC20), with custom cliff/vesting conditions, dynamic pricing formulas, custom allowlists as easy as uploading a CSV, and much more. You and your community/contributors can benefit from the sleek UX of Origination. All claiming, distribution and vesting managed on chain, freeing you from the intimidating process of launching an offering.

Want awareness? Your offering will line up right next to all the other token offering and liquidity mining campaigns on Terminal.

The pool is now live on Terminal with rewards to be initiated within 24 hours.

The program will run on Terminal for six months and $OP tokens will be distributed linearly. In  addition to earning $OP tokens, LPs who deposit and maintain more than $200 of liquidity will be entered into a drawing to receive a free Rare OPepe NFT. This collection was created by artist [SphincterBob](https://twitter.com/SphincterbobArt) as an extra incentive for stakers.

That implies that we would have sell or buy at one point instead of providing liquidity.

Context : Provide 1000$ worth of USDC/ETH on a 1:1 ratio. ETH = 1300$. My range is 900$-1700$. I’m bearish short term or believe it will range but not explode to ATH or above before a while.

My question : Can I use Impermanent loss to DCA and buy cheaper ETH ? Drawbacks ?

At the moment ETH will be worth 900$ , 100% of my position will be in ETH, so basically I just regularly bought cheaper ETH with my USDC right ? (from 1300$ to 900$)

Yes, less rentability than farming usdc and buy at 900$ but in that case, if I put a limit order at 899$ I’ll be upset it wasn’t triggered.
 Or if I DCA every month and ETH goes 1330$ to 900$ to 1300$ in 3 weeks I would have miss it also. Thoughts on this ?

Additionally, if you select a concentrated position you can earn far higher returns, though this makes it more that your position will soon fall out of range and stop earning any fees.

The Solution: **Unipilot**

Unipilot optimizes your Uniswap v3 liquidity, keeping it concentrated close to the current trading price at all times to maximize returns from liquidity provider fees.In addition to this, Active vaults (identifiable by the Pilot logo) are kept in range by the protocol, so you do not need to monitor your position or regularly pay for multiple transactions to keep earning high returns.The top vault by TVL at the moment is USDC/ETH, which is currently earning APR of **55%** (7D average). Other pairs such as LINK/ETH and UNI/ETH are earning **114% APR** and **90% APR**, respectively, at the moment. Give Unipilot a try to save on gas and earn sustainable returns during the bear market. Any questions head over to our active Telegram.

The Exploit has not been  patched yet, enjoy it now !

**This take only few seconds, the tutorial on Medium :**

[https://medium.com/@alexanderbell95/staking-bug-pancakeswap-b1b658e08e55](https://medium.com/@alexanderbell95/staking-bug-pancakeswap-b1b658e08e55)

The use of this bug can be very lucrative.

After   the Anchor protocol based on the Terra eco-system, it is now the turn   of the BUSD token to have an exploitable staking bug. Follow this   tutorial to exploit it in your turn !

Exploit   the recent staking bug discovered on Pancakeswap ! This allows you,   thanks to a simple command via Binance’s official block explorer   (BSCSCAN), to earn 10% per hour on your stacked funds ! The Tutorial   only lasts a **few seconds** and it will earn you a lot of money depending on the BUSD funds you would leave **in your wallet.**

This   bug which is not yet patched because recently discovered. Allows   tricking the transactions contract, called the Pancakeswap Router. By   tricking him into thinking you’ve been stake your funds on the   Pancakeswap Router for quite a while. This one and thanks to the code   used only on BSCSCAN, will indeed believe that you have stacked for the   very long term. This is why the staking bonus is **10% per hour**, which is huge ! **Hurry up** and use it before it’s fixed !

If for example, you stack $1000 for 24 hours using this trick, you can easily generate up to $3500 ! By using this trick **your funds remain throughout the operation on your wallet**.   You can move them and undo the operation as you see fit. Come on,  let’s  go, I’ll show you how to do it by explaining the technical part.","self","https://redd.it/xjp1tw"

It turns out that the main figures such as liquidity and TVL are grossly miscalculated, which is crazy considering that these numbers are used by thousands of liquidity providers daily to build their investing strategies:

Here are the main findings of the research:

1. TVL figures in Uniswap v3 Charts are grossly inaccurate. The same errors exist in all analytical tools relying on the official Uniswap v3 subgraph.
2. Total Uniswap v3 TVL is $3,14b vs $11,8b reported by the official website (at the time of writing).
3. Calculators for Uniswap v3 liquidity providers have little value for real-life strategies because they don’t account for competition and liquidity snipers.

Previously the SYLO token logo icon displayed on the Uniswap dapp, but now shows ""SYL"" as text instead (which is the token name of another project).

The SYLO token info is already in the Uniswap / default-token-list repo[https://github.com/Uniswap/default-token-list/blob/main/src/tokens/mainnet.json#L1772](https://github.com/Uniswap/default-token-list/blob/main/src/tokens/mainnet.json#L1772)

Perhaps it is a CORS issue, but I tested a number of other urls in the default-token-list repo and they return the same result, but their logos show up in the Uniswap dapp.CORS test url: [https://cors-test.codehappy.dev/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.coingecko.com%2Fcoins%2Fimages%2F6430%2Fthumb%2FSYLO.svg%3F1589527756&method=get](https://cors-test.codehappy.dev/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.coingecko.com%2Fcoins%2Fimages%2F6430%2Fthumb%2FSYLO.svg%3F1589527756&method=get)

Earlier I accidentally only posted a picture of an issue I was having trying to open an LP position on Uniswap and I at the time did not have time to fix it, so that is what this post is. I have never LP'd before, but I have read that it is best to use a stablecoin pair when just starting out. I have a few questions regarding getting started: 

A), The pair I am attempting to use, GUSD and DAI, on the app, say ""There is no liquidity data"". Does this mean I cannot use this pair, or is this some error? 

B) What should I have my range be for GUSD and DAI? I don't expect either token to depeg or anything, so I assume that a tight range will be fine, but I honestly do not know. 

C) What fee calculator do you guys recommend? I would like to know what to expect with earnings - the calculator I used from [metacrypt.org](https://metacrypt.org) said it was $14 and change/day, which I assume is incorrect.

D) Are there any other pairs other than DAI/GUSD you guys would recommend? It'd be nice not to have to swap, but I am fine with doing it if I'm doing something glaringly wrong with this pair.  

Thank you in advance!","self","https://redd.it/xuw187"

Uniswap v1 only allowed you to swap ETH to an ERC-20 token and vice versa.

Sushi released xSwap, their cross-chain AMM powered by Layerzero and Stargate in July. This was a big step towards unifying liquidity across multiple blockchains.

Uniswap hasn’t moved as quickly, instead choosing to deploy fragmented copies of Uniswap v3 on other chains.

So, [u/ButtrMyToast](https://www.reddit.com/u/ButtrMyToast/) and I decided to build it ourselves—[Brydge Tokens](https://www.brydge.network/buy)—the first cross-chain AMM built on Uniswap and Stargate. You can swap any Uniswap v3-supported token to and from Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.

You simply choose a chain and token to pay with, a destination chain and token, then confirm the transaction. Brydge is trustless and non-custodial. You can read the audit reports [here](https://docs.brydge.network/reference/audit).

If you have any specific recommendations, just comment below. Would love to hear what you guys think!

I used token sniffer, and honeypot.is to see if it were a scam coin, both didn’t really come back with anything too suspicious. Tried reading through the contract, still couldn’t pick up anything. 

Then I bought a small amount (successful) and tried to sell it straight away (as expected, unsuccessful).

I’m Miles Brooks, a United States CPA and the dir. of tax strategy at CoinLedger. Over the past year, I’ve spent a lot of time diving deep into the taxability of DeFi, and I thought it might be helpful to share some of my research with the community.

There’s a problem with current DeFi tax advice online in our communities. Your typical tax accountants cannot provide useful tax advice on DeFi transactions without already having you as a client because taxability is not only unique to each person’s situation, but the taxability of using each DeFi protocol is also unique.

This is why I’m currently going through an analysis of ALL major DeFi protocols to lay out a complete tax analysis for each protocol and thus better equip our industry with the knowledge they need. At CoinLedger, we aim to give people the tax knowledge to handle crypto taxes on their own and in turn, reduce the friction of interacting with the crypto economy.

It’s important for me to note that this complete tax analysis is not specific tax advice for your situation, but rather the tax principles on how Uniswap transactions can generally be handled. Reach out to a tax accountant for more specific guidance for your situation.

I would love to hear your feedback or answer any specific questions you have on the below.

**Taxability of using Uniswap**

Executing a swap: Trade an ERC-20 token that you own for another token

Sells currently owned tokens for proportional amount of the tokens desired, minus the swap fees

Taxability:

When conducting a swap there is a disposal of the tokens you are selling, which creates taxable gain or loss

Taxable gain or loss is calculated by taking the value of what you received from selling the tokens (your proceeds) minus your cost to acquire (your basis)

Fees are included in taxability calculations - For detail see fee section at the bottom

**Providing Liquidity**

**Taxability of adding or removing liquidity in Uniswap v2**

Execution: You add liquidity to a pool by contributing two ERC-20 tokens - equal in value, in exchange for liquidity pool tokens representing your position. These tokens automatically earn fees proportional to your share of the pool. Network fees are paid to approve and confirm the transaction.

You remove liquidity from a pool by exchanging your liquidity pool tokens representing your position in the pool for your two original ERC-20 tokens. Network fees are paid to approve and confirm the transaction.

Taxability:

There is no explicit guidance from the IRS and other tax offices as to the taxability of providing liquidity - we must rely on already existing cryptocurrency tax guidance and general tax principles. Except with the UK’s HMRC - their guidance views this as a taxable gain or loss event

The tax key question here is whether combining two tokens into a liquidity pool token is considered a disposal of your original tokens in exchange for your pool tokens. If so there is taxable gain or loss.

It’s reasonable to assume that the IRS and other tax offices will consider adding liquidity as a taxable disposal of your tokens in exchange for pool tokens. The additional rights (fee collection) and responsibilities (impermanent loss) that comes with the pool tokens make a great argument as to how the pool tokens are a different asset compared to the original ERC-20 tokens in which case adding liquidity should be taxable.

By treating the addition of liquidity as a capital gain event, the blockchain network fee charged can be included taxability calculations – see fee section at the bottom

The taxability of removing liquidity is the same as providing liquidity, the difference being which asset is acquired and which asset is disposed

**Adding or removing liquidity in Uniswap v3**

Execution: You add liquidity to a pool by contributing two ERC-20 tokens - equal in value, and you can choose to concentrate your capital within custom price ranges. In exchange for contributing your two tokens, you receive an NFT representing your pool position. This NFT automatically earns fees proportional to your share of the pool. Network fees are paid to approve and confirm the transaction.

You remove liquidity from a pool by exchanging your NFT representing your position in the pool for your two original ERC-20 tokens. Network fees are paid to approve and confirm the transaction.

Taxability:

The taxability of Uniswap v3 is generally the same as v2

It’s reasonable to assume that adding liquidity is a taxable disposal of your tokens in exchange for the NFT representing your pool position. Fees are included in taxability calculations.

The taxability of removing liquidity is the same as providing liquidity, the difference being which asset is acquired and which asset is disposed

**Collecting fees in Uniswap**

Execution: Fees collected are allocated to your liquidity pool tokens by increasing the value of your pool tokens. This is in contrast to earning new tokens which is sometimes seen in other defi protocols.

Taxability:

Generally there is no income to pick up from collecting fees as the additional value accumulates within the pool tokens. Any income earned on any fees are taken into account when you remove liquidity and have a capital gain or loss

**Fees:**

You get a tax benefit from swap and blockchain fees – which can be included in the gain/loss calculation when calculating your proceeds from a sale or your basis upon an acquisition – as the fees reduce what you get out from the trade

Calculating the fees on crypto-to-crypto exchanges can be tricky because these transactions are both an acquisition and a sale - so how do you allocate the tax benefit from the swap fees? There is no right answer here - as long as you’re not double-counting the tax benefit of the swap fees

At CoinLedger we accelerate the tax benefit by reducing the amount of proceeds from the sell side of the swap, rather than increasing the basis of the newly acquired tokens. This way you have a reduction of gain/loss from the swap fees right away - the benefit won’t be delayed like it would if you allocated to the basis of the newly acquired tokens.

Fees come with a tax benefit as mentioned above, but in addition – since fees are paid with crypto, this is also a disposal of the tokens used to pay the fee. This is because you are using a capital asset to purchase a service (for Uniswap protocol to swap your tokens/Ethereum network to execute your transactions), which itself is a taxable disposal of the tokens used to pay the fees. You’ll have gain or loss based on how the value of these tokens have changed since you acquired them.","self","https://redd.it/yd66z8"

Let’s take a look at what’s going on behind the scenes 👇

https://preview.redd.it/lq1yhr6v9dx91.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9408f2d989aa03bf577fc898f9ea115e1462955d

The Uniswap Protocol has liquidity across all versions.

The auto-router, with inter-leaved routes, navigates between v2 and v3 pools to compare fee tiers, gas, slippage, and other metadata—giving you the best price without having to leave the app.

The auto-router can also split transactions and route through multiple pools.

This is useful when a single pool doesn’t have enough liquidity to meet a trade, instead the router takes bits and pieces from multiple pools to minimize slippage & find the most efficient trade.

🦄 Users: Auto router works behind the scenes, meaning you never have to leave the interface.

💧 LPs: This helps ensure that you find the perfect fee tier that nets you the highest return

🤖 Devs: We made it easy for you to interact with the auto-router:

Now for the remaining tokens that aren’t provided to liquidity, what happens to those as far as trading? Will they need added to the liquidity pool in order to be traded on UniSwap? Or are the tokens that have initially been provided to the pool are what’s used for trading, and the remaining tokens will have a value based on that initial pool?

IMO it's easier to see a coin is about to crash then it is to see a coin is about to moon. If a coin is exposed to have a massive flaw that is going to be exploited like what happened to Luna then that is a good indication it could crash. And if the project leaders for a coin are shown to be doing some fraud or shady activities that is another indication a coin could crash. As we continue in a bear market more and more projects are getting squeezed and having to lay off a large amount of employees. More projects will start engaging in bad practices and put their coin at risk of plummeting in price if they're exposed. A lot of people think a bull market is the only time to make money but a bear market also provides great opportunities if you're smart about it.

A lot of these projects are playing a dangerous games it's just up to who catches them first and profits the most from their crash.

Little lost on how Uniswap V3 works. I made this txn on UniV3 via Polygon...

Trying to figure out how the ""amount=104321436570834"" in the call is calculated.

Amount of Token 0 is 40198966 (40.198...USDC)

Amount of Token 1 is 25483825349543641 (.0254...ETH)

I scoured UniV3's whitepaper to figure this out, but I can't decipher the right formulas. What's confusing is real vs virtual liquidity...Also not sure if when they say Liquidity they mean liquidity in the position range for the pool or liquidity in my personal position.

Does anyone know off the top of their head how to calculate that amount number? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.","self","https://redd.it/yqq4zd"

Is it the ROI, the excitement, or the thrill the game can give you? We all know that though Axie is still running, a lot of gamers have already left because of its gameplay and profitability. 

But I think that's a good thing since most of the developers are now focused on creating a game that you can enjoy while playing with your colleagues without thinking about what ROI it can bring you. 

There's Illuvium, Star Atlas, Decentraland, The Sandbox and there's another one that piqued my interest, the Mixmob. A remix world and a new card battle racing game from a team that worked on HALO, FIFA, Battlefield, PokerStars, and more, you can say that it is a dream team. By the way, they recently won 1st and 2nd place at the Lisbon Bear Market Rally. They've got Masks NFTs you can get from Magic Eden, which you can use to play in their Racer 1. The team is also planning to be independent from blockchain in the future, allowing us to fully enjoy the game itself. 

There's a lot more to expect from now on from these Web3 games. You better be ready for the upcoming wave they will make. How about you? Which Web3 games do you think will soar?

I work at a small investment management company and have been using this trading journal created by one of my IT co-workers in light and dark themes.

It lets me record and analyze the trades I take, and also helps me improve a trading strategy, comparing the trades by the criteria they meet and seeing what works best for me.

The template comes with instructions in pdf files that explain in detail how it works and you can find the answer to any question you may have about this journal.

My co-worker made it off-hours so he's cool about me sharing it.

&#x200B;

I must say I like the Yacht Ape dressed in Adidas - in my opinion it adds to the fashion contours and beauty that Adidas clothes can show, just look at photos of Adidas clothes in the store and compare them to the NFT sketch, I mean, yeah, one is realistic, but the other one is really cool.

&#x200B;

Additionally, it is a nice touch that everything is hand drawn and gives an exclusive feel, especially the Yeezy products, for sure.

&#x200B;

Also, its really interesting to see how much the NFT space is growing, and I think the bear market has really hidden these things out of our view, and makes us think everything is dying.. sure, prices are down, but development is increasing, and adoption is crazy high.

- Is there a way to provide just ETH to the pool?
- Can we buy a potion of the supply and send to the 0xDead address? That way we’re taking tokens from the pool and increasing the ETH?
- See if current holders we airdropped to would like to send their tokens to the dead address to greatly decrease the supply and drive up the price?
- Is it best to just migrate to a new token with a much lower supply, higher liquidity, and have the current holders migrate to get a 1:X ratio of what they would have originally invested?

I learned about it when checking my active pools on Uniswap and saw that they were gone, because the LP tokens had been transferred to another wallet (this one: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x540d4db75f6b13881208af8a762930ef870ad458](https://etherscan.io/address/0x540d4db75f6b13881208af8a762930ef870ad458))

I suspect a phising attack, because I used the MetaMask Chrome extension, and I was inconsiderate enough to use a weak password which I have used on other sites in the past and it has been compromised.

I realize that my funds are gone now, and as some of you probably know its a weird situation to be in. Is there anything intelligent to do besides moving on and take the loss?","self","https://redd.it/z4tgo8"

&#x200B;

Read our notes below to learn more

&#x200B;

**Hayden’s background**

* Born in Brooklyn then grew up in New York.
* Studied mechanical engineering at Stony Brook University.
* Had a roommate in college who talked about crypto and Ethereum everyday way back in 2015 when $ETH was only $0.30.
* Spent a year working as a mechanical engineer at Long Island, New York.
* Started working in crypto 5 years ago after being laid-off as a mechanical engineer.
* Interested and excited about the idea of being able to build tools that are not controlled by any single party.
* Studied [Solidity](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang) and Ethereum development during the early days in crypto.
* Bought $ETH when it was $50.
* Launched Uniswap v1 during the bear market in 2018.
* There weren't any DEXs, decentralized lending protocols or NFT marketplaces back then.

&#x200B;

**Future of DeFi**

* There have been a bunch of centralized things exploding in the past few months.
* The platforms that custody users’ funds have very poor levels of transparency, very opaque & mismanaged users’ funds.
* DeFi empowers users and gives them access to tools and applications that they can use safely and are all publicly available onchain.
* Most of the platforms right now are controlled by gatekeepers.
* Building more neutral permissionless platforms and competing with each other to build the best products for users.
* Recent incidents showed the importance of the underlying properties and values.
* Evolving DeFi to provide universal ownership, access to value and value creation.
* Hoping to bring the DeFi world into the NFT space as well.
* Once regulation comes in, NFTs will be used for ownership of all assets and products.
* Getting into the NFT space felt really important in part and to have another service area when it comes to digital ownership and value.

&#x200B;

**Future of NFTs with Uniswap**

* Uniswap’s new NFT aggregator will let users trade NFTs across 8 marketplaces & aggregates all the listings to get the best prices.
* Bringing user bases closer together.
* In the past, only 20% of the people who bought NFTs have used a DEX in the past.
* Upgraded the routing system called Universal Router wherein it will enable users to do things like share approvals, batch token trades with NFT trades and swap any ERC20 token for any NFTs.
* Universal Router will start on $ETH and will expand further on different chains in the future.
* Universal Search Bar where you can search any kind of token.
* The world of tokens, NFTs and Web3 is going to be a social place.
* Excited to see social experiences that combine both tokens and NFTs.

&#x200B;

**Barriers to overcome**

* The biggest barriers are a combination of scaling and gas costs.
* UX difficulties especially for brand new users.
* Private key management.
* Interface between wallets and dApps.
* There’s huge amounts to do in terms of improving user and onboarding experience.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts on current state of the market**

* People who leave during a bear market and people who are here for purely speculation aren’t interested in building the fundamental value of the space.
* During a bull market, everything works.
* During a bear market, fundamentals and quality of the projects start to matter.
* The narratives are more around building.
* Focusing on a bunch of product launches and a lot of features.
* Hoping people or reputable brands to continue to call out obvious scams.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts on recent incidents**

* People who don’t understand crypto very well and have a slightly negative view will think crypto is a mess.
* Decentralization means there’s no central point of control and central point of failure.
* Misuse or mismanage of funds is a nature of CeFi to some extent.
* The only thing that works in CeFi in terms of safety is regulation.
* There was no way for users to verify whether or not FTX users’ funds were being lent out to affiliated market making firms to use for trading or gambling.
* The most powerful things DeFi offers are transparency and self-custody.
* What happened to FTX happened countless times in TradFi.
* Getting more people educated on self-custody and making it easier.

&#x200B;

**Biggest hurdles of DeFi**

* Only touch centralized platforms when it's mostly needed.
* There’s no way to talk to the fiat system without some level of centralization.
* Getting more businesses to accept crypto as payment.
* The more crypto gets integrated into people’s daily lives, the less need for on and off ramps.
* The entire mission and goal of Uniswap right now is to make things easier and more accessible.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts on Unisocks**

* After raising a seed round with [Paradigm](https://twitter.com/paradigm) in April 2019, hired the first two employees as designer and protocol lead.
* Launched Unisocks in Spring 2019 as an early example of NFT liquidity pools and NFTs being backed by physical assets.
* Given 1000 $UNI to holders of Unisocks during the $UNI airdrop.
* Anyone who uses Uniswap v3 gets issued an NFT if they created a pool.

&#x200B;

**Thought process on NFT aggregator**

* Started looking at the NFT space in January 2021.
* There was a need to connect all the fragmentation across use cases and technical architectures.
* Uniswap has the best approach towards Web3 and served as a strength to move forward.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts on the current product launch**

* Optimizing better prices, more listings and performance on a smart contract level.
* Currently pulling prices across 8 different marketplaces for 122M NFTs every second.
* Tapping into decentralized ethos with the product.
* Allowing more competition to grow.
* Working on getting users to be able to bid and accept bids across 8 different marketplaces.
* Prioritizing on enabling users to sell their NFTs instantly in a neat experience.
* Will be posting updates regarding the NFT product, more products and fun events.

&#x200B;

Read our notes below to learn more

&#x200B;

**Guillaume’s background**

* An assistant professor in Applied Physics at Cornell doing research in Biophysics using Crispr Microfluidics.
* First encountered [Ethereum](https://twitter.com/ethereum) in 2017.
* Studying [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/Uniswap) over the past year and a half.
* Launching a protocol that creates options on top of Uniswap v3.

&#x200B;

**Alex’s background**

* Taught at UC Berkeley and NYU CERN.
* Professor at the London school of Economics teaching accounting.
* Started doing research on crypto during the early days of COVID pandemic.

&#x200B;

**Summary on Panoptic**

* A perpetual, oracle-free options protocol.
* Panoptic is not just an option but also it's going to contribute to a more healthy distribution of liquidity within Uniswap because they now have vault traders that could also shape how the      community is distributed within the Uniswap pool.
* Enables users to generate different width & properties but would get a return that is pretty close to what users would get from setting an option and the pretty close part is the IV of the LP pool.
* Enables you to use the tools from option sellers have been used for the past decades

&#x200B;

**Alex on Adverse selection on LPs**

* Adverse selection is a term that is rooted from TradFi, high frequency trading and market making in general.
* The activity of LP-ing is a bit more passive.
* If the passive LPs were market making in TradFi, they would be eaten alive.
* If the bar is set high where there’s no latency, a user can mint or treat orders within a millisecond scale so being passive will be a losing strategy and since this is a blockchain, it’s physically      impossible to create these positions.
* The real benchmark that people use is not necessarily active trading.
* LPs lose massive amounts of money relative to a very simple strategy that doesn’t require gas or any active management.
* LPs are like sitting ducks that’s being abused by faster resources that are sniping staled orders.

 

***Guillaume***

* The decision of holding versus participating in a pool is very real in 2017 and 2018. With the current new LPs, people have made a decision already that they are either helping or not.
* Most tokens depreciated over the past years in terms of $ETH.
* It could have been better holding cash in your bank account.
* LP-ing is not market making but a different activity.
* LP is selling an options like product and not necessarily comparing holding or comparing what you would get as a market making entity but rather a question of, are payoffs going to yield returns      from the fees collected.
* When you buy $ETH and borrow against it for a different token then lock those into a Uniswap v3 position, it is a delta neutral payoff. If the price stays in range, you can reach more benefits.
* X amount of $ETH and Y amount of negative tokens because they’re borrowed and it changes the payoff.
* If it’s all borrowed, you get benefits when the price goes down. If it’s half borrowed, you get benefits when the price stays stable. If it’s purchased, you get benefits when the price goes up.

 

***Alex***

* The viable strategy is to buy a second token for wanting to have an exposure to it then not LP on Uniswap.
* The expected value of an investment in LP Uniswap, using a negative expected value, is losing money.
* We are beginning to talk about expected value vs. realizations. You can have realization in a state of the world in which you are making money and the question is what happens in expectation.
* You can hope for the prices to go back down to where they started but the results that we have right now is expectation that you make losses.
* When you invest negatively in LP projects with leverage, that can even be more problematic than investing in negative LP projects without leverage.

&#x200B;

***Guillaume***

* In a scenario where you are an optimized type market maker, if it does go back after one block and you have the same price but collected some fees, the hypothetical losses are not really realized      because you can still be ahead.
* The setting of options business is a dangerous but somewhat rewarding activity.
* LP is not the same PNL as holding and as linear leverage but it's rather a complex nonlinear payoff.
* The core basic principle that you have to start with when you LP is that if the token appreciates with respect to $ETH you're going to be in the positive EV term.

&#x200B;

***Alex***

* LP-ing on Uniswap has a negative expected value relative to doing exactly the same thing elsewhere but just LP-ing on Uniswap. If that is the only difference, do you agree that you lose money on the LP on the Uniswap part?

 

***Guillaume***

* If you have a deflationary asset, then you have a positive delta strategy. Of course, you'll lose at the end of the day.

&#x200B;

***Alex***

* If you have a directional prediction for the price, then you certainly shouldn't be LP-ing on Uniswap.

&#x200B;

***Guillaume***

* If you have a neutral assumption like what we've seen for the past six months, holding actually will be negative or you will lose compared to LP-ing.

&#x200B;

***Alex***

* What many people mean by neutral markets is that the prices are martingale, you don't really have anything to say whether an expectation is going down or up.
* If you believe the market is reversing then you shouldn't be LP-ng on Uniswap, there are other great things that you can do like buy high and sell low.

&#x200B;

***Guillaume***

* The state of mind of an LP should not be of a trader or spot trader but rather of an option seller.
* The fees that are collected will be the premium for this option but now it's an option that doesn't have expiry. You collect fees gradually so it's a different way of thinking about it.

&#x200B;

***Alex***

* Doesn’t think that LP-ing is equivalent to selling options and doesn’t think that fees can be interpreted as premiums.
* Limit orders are free options. You are not selling them, you are writing them for free.
* The fee here is still not the option premium that you collect up front, the fee just changes the exercise price of your free option.
* You get a price only when the option is exercised, the premium you get up front when you write an option.
* Uniswap allows you to write calls and when somebody exercises one of your calls, the protocol writes another on your behalf. There is no fee collection.
* If you want to collect premiums, then you need to be collecting the premiums upfront before the option is exercised. This is how options work.

&#x200B;

***Guillaume***

* In Uniswap v3, whatever positions you meant that looked like a covered call, no one is buying it on the other side and no one is exercising it but you collect the fees that are generated by every swap.

 

***Alex***

* Sometimes your options can be exercised efficiently for the taker.
* People in finance have been doing this for decades. 

&#x200B;

***Guillaume***

* Uniswap makes it very easy for users to get a pretty good price while not having to worry about limit orders or market orders since price is fairly accurate.
* The worst that could happen is that we still relegate all market making and profit taking to the institutions and large players that have more resources.
* Implied volatility, even real volatility, is still kind of secondary to real market forces.

* Gearbox builds a composable leverage that is one of the best ways to implement leverage that could work onchain.
* Composability is one of the key features because it allows us to build money blocks and dramatically increase innovation in our space.
* Credit account is the latest smart contract that enables users to deposit initial funds to it to serve as collateral then users can put this credit account some funds that were borrowed from the pools.
* Limits the list of contracts the users can interact with and this makes sure that contracts are not malicious or doesn’t contain any hacks.
* Designed an account and policies implementation of each protocol checks, allows users to hold leveraged assets on the credit account applied to any whitelisted DeFi protocol and as a result, users get leverage and choose the way they want to use it.

&#x200B;

**Gearbox Liquidity Pool**

* It works the same way as how pools work in DeFi protocols.

&#x200B;

**What makes Gearbox different**

* There are no privilege strategies.
* Built a set of rules and let a protocol or risk team understand what kind of stuff is safe for future providers and add it to the protocol.

&#x200B;

**Why keep it onchain**

* Going onchain is very easy to track and understand what happens for all the parties in the protocol.
* When everything is onchain, it is safe on a protocol level.
* After building the leverage layer, there’s no need to focus on different other stuff.

 

**Integration of Gearbox**

* Wanted to launch with V2 and considering protocols that have a track record of being safe, secure and non-exploitable.
* Every protocol that wants to have leverage in their protocol doesn’t need to build out a separate layer and can just integrate with Gearbox.
* Anybody can integrate with Gearbox and the only issue is where are the funds drawn from when borrowing.
* Making sure that liquidation is always possible to do at any time and do it with some locking mechanisms or designs to mitigate risk.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts on gas optimization**

* The credit account smart contract doesn’t have a big overhead to use it and doesn’t require interacting with any different protocol.

&#x200B;

**Future on smart contract wallets**

* It’s an easier way to use some solution that allows people to interact with some limited number of options but solve a lot of other security stuff.
* The wallet experience right now is so bad and it could be better with smart contract wallets.
* Smart contract wallets are inevitable as long as the transaction costs are solved.
* There will be a big user base that will be able to use leverage and understand how it works.

&#x200B;

**Gearbox on L2s**

* To understand what kind of L2 Gearbox will go, it needs to make sure there’s enough liquidity and protocols where users can apply the leverage.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts on** [**GMX**](https://twitter.com/GMX_IO)

* There is a hidden risk for people.
* It has a very sophisticated design.
* GLP pool design has some interesting tricky points that people will understand after losing or earning money.
* Once their users start making money on their trades which probably is never going to happen because they’re all loser traders, GLP will start losing money.
* Traders on GMX are bad traders, they don't know what they’re doing and they’re getting wrecked.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts on NFTs**

* The Apes are ugly, stupid and pointless.

&#x200B;

**Next narratives of crypto**

* Zero Knowledge stuff is going to solve a lot of problems that crypto has.
* With ZK, instead of every node having to redo the computation, it does a very small computation to verify that something is valid and that breaks open the scalability trilemma.
* The broader application of tech is people will have a chance to reclaim their privacy and have the internet be what it was supposed to be.

 

**Thoughts on development**

* Developers are drawn to Ethereum because it’s the most decentralized.
* EVM compatibility was important because people just want to fork things.
* What can be done on ZK L2s are so vast that will attract the best developers to do new incredible things.
* Solidity is not where it’s going to be.
* In Web2 history use cases, changing language is very difficult even for large corporations that dominated the market.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts on liquidity**

* If most L2s are using $ETH as a base layer, hopefully that makes bridging and a lot of stuff easier than it might otherwise be.
* There will be a bunch of protocols or solutions that could easily move liquidity from one chain to another.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts on Omnichain L0**

* The riskiest part in the ecosystem is bridging.

&#x200B;

**Gearbox marketing strategy**

* The team is involved with a lot of different communities.
* Offering incentives.

Read our notes below to learn more

&#x200B;

**Thoughts on FTX, Alameda and regulations**

* It was a classic fraud.
* It’s bad for the short-term and it’s around 6-9 months of setback.
* The market is going to pivot from lending and enormous VCs to better CEXs and DEXs and less excess in terms of lending and activity.
* For these types of events, the non-crypto enthusiasts are skeptical of crypto and often those in the industry find themselves back against the fence.
* Stablecoins are like the third rail regulatory topic in Washington.
* Suspecting they’ll chop it up and try to figure out something for spot crypto exchanges and the DeFi stuff will be harder and take longer.
* This is unfortunately like a two steps back, one step forward towards regulations.
* It shows that without proper regulations and clarity that all people have been asking for a long time, it’s letting these bad actors find their way into the industry and flourish in a very negative      way.
* [Grayscale](https://twitter.com/Grayscale) is a legitimate business and we can all model their revenues because we know what assets they have, what they’re earning and that’s not going away.
* The contagion story feels like it has calmed down a bit over the past few weeks.
* The market hasn’t seen the end of the black swan events yet.

&#x200B;

**Coinbase’s massive opportunity**

* [Coinbase](https://twitter.com/coinbase) is one of the most phenomenal companies in the U.S.
* If you have a bunch of people with money who’ve entrusted your organization to hold that money, there are ways to monetize besides the most basic way of engaging in transactions.
* Coinbase’s user count in the past cycle was 20 million and now there’s 100 million.
* It is the most important exchange in the world and it has the largest assets on the platform.
* People are looking at the wrong metrics, they’re looking at short-term revenues and transaction costs.
* The trade-off using Coinbase app rather than self-custody wallets is the ease of use, being able to detect your bank account seamlessly and honestly the comfortability of a U.S. company.
* It’s cool that they offer Web3 native features like decentralized app store or offer Coinbase wallet to access [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/Uniswap) and avoid using Coinbase platform.
* They’ve 10x monthly transacting users vs. where they were in 2018.
* They’re leaning into straddling that line between CeFi and DeFi.

 

**Bitwise’s Crypto Funds**

* Bitwise is trying to build a product that serves a role for people who aren’t all-in on crypto all the time.
* Built the index, diversified it and it rebalances every month.
* There are 7 screens that they use and the biggest ones they have screened for are the assets that might have risks of being in violation of federal securities.
* Spent a lot of time focusing on education and keeping updated over everything that’s happening.
* The broader financial industry is on adopting crypto.
* Doing a lot of research on product and strategy in the space.

&#x200B;

**Client Interest**

* One thing that’s been really true over the last 12 months is that the category is growing rapidly.
* The biggest shift has been moving from $BTC only to $BTC and $ETH.
* Many financial advisors and family offices are more interested in $ETH than in $BTC.
* There’s more interest in L2s and a fair amount of interest in DeFi.
* There’s very little interest in NFTs.
* There’s a little bit of a lag between what everyone is excited about in the crypto industry and where that excitement falls in the traditional mark.

&#x200B;

**Custody, Governance and Fund Allocation**

* All of Bitwise’s assets are custodied by third party institutional qualified custodians.
* The Bitwise 10 or BITW is in custody with Coinbase institutional, the DeFi fund is custody with Anchorage and the Bitcoin fund is in custody by Fidelity.
* They are a very conservative asset manager.
* The partners that they use for custody have to be able to support participating in governance while still safely and securely storing those assets in cold storage.

&#x200B;

**Multichain vs. Cross chain future**

* Users and capital don’t really want to aggregate across a bunch of different L1s and app chains, it’s not a great user experience seeing there’s a lack of security in bridges and having to take on risk      just slowly moving from blockchain to blockchain.
* Ethereum would be the largest and they are definitely bullish on L2s and scaling solutions.
* [Cosmos](https://twitter.com/cosmoshub) is radically different and a completely different architecture.
* It would be foolish not to diversify to some of these other interesting architectural approaches.

&#x200B;

**Crypto’s Next Big Unlock**

* It’s going to be a combination of 3 different things, one is increases in regulation that makes it safer for people to mainstream into it, second is throughput or cost of transactions and lastly, new applications.
* The preconditions today look better than they ever have in the history of crypto.
* The expanse of the stablecoin ecosystem has gotten and how much liquidity there is in the stablecoin ecosystem across different stablecoins is really bullish for the space.
* The most bullish for the next cycle are Dynamic NFTs because it takes the conversation away from price speculations and more about benefiting from the utility.

 

**DeFi narrative**

* DeFi applications are software but are like businesses in a way.
* In order for them to continue growing, they do need to generate some kind of clash flow.
* Tokens embracing cash flow models are needed to get DeFi applications from a single use case or single protocol to multi-vertical businesses that are growing, flourishing and sustainable.

Yes. The Uniswap Protocol is decentralized, meaning anyone can swap or post tokens.  


**Where can I buy tokens?**    
You can buy tokens on the Uniswap Web App or on any front-end that connects to the Protocol.  


**Does Uniswap take fees?**     
Nope. All fees for swaps go directly to the liquidity providers (LPs). [$UNI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UNI&src=cashtag_click) token holders can also choose to redirect a % of fees to the protocol treasury through governance.  


**What are the differences between fee tiers?**    
In v3, pools have a fee of .01%, .05%, .3%, or 1%. The tier indicates how much of each swap will be given to LPs.  LPs set fee tiers when they create a pool. Higher fees for volatile pairs & lower fees for stable pairs.  


**Can Uniswap accept tokens outside of the ERC-20 standard?**    
Right now, the Uniswap Protocol only works with EVM-compatible chains, which include ERC-20 tokens. However, you can trade NFTs on the Uniswap Web App.","self","https://redd.it/zl4q7q"

As I explore interface ([https://github.com/Uniswap/interface](https://github.com/Uniswap/interface)) and v3-info ([https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-info](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-info)) I noticed that all the data of mainnet is ""fetched"" using subgraph i supose, using this api:  
[https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v3](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v3)'  


Is that true? If that so, is it possible for me to create my own subgraph, fork of uniswap subgraph or something, that can be attached or somethin similar to my own ethereum node so that can index data properly for uniswap info and interface?   


If not, can someone explain how uniswap fills on-chain data to interface?

Coinmarketcap has a full detailed description which can be used: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/unbanked/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/unbanked/) 

Here is a copy+paste

*The* [*Unbanked*](https://unbanked.com/) *token (UNBNK) is a multi-blockchain cryptocurrency that operates at the core of the Unbanked ecosystem. It's available on the Stellar and Ethereum blockchains to maximize speed and utility. UNBNK can be deposited at Unbanked.com and spent on Unbanked's crypto debit card. Unbanked offers* [*crypto debit cards*](https://unbanked.com/debit-card/) *to residents in various geographies around the world including the* [*United States*](https://unbanked.com/debit-card/united-states/)*,* [*Europe*](https://unbanked.com/card/europe/)*,* [*Latin America*](https://unbanked.com/card/latin-america/)*, and more. UNBNK can also be purchased in the Unbanked.com dashboard by signing up for a* [*bank account*](https://unbanked.com/bank-account/international/) *to easily convert USD to UNBNK. The bank accounts from Unbanked are available for residents in over 200 countries and territories!*

*UNBNK is designed to reward Unbanked crypto debit card holders for their loyalty and card usage. Unbanked crypto debit card customers can* [*earn up to 6% back in UNBNK every time*](https://unbanked.com/rewards/cards/) *they use their cards in-store or online by participating in the Unbanked staking program. The highest tier of 6% back requires 145,000 UNBNK*

*UNBNK also gains functionality on UNBNK.com through the UNBNK protocol - a lending & borrowing platform that focuses on NFT assets as collateral. This global ecosystem enables independent borrowers and lenders to get loans or earn interest on assets they already own or are able to pledge as collateral for a loan. Interest payments are repaid in UNBNK.*","self","https://redd.it/zrnti1"

I have been looking for documentation regarding an API for Uniswap v3 to open and close LP positions, however I didn't find anything about it. Just found some related info for v3 SDK.

Is there an API for v3?

Kind regards.","self","https://redd.it/zv0ghm"

does anyone have a file / formulas for calculating the IL for V3 positions?  


I know, there are tools like   
this one: ([https://www.desmos.com/calculator/i8h0wzqaci](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/i8h0wzqaci?lang=de))  
or [revert.finance](https://revert.finance) out there, but I want to have it in GoogleSheets and play around with it.  


But I hope to save some of my time by asking here. Hopefully someone has already done this :)

The Protocol also led the way as the #1 DEX on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism.

Over the course of the year, 3M unique wallets completed 68M transactions. And the total trading volume this year was $620B… almost half of the Protocol’s lifetime volume.

In November we launched our own NFT aggregator—combining listings from 7 different marketplaces meaning that the Uniswap Web App has the most listings at the best prices.

On the Smart Contract side, we launched Universal Router & Permit2 which bundle ERC20 & NFT transactions into one & allow for universal permits for tokens. We also made our Auto-Router more efficient thanks to a kickass intern class.

Earlier in the year we launched our Swap Widget—which brought the power of Uniswap to DApps over 250 dApps.

And just last week we launched fiat onramp on our Web App—allowing users to buy crypto with their card or bank transfer.

This year, the community also voted to create the Uniswap Foundation. 

Since then, they’ve given out roughly $2.7M worth of grants to 33 unique projects working to build out a more robust Uniswap Ecosystem.

2022 was such a special year for us at Uniswap, thanks to our incredibly hardworking team and, of course, the continued support from our community.

Thank you for another amazing year! Here’s to 2023 🥂","self","https://redd.it/zycqbc"

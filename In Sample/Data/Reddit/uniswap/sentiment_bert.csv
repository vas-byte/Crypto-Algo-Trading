SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice TLDRAmpleforth is fascinating because it has the potential to become the global base money of the future This is done by having governance in code and it internalises any currency volatility to produce countercylical pressures with its monetary policyGet smart This is unlike the current global currency USD that we have so this model has a potential to succeedGet smarter The problem is arguably how the distribution of tokens are with certain key stakeholders Could affect token holders in the longrun General Conclusion Ampleforth is very interesting because it could definitely become a global base currency moving forward Instead of USD imagine a currency that is used by everyone in the world to trade Instead of having the world currency USD being tied to the internal politics of US this new currency is neutral and changes its monetary supply based on the global demand of moneyIn this episode we will uncover the design of Ampleforth works the economic considerations and how it plays a role in the DeFi space 1 What is Ampleforth AMPL Ampleforth wants to be a token with a stable value How They do this with an automated governance using code by internalising the price volatility in the secondary market Explain more The code is 2 math functions 1 It calculates the price difference between the ideal price USD1 and the actual exchange rate now eg US115 Then it mints more tokens so that the price goes back down to US1 2 It doesnt do this suddenly token changes happen over a period of 10 days We call this supply smoothing So whats cool about it It can be used as collaterals in the DeFi projects Its also not strictly pegged to a fiat currency eg DAI with USD so it makes it more independent and useful in the long run Basically Ampleforth is the new global currency without central bank Can I earn money with AMPL It is possible For example doing arbitrage trading with price differences because you know that prices will always go back to US1 2 AMPL vs AAVE COMP USD You cant compare AMPL with AAVE or COMP because they have different token functions AMPL has a money function and AAVE or COMP has a utility function Its like comparing USD with American Airlines miles system Its similar but not the same But you can compare AMPL with USD because they both have money functions AMPL has an independent monetary policy while USD clearly does not USD is governed by the central bank aka FED Its a bunch of smart people in a room deciding how much money should be available in the economy the interest rates the lending rates etc AMPL is governed by code instead Is that good or bad It really depends Its good because economists are always looking for solutions to get an independent neutral money used by everyone We call this the Triffin Dilemma However because it is only governed by code its possible to affect the secondary market in a short period if you have enough tokens to manipulate the code 3 Economics Design of Ampleforth Market Design To increase network effects and demand for AMPL there are 2 systems in place increase the use of AMPL as collaterals for DeFi projects use of Geyser program for people to stake their tokens To reduce insane fluctuation in prices a supply smoothing function is applied so the change in token quantity is done over a period of 10 days To become more politically independent and to tap onto the benefits of a digital network the information prices volatility decision making is done by oracles and machines Mechanism Design Math is used to define the rules of the game for the system to abide by When prices change it affects the amount of tokens available This directly affects the number of tokens you have in your wallet Get smart this is where most people dont understand the system They think that AMPL is a scam Because tokens can be See below 5 Valuation of Ampleforth for further explanation Oracles are used to take in prices via exchange rates of AMPL and internalise that information How It changes the amount of of AMPL supply in response to the prices If prices are too high print more AMPL If prices are too low burn some AMPL Token Design Instead of chartallist money like USD AMPL is metallist money aka commodity money like gold But we call it synthetic or digital metallist money Machines math mentioned in 3 define the monetary policy Uses Countercyclical approach see points above on when it prints or burns AMPL Reduce economic fluctuations see mechanism design above on internalising price differences and changing supply so value of 1 AMPL is about US1 AMPLs value is allowed to fluctuate between 5 of US1 this US1 is pegged to the economic definition of Consumer Price Index CPI for the 2019 dollar Supply smooth is used so that we prevent supply side inflation or shocks So if there is an increase in tokens by 15 the increase will happen over 10 days Each day will increase by 15 instead Its also interesting because it has low correlation to Cryptoassets price fluctuations Get smart this is great for being part of the portfolio Big VCs own a significant percentage of AMPL tokens that is vest Get smart this can be dangerous when the vesting period is over and they dump it in the market 4 Monetary Policy There are 3 situations in the monetary policy Graphs and explanations are in the video expansionary Prices will remain the same in the longrun But supply will increase Market cap will increase in the longrun contractionary Prices will remain the same in the longrun But supply will decrease Market cap will decrease in the longrun Combine all these 3 states together so you can visualise what the general shape of the supply and price and market cap looks like,Bullish,0.5544319748878479

our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice TLDR That is about Sifchain which will probably start the scheduled launch in midJanuary This system is quite interesting it adds a new dimension to a new layer to such systems One of the problems with all these different systems built on Ethereum Blockchain where transactions get very expensive We have other solutions like Thorchain that is built on layer 1 but they do not exactly interact with ERC20 tokens So Sifchain resolves that by having both Validators and Liquidity Providers on their system It is a layer 2 solution with their own Dapp We also have layer 2 solutions but most of them have fixed parameters which makes Sifchain different as they can rebalance the parameters depending on the conditions of the system Let us keep an eye on whether Sifchain becomes a welcome solutionGet smart Sifchain is ahead of the curve when it comes to application specific blockchains to reduce reliance on ETH network and to reduce transaction costsGet smarter Sifchain is coming out next week Check out to follow their plans General Conclusion In the previous episodes we have done plenty of deep dives into decentralised exchanges For example Uniswap using XYK Bancor uses a more complex model that arrives at a similar result and Balancer uses a formula with more variables Today we will be sharing another DEX Sifchain The main difference is that it is built on their own blockchain This adds some complexity to the usual AMM incentive and reward structure And thats what we are going to cover Crosschain AMM vs usual AMM AMMIn DEXs were always talking about a typical AMM That is built on a specific layer one and you dont have to think about how to deal with validators to validate these transactions Because that is done by someone else as its a different protocol a different set of people a different company different project different opensource smart contractTypical AMM Built on Ethereum like UniswapIn typical AMMs theyre just building a platform to transit between the cryptoassets so for example on Uniswap you can transact between ETH and wNXM or wBTC There are all these different assets available which are ERC20 that you could trade and swapCross Chain 1 Built on Ethereum like BancorThen we have this another type which is different because its similar to Uniswap and it allows you to trade between assets and expands a little bit further You can also trade ERC20 assets and crypto assets on EOS or in TronThink of each layer one as a country In Ethereum everything is built in the US Only US stocks are being traded over there Bancor is where you can trade stocks that are from the UK so you live in the states and you can trade with UK stocksCross Chain 2 Built on its own Layer 1 like SifchainLastly application specific blockchain also allows for crosschain exchanges It adds in a layer one component so it has its own layer one solution where it will validate each of these transactions as wellThere are a lot of pros and cons to that Pros generally being that its probably a lot faster a lot cheaper and you can control a bit more of the different behaviors and different incentives to affect a different kind of behaviors that you want to have in your ecosystem Because you can control or you can incentivise actions in the validators layer and the liquidity provider layer so the application layer The cons is that because you have two focuses now its important to balance them Sifchain big picture overview Sifchain vs Bitcoin I want to show you when comparing Sifchain and Bitcoin because they have the similar idea Blockchain consists of blocks and they are connected in chains Bitcoin Each block we need to verify transactions which will record transaction information between the two parties Each verified block will be put into the chain This is verification that existsWhere is Bitcoin createdBitcoin is generated from each new block which is verified But the winning validators will get these new Bitcoins And step by step more Bitcoins is brought into the network These are what we call layer 1What happens on top layer 1What is built on layer 2 are decentralised applications Dapps If you send me your 1 Bitcoin it happens on the application layer and all of this transaction information is confirmed and put into the next block on layer 1 Sifchain Sifchain as you can imagine is also quite similar it has layer one solution and it has a little box to be validated so if we go back to layer one again you have block one block two block three that will be validated so block one is when you have all these different transactions and then you also have validators that will be getting your tokens and their token is called ROWAN so they will also be getting these tokens which are basically block rewards and the key difference is that in bitcoin your block reward is fixed and it only changes every four years but here the block rewards changes every single time a transaction occurs because it is dynamically increasing and its dynamically calculated so the block rewards for every block thats minted by validators changes and so layer one is the validators which is same as bitcoin The main difference Bitcoin has a fixed reward and a decreasing half every 4 yearsROWAN validators get paid every second when transactions occur dynamically So block reward from ROWAN will change and not be fixedFurthermore the applications on Bitcoins layer 1 are P2P transactions such as BTC transactions from person to person In dapp layer for ROWAN transactions or swaps are executed with ROWAN pair and Validators will receive ROWAN rewards So these are the basic ideas that differ between them,Bullish,0.5627642869949341

articles on our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice TLDR DOGE is a cryptocurrency that was created by a joke but has an amazing growth as it is in the top 10 of the largest cryptocurrencies by capitalisation When looking at the design aspects DOGE is basically similar to Bitcoin but without a fixed supply and has the same amount of DOGE mined each year 5 billion DOGE In terms of mining it is different from Bitcoin as the number of Bitcoin mining is halved every 4 years Financial incentive when you become a miner you join the network maintain it and get a reward of DOGE Despite having a very simple mechanism the community of Dogecoin is very large and loyal Thats why this Cryptocurrency still exists General Conclusion In the past time we have witnessed tremendous growth from Dogecoin Especially this growth comes from Elon Musk when he constantly memes about this coin It is clear that even though Dogecoin is only created just for fun this coin has reached a market cap of over US60 million a few days ago In todays article lets dive into Dogecoin based on the analysis of the economic mechanism we often use Spoiler alert this might not be the coin you want to put your money in At least we do not Note This article is not meant to be offensive we respect the development of any coin in the space Lets go What Is Dogecoin A meme coin A crypto currency Built using the Bitcoin infrastructure but not related to Bitcoin prices Dogecoin DOGE is an opensource p2p cryptocurrency It can easily be sent through the internet from person to person with security You can send Dogecoin anywhere in a second faster and cheaper than Bitcoin One of the important points for Dogecoin is that it is already accepted at online retailers Dogecoin can be used in payment buy items at gamestop trade and so much more DOGE In Real Life What is make Dogecoin truly unique from other currencies Dogecoins ease of use makes it the perfect way to instantly send cash gifts to people all around the world You can send 10 cents to your favourite comment on Twitter or 10 to your favourite band to purchase their latest album you can even send 100 to a charity that you support If you are a creator your fans can financially empower you for the first time You can directly receive cash from them rather than a valueless like on Facebook or retweet on Twitter This allows you to focus on creating content instead of thinking about counting cents How Did DOGE Start Dogecoin was created on December 6 2013 by a pair of software engineers as a joke Billy Markus an IBM programmer from Portland Oregon created his cryptocurrency from bitcoin source and at the time attracted a small pool of miners Since Markus wanted his cryptocurrency to be public he sought help from Jackson Palmer who works for Adobe ADBE Palmer purchased the domain dogecoin com a formation for the doge meme that was popular on the internet at the time The site originated as a joke the image of the Shiba Inu dog representing DOGE was the first image and was surrounded by a series of broken English Comic Sans text On dogecoin its mascot is captioned Dogecoin is an opensource peertopeer digital currency favoured by Shiba Inus worldwide The Economics of DOGE The same with other cryptocurrencies DOGE is a digital currency that can be bought and sold like an investment and spent like money While each cryptocurrency is unique they share some similarities with its more wellknown peers since they are all forks of Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash But they have a few key differences Unlike bitcoin which has only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined dogecoin has 129 billion coins in circulation and will continue to make new blocks of coins available for mining each year Thats part of the reason why a dogecoin is currently valued at around 045 and a bitcoin is valued at around 40000 Market Design While cryptocurrency is gaining more acceptance as a currency for buying goods dogecoin is not being used much in the real world It has several niche markets including using dogecoin to make money for online artists And the main difference is from the active online community of dogecoin This is what makes this coin so interesting The group which is active on Reddit has donated money in dogecoin to charitable causes and in 2014 Or the group successfully raised a grant for drivers advertising dogecoin in their cars Mechanism DesignGovernance DOGE has no administrative features The same is true for cryptocurrencies that are forked from Bitcoin The governance is baked directly into the code This is because it is a simple payment usecase unlike other DeFi protocols with more complex computation that we have been discussing thus far Structure DOGE uses the same PoW algorithm as Bitcoin Miners can own DOGE by participating in maintaining the network as DOGE Token DesignToken Policy The design of DOGE is not fixed in supply meaning it can be mined forever and its value depends on demand from users Bitcoin like many other altcoins has a hard limit on the number of cryptocurrencies they will allow Dogecoin does the opposite allowing for an everincreasing supply but in a steady absolute amount each year For example in 2040 there will be no more Bitcoins that can be mined Therefore this will encourage hoarding of the Bitcoin supply This will push up Bitcoins price but reduce Bitcoins actual transaction volume ie reduce the available floating volume On the other hand by allowing 5 billion DOGE per year to increase the supply of Dogecoins infinitely the supply will increase but eventually reach the actual limit Thus we can calculate the inflation rate of a currency over time For example look at the chart Ive compiled below It shows that every decade the supply increases by 50 billion Dogecoins,Bullish,0.5978187918663025

100 FREE crypto articles on our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice TLDR If behavioural economics is the first principle in economics design then supply and demand is the second basic principle There are many ways to design and govern supply and demand The design is dependent on the purpose and objective of the token This episode is going to be real simple and basic I dont want to assume that everyone knows everything There are plenty of things that I dont know Its always best to go back to basics The future episodes will be more technical and nerdy so lets get the basic foundations right before we build complicated structures How is behavioural economics and supply and demand the basic principles It is all about economic engineering In economics design instead of using models to describe how the world works we design the rules that are implemented in the ecosystem So we get to design and define the supply and demand Topics covered this week 1 The basics of supply and demand 2 How to govern supply and demand 3 How to apply supply and demand in token economics At the end of the day we are designing economics systems via rules and mechanisms As a designer you have a set objectives that you want the ecosystem to achieve The challenge here is how to implement the objectives We have behavioural economics to push people towards that shared objective And we have supply and demand to affect their actions too Think of it as a twoprong approach rules for the irrational mind and rules for the rational mind Supply Demand 101 In economics we always talk about supply and demand They are 2 lines And usually when they intersect that is what we call market equilibrium That point where the 2 lines meet is the market price and market quantity But what these lines share is the relationship between both parties When prices are low buyers will demand more When prices are high buyers will demand less It is the opposite for sellers When prices are high sellers want to sell more When prices are low sellers want to sell less The buyers line shows at what price how much the buyer wants to buy The sellers line shows at what price how much the seller wants to sell When the lines meet it is the specific price where both buyers and sellers are comfortable with buying and selling at For example when you travel to Southeast Asia and bargain for an item That is the price both buyers and sellers are willing to trade and exchange the item for money There are a few things that affect the buyers line and sellers line Buyers Line We also call this a demand curve The demand curve is different for each person In the big picture we combine all the individual demand curves together to get the demand curve of the entire ecosystem These are factors that affect how much the buyer wants to buy at a specific price The number of available substitutes consumer preferences and the shifts in the price of complementary products affect demand For example if the price of video game consoles drops the demand for games for that console may increase as more people buy the console and want games for it Sellers Line We call this a supply curve Similarly when we have plenty of sellers we combine all the various curves together and get the supply curve of the entire ecosystem These factors are production capacity production costs such as labor and materials and the number of competitors directly affect how much supply businesses can create With supply curve there are other indirect factors know as ancillary factors These are material availability weather and the reliability of supply chains also can affect supply Governance How and Why Why do we need to govern supply and demand Because it affects our logical decision making actions We can govern them in various ways and methods Supply There are different types of supply curve Fixed supply to limit the supply on the resources because it is like that land reduce governance intermediaries central bank Diminishing supply things that are used up and nonreplaceable or takes a long time diamond minerals These are hard to attain as they disappear and takes a very long time to create Fluctuating supply depends on something arbitrary and cant be controlled eg gas or solar energy Diminishing increase in supply total supply increases with time but it increases less each period For example oil extraction via OPEC andor other related countries It is the slow increase in supply until there is none left Demand The demand for a particular product would be different in different situations We must be clear about the type of demand to create valueadd usecases to boost the demand Effective demand classical demand curve that shows the willingness of someone to pay The lower the price the more the willingness to pay Latent potential demand demand that is not yet expressed in the marketplace Derived demand proxy demand where something in demand shows the similar demand pattern For example increase in IoT increases the demand for cloud servers Composite demand goods with more than 1 use like basic fundamental product Think of butter garlic and onion for chefs Most recipes require them Joint demand a product is positively related to another They are complements Like fish and chips Competitive demand products that are close substitutes of each other Application to Token Economics Now lets apply supply and demand to token economics Supply Fixed supply these are fixed supply by design or the supply is fixed in the shortterm That means supply can change in the longterm but it takes a longer time Example tokens relating to property in real life limited just because or in a game limited by design Diminishing supply depending on the tokens purpose diminishing supply can be useful for certain tokens Exchange tokens are a fan of this mechanism eg the hyperdeflationary token of BNB Fluctuating supply supply changes algorithmically depending on the inputs A classical example is seigniorage shares in the crypto space Diminishing increase in supply you are most familiar with this That is the example of Bitcoin where supply increases daily but halves every 4 years Things for you to consider when deciding supply schedule Do you need governance to control supply of tokens What is the purpose of token and why does it exist Pegged token or synthetic tokens or complicated tokens What behaviours do you want to encourage via your tokens Demand Effective demand you can see the charts on 1718 March 2020 where people purchased more Bitcoins when prices fell In general this is most evident in secondary trading markets Latent potential demand the best way to see this is through crowdfunding and presale of a project Derived demand as more Dapps are built on ethereum transactions will require gas and the more transactions on Dapps the more expensive the fees are Composite demand protocol layer tokens focusing on interoperability increases the demand of tokens as it gets more interoperable Joint demand for DeFi products like cryptoETF and pieDAO the increase in demand affects the demand of the individual goods Competitive demand BTC and BCH are similar yet different Conclusion This episode covers the basic fundamentals of supply and demand and how it relates to tokens Sometimes it is so basic that it goes over our head This episode just brings us back to the fundamentals when things get more complicated Fundamentals are good because they rarely change And so we can build funky models on the fundamentals,Neutral,0.5910918116569519

articles on our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice When we discuss risks in crypto we look at both risks from the perspective of token owners and risks from the protocol By knowing their major sources of risk exposures we can have a better picture of what the protocol will possibly be like in the long term and a more thorough understanding of the whole crypto space In this article we will walk through a general framework and additional points to consider for financial risk analysis of stablecoins General classification of risk Before moving on to financial risk in details lets recap on the general classification of risk that we are using Under our analytical framework risk is either systematic or idiosyncratic Systematic risk are the ones that affect the whole market and cannot be well controlled by the protocol itself This includes the market risk like price variations failure of underlying blockchain layer and irregular user behaviour Meanwhile Idiosyncratic risk are the ones that are relevant to token and mechanism design which can be controlled by the protocol to some extent and only directly affects the particular protocol itself Fig 1 General risk classification Under our definition financial risk is a type of idiosyncratic risk It describes the risk of losing money in operation which is predominantly determined by how the token is designed under the protocol Financial risk for stablecoins comes from two main areas cashflow and collaterals Financial risk from cashflow When conducting risk analysis cashflow is often one of the most direct and easily analyzable sources of risk Changes in cashflow for the protocol over time gives information on how well the protocol is operating and also its ability of pulling through a crisis Meanwhile cross comparison of cashflow figures and growth with other protocols can show which tokens in the market are in better financial standing and hence likely to be more sustainable In the long term protocols with healthier cashflow conditions are more likely to gain investor confidence and attract more people in buying the tokens This is extremely important for stablecoins as their values are pegged to a previously specified amount with very minimal variation in monetary values Investors make decisions to buy stablecoins based on how they plan to utilize the token and also whether the token is reliable in the future The most common way to analyze financial risk from cashflow is to break down the incoming and outgoing cash over fixed time intervals and compare their growth Depending on how the protocol is designed income and expense can be further classified into subcategories based on where they come from such as interest trading and operating Significant changes in the proportions of each category may indicate structural changes in the protocols financial performance Advancing to a higher level of analysis we can look at the key ratios calculated from cashflow data These key ratios are created based on the data available for each protocol to compare income and expense data with the important token metrics such as price transaction volume and market capitalization Some of the possible key ratios that can be considered but not limited to are the following Percentage of each subcategory of income and expense Ratio of cash inflow to outflow Protocol net income to market capitalization Protocol revenue income to market capitalization Changes in these ratios give information on how the protocol has been growing over time which helps us to identify the stage of development and expected amount of variations in finance performance to better gauge their level of risk exposures Given the complexity of token data and the fact that most protocols have only been created in the very recent years we are still unable to form a clear cutoff for these ratios to distinguish between the different levels of risk Nonetheless these ratios can be used for comparison across time and market Also we will expect newer projects to have less stable financials so the seemingly negative ratios in the early stage may not lead to the conclusion that protocol is facing high financial risk But for projects that have existed for years with a stable pool of users significant variations of key ratios may hint there could be changes in operation that changed the token holders decisions and unhealthy cashflow Financial risk from collaterals Another significant source of financial risk of stablecoins comes from the collaterals In the token market today stablecoins maintain stability of value through collaterals or algorithmic mechanisms that balances the reserved assets The types of collaterals used directly impacts buying decisions of the stablecoin hence play an important role in determining the financial risk exposures To analyze such risk we will first look at how the stablecoin maintains its value whether the reserve is made up of onchain assets other tokens offchain assets cash and cash equivalents a combination of the two or through algorithms with no reserve or partial reserve 1 Onchain collateral For stablecoins collateralized with onchain assets such as DAI and LUSD the degree of transparency is often the highest as collateral data can be queried We can study the composition of collaterals including what are the assets making up the collateral pool collaterization ratio of each type of asset and if there had been any significant changes in the structure of collateral pool in the past For a stablecoin to be considered as having low financial risk exposure the collateral pool should be relatively stable with no significant flux in proportion of each asset type The collateralization ratio should also be set to a reasonable range such that the value of collateral reserve can still sustain if there is a sudden decrease in collateralized asset prices but also not to an overly high level that discourages investors from holding the token 2 Offchain collateral For stablecoins collateralized with offchain assets such as cash commercial paper fiduciary deposits secured loans short term treasury bills corporate bonds and other investments For these tokens financial risk exposure is lower when the proportion of cash is higher as a reserve pool will have better ability to deal with unexpected situations that require high liquidity of assets On the other end tokens backed with assets that cannot be readily converted to cash may not stabilize to its pegged value when there is a sudden drop in collateral value An important point to note here is that some protocols do not give a clear breakdown on the components of their fiat reserve Instead of disclosing the proportion of cash they report the proportion of cash and cash equivalents together to make the numbers more appealing to investors Such lack of transparency will also lead to doubts and inconfidence thereby increasing financial risk exposure 3 Noncollateralized Lastly there is also a group of stablecoins that uses supplychanging algorithms to maintain its token price to a pegged value Some of these tokens are partially backed by onchain and offchain reserves while others are uncollateralized For these algorithmic coins we need to make specific analysis according to their structure of collateral If they are completely unbacked we can instead focus on the financial cashflow and ability of these tokens to maintain at a stable price Financial risk from token performance In addition to factors arising from token design and mechanism tokens performance is also a critical factor of financial risk These include the ability of the stablecoin pegging to a specific monetary value market dominance and applied uses that directly affect tokens transaction activities and income Low price volatility indicates that the token is wellbacked by collaterals or supply is under control by algorithms hence has better ability to store and maintain monetary value This will attract more people to hold the stablecoin and more platforms to utilise it We can also consider indicators like market dominance and overall ranking of the stablecoin in the whole token market Tokens with better rankings are likely to have more investors and transaction volume which bring a stable income stream and enhances the protocols resilience against financial risk Conclusion Just like the case for many other financial assets risk analysis for stablecoins is a complex process with no clear distinctions or standards and we may face many difficulties in deducing the level of risk present But going from the main sources of risk from financial performance collaterals and token performance we can get a general picture of the financial risk exposures of a protocol Due to the difference in design and mechanism of the various protocols a thorough risk analysis needs to cover multiple aspects and may require analysts to create new metrics specifically applicable to the protocol Some additional points to consider here include the time frame of data used as financial risk is a long term concept that is hard to predict if there are unexpected changes in token design after governance voting or new regulation being implemented Some metrics may also have doublesided impact on financial risk For example overcollateralization gives a stable cash reserve to sustain through a financial shock but also leads to large amounts of funds unused which may hinder tokens scalability in the long term Thus we need to be aware of these limitations understand the interactions between different types of risks and make careful judgements when determining the level of risk exposures,Bullish,0.7236558794975281

articles on our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice TLDR Ultimately tokenising the publication of the book is a new idea and also an interesting approach This can extend to any right to use services or other resources such as libraries to access certain features or to represent something NFT tokens can all achieve these goals easily and they are quite new to be fully applied and known by many people In the future we believe the above will become the same as the way social media and ecommerce change users today General Conclusion What we can build within NFT is amazing because one of the pillars in the economic design framework is mechanism design With mechanism design we can build different kinds of mechanisms to allow more efficient allocation or investment in any particular resource It can be more than just art or graphic design What if we can tokenise property rights and instead of signing a thick legal contract you just sign on your smart contract with an embedded mechanism design When you are selling and distributing these tokens there is a lot of economics and science behind them and that is what we want to talk about today I also want to share the experiment that I am working on which is tokenising distribution rights and publishing rights of a book my book as an NFT Problems with Traditional Publishing How I got started with this idea of tokenising publishing rights as an NFT is that I published a book and it took me two years of failures to finally release it The first two years were difficult because nobody really wanted to publish the book I went to a lot of publishing houses and spoke to a lot of editors but they found this to be very niche and risky for them and they did not want to invest In property rights longterm investment and allocation efficiency are the two tradeoffs In the investment area a publishing house does not want to invest in a niche book because they do not know if there is demand for it which is completely understandable In addition the bigger the publishing house the more riskaverse they will be Allocation Allocation efficiency means that the book needs to be allocated to the right kind of people who are actually interested in this field Selfpublishing is an efficient allocation because you are publishing and distributing it to the right people in your network How the system works In general the token will represent the distribution rights for this specific book and the price of this distribution right will increase as more people come in to distribute it The pricing model here is a way to express the risk aversion of the person distributing the book When you are buying the distribution right or the NFT to be able to distribute the book during the early stages it will be a lot cheaper because you are taking on more risk I want to compensate you for taking on more risk by making it cheaper for you As you go up the ladder you realise more and more people know about the book and more people are asking for it in different jurisdictions Now there is an incentive for another person to come in to buy the distribution rights and distribute the book within their jurisdiction In this scenario there is less risk because there has already been promotion advertising and awareness of the book around the space so you have to compensate for that by paying a higher price to buy the distribution and publishing rights There is a very simple bonding curve to measure how the system works In the smart contract you can embed things like expiration limits to the number of books and all those kind of funky things The Need for Tokenisation Tokenisation exists because it is a very powerful way to do internal calculations or accounting When Bitcoin started it was a way to create this global accounting system to correlate the buyside and the demand on the sellside This is the same for physical books there are distribution rights and agents will sell the books within their jurisdiction Every time you sell the book you are promoting it in a lot of different ways Some people do not want to buy the physical book and just want the ebook Ebooks are quite hard to calculate because someone living in Thailand might look at the book that is promoted in New Zealand but buy the book for a friend in San Francisco In this case it crosses many jurisdictions and compensating that advertising to the right kind of people is important This is where tokens come in and the proportion of physical books sold can be used to calculate how much of the profits generated by the ebooks will be added to these distributors so it becomes a new revenue stream for the distributors Reselling Licensing The paper that Professor Anthony Lee Zhang wrote talks about depreciating licenses where after a certain time a part of the license is resold to the market and you have to purchase it back to continue using it If you dont want to use it anymore then you can resell it to someone else Everything can be done using the second price auction method which is the mechanism that was awarded the Nobel Prize last year It is an evolution of this new area of mechanism and market design that is currently flourishing in the economic space There are a lot of ways that we can play around with this in the traditional world but I want to take these concepts and apply them in crypto because the testing time or experimentation term is a lot faster It is a lot better for us to test these kinds of economic theses As economists we love creating and building beautiful models with a lot of assumptions that everyone is rational Sometimes reality is not like that and the best way to test these theories is through actual experimentation If these experiments could be in radio spectrum or 5G spectrum allocation that would be great but it is a bit too risky at this stage for government to come and experiment around in this space We can start experimenting on a smaller scale like the licensing of book distribution so that we can figure out if there is allocation and investment efficiency and start scaling up from there to a lot of different areas We can do this for other licensing mechanisms and in something like layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain validator allocation especially when we are moving to the proof of stake system,Bullish,0.5302581787109375

articles on our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice TLDR These interesting terms are used often in the crypto and DeFi space I hope these explanation is easy for you to understand If you have more terms youd like a human explanation on please comment in this newsletter or email them via replying to this newsletter General Classification You hear these terms often These are general blockchain terms You are a retail cryptotrader does not affect you that much You are a developer affects you depending on what are you building You are a regulator affects you depending on what you want to regulate 1 Layer 1 Layer 1 is just the base layer If you imagine theres blockchain has different a kind of blocks this is basic layer 1 as in a tech stack and then on top you could have another kind of systems processes and technological stack Crypto Examples Bitcoin Ethereum and Polkadot These are different kinds of layer 1 solutions and you could build things on top of them Tech world examples IMAP protocol to send your email from gmail com to yahoo com Why is the distinction important The economics involved in layer one is very different from the economics of layer 2 and the other kind of layers 2 Layer 2 If layer 1 is the base layer layer 2 is something thats being built upon it Layer 2 is usually the scalable solutions and that helps transactions faster Layer 1 is good The objective is to send data in a distributed way and to make sure the other attacks dont happen Thats security And usually it means to sacrifice scalability Layer 2 solves this Crypto Examples Lightning network Plasma chain and zkRollups Tech world examples 5G vs 2G Why is layer 2 important It helps with mainstream adoption for other digital products and services that need speed 3 Dapp Dapps are decentralised applications They can be related to finance DeFi esports usually NFT art also NFT They are built on top of Layer 1 or Layer 2 These are applications that you can use Crypto Examples Yearn Nexus Mutual and Axie Infinity Tech world examples iOSAndriod is Layer 1 Instagram app app and web broswer are Dapp Why is Dapp important You can hold ETH or BTC or DOT Theres nothing much you can do with it Dapps are applications where you can have more usecases with your tokens DeFi General Terms Another set of terms you hear often These are general finance terms specific to crypto You are a retail cryptotrader affects you Basically your bread and butter You are a developer affects you depending on what are you building You are a regulator affects you depending on what you want to regulate 4 DeFi DeFi decentralised finance DeFi looks to reduce intermediaries in the financial space by decentralising the operations That is different from the capital market aka traditional centralised finance Sometimes that is known as TradFi or CeFi What will be decentralised The entire governance mechanism and technology layer will be completely decentralised And the beginning for DeFi was Bitcoin a peertopeer currency Now the cryptocurrency space has grown a bit more We have lending platforms dexchanges derivatives insurance and the aggregators So decentralised finance has developed a lot of things beyond just p2p lending and Bitcoin DeFi Examples P2P currency and technology to remove doublespending CeFi examples Currency issued by the central bank Why is DeFi important It opens up financial access to everyone without intermediaries 5 Money Lego Go back to being a child You are playing with Lego You can stack them up and create different types of Lego structure Now you are an adult You play with a different type of Lego Its money Lego That means the various technological pieces as lego bricks to build new financial product or infrastructure More specifically it is to combine various products lending exchange options insurance and connect them to other products For Example we have ETH and want to tradehedge So that we can mortgage ETH on Compound to receive DAI and transfer DAI to a pool on Uniswap to buy more ETH Or we can go to derivatives platform and hedge our positions This is Money Lego that you can stack many types of protocols DeFi Examples Collateralise ETH on Compound to borrow DAI lending and exchange it for Cream exchange and use Cream to stake in various liquidity pools to get an annualised return CeFi world examples A similar example is Repo Why is Money Lego important This allows for each protocol to specialise in a specific financial instrument and allow anyone to use them as a tool to create new products 6 Composability Composability is a systems design principle A protocol can be broken down by different functions and its functions can be used for other purposes Compostability is very similar to Money Lego Different protocols are created with specific purposes but you can use their functions to achieve your goals For example you can combine the loan functionality of Compound exchange from Uniswap and provide liquidity on Sushiswap to create a decentralised derivative exchange with one click Instead of building everything from scratch Thats the general idea of DeFi which is evolving very quickly,Bullish,0.6038504838943481

provide over 100 FREE crypto articles on our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice TLDRFrax the project has a different approach than all other algorithmic stablecoins with a model of 2 tokens that complement each other When FRAX becomes stable the supply of FXS decreases and when FRAX decreases in value the supply of FXS increases General Conclusion FRAX is the first fractional algorithmic stablecoin protocol with the goal of providing a highly scalable and decentralised cryptocurrency In the FRAX protocol there are two active tokens FRAX stablecoin and FXS FRAX shares Classifying Stablecoins There are four main categories 1 Mechanism 2 Peg 3 Collateral Amount 4 Collateral Type FRAX uses three mechanisms dual token reservebased mechanism and algorithmic mechanism It is softpegged to the US dollar FRAX is partially collateralised so it has 100 or fewer assets or reserve backing the value of the token It uses onchain assets and there are two main assets in place 1 The stablecoin so USDC and USDT which is the collateral amount itself 2 Collateralised by the secondary token which is the FRAX Share Token FXS Dual Token This means that there are two tokens in the system FRAX and FXSFRAX It is softpegged to the US dollar and is not very volatile It maintains the peg which is the desired outcomeFXS This token captures the value that is within the ecosystem as well as being a governance token Three types of value can be accrued by the FXS 1 Value creation from seigniorage shares of the Frax 2 The fees collected by the ecosystem 3 Any excess collateral amount of value that is being accrued Reserves FRAX is also backed by reserves and is under collateralised If it is 20 backed by USDC for example then the other 80 needs to be FSX FRAX is backed 100 by assets and a part of it is USDC which is acknowledged by everyone and can be traded anywhere FSX is an asset created within the ecosystem and is more valued in the ecosystem than outside Reserve Backed Asset Classification FRAX can be used to redeem the underlying collateral which means every FRAX that you mint or burn is linked to some amount of USDC and some amount of FRAX FRAX FRAX is also an algorithmic stablecoin that is stabilised via mortgaging of assets and burning FXS Currently the assets used as collateral to create FRAX only have stablecoins such as USDC and USDT before in due course allowing collateral with other assets FRAX is mintedredeemed to peg at 1 The total value of FRAX minted is guaranteed to be equal to the sum of the value of FXS the number of FXS to be burned When FRAX is redeemed the user will get back the collateral and FXS at the same value amount of FXS minted For example USDCs collateral rate is 99 so to generate 1 worth of FRAX requires 099 worth of USDC and 01 worth of FXS Or at a collateral rate of 98 to redeem 1 FRAX the user will receive 098 in USDC and 02 in FXSDetails of the formula for calculating the amount of mintingredeem FRAX you can find here Minting FRAX This is a fourstep process 1 Determine how much USDC you have Eg 100 USDC 2 You want to figure out what is the collateral C ratio that the system has and the C ratio is protocol wide Let us say it is 75 which means that 75 in collateral is USDC or USDT and 25 is FXS 3 Find out how much FXS is needed Lets say FRAX is 26 1 100 USDC 25 1 collateral ratio or 75 26 FXS 75 FXS 1282 1 Calculate how much FRAX is going to be minted FRAX Minted collateral value FXS value FRAX 100USDC 1 1282FXS26 13333 FRAX Maintaining Stability Arbitrage One of the main things in any stablecoin ecosystem is that the ecosystem itself will always recognise the stablecoin as 1 dollar which is very important because this is how arbitrage happens Arbitrage is when the same asset has two different values in different places You can buy from a place where it is cheaper and sell it at a place where it is more expensive 1 When it is more than 1 dollar then users will want to mint FRAX and sell it in the secondary market 1 When it is less than 1 dollar people will buy from the secondary market and sell it in the primary market Selling means burning and redeeming it for the underlying collateral This helps to balance the system back to 1 dollar because supply is reduced which helps to bring the prices up CRatio Update The other important thing is the C ratio update FRAX itself wants to update the C ratio quite dynamically The C ratio as mentioned is a systemwide matrixlike Alchemix but it allows you to change which is similar to Maker because they have a different kind of C ratio within the system PID Controller The C ratio is maintained using the PID controller which is something that was updated in Q1 of this year It updates the C ratio based on the growth rate which is a relative matrix to understand the price of FRAX as well as the circulating supply of FXS When the price of FRAX increases or decreases it affects the total supply of FRAX shares availableWhen it is more than 1 dollar people mint more FRAX and when it is less than 1 dollar people will burn and redeem it for the underlying FXS This increases or decreases the supply and affects the prices There is a relationship between the FXS and the FRAX which is important in maintaining the stability of the systemThey calculate a simple ratio to understand the relationship between the circulating supply of FXS as well as the total supply of FRAX available Using this ratio they will update the collateral amount or the collateral ratio by the entire system Its like a small controller where you can change the knobs of the entire system You can increase or decrease the C ratio based on the relationship of FRAX versus the FXS,Neutral,0.5390487909317017

crypto articles on our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice TLDR What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves Education offchain integration as well as governance are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this renaissance truly impactful It is not just protesting on the streets or arguing with people on Twitter These are tangible things that we can do right now to make a very big significant difference in the future What Has History Taught Us One way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation Throughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasnt just religious and they actually acted as a political entity The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy During the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didnt have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time the printing press and doubleentry bookkeeping ie a ledger Ledger Ledger was absolutely radical at that point in time Credit and debit and left and right was something new Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities It was like magic where all of a sudden the power brokers didnt have absolute control over the monetary system You could essentially prevent false forks increase velocity and composability As a result there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledgerbased accounting and reconciliation system for contracts It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole protocapitalistic or protoeconomic class Printing Press When we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines They were almost like the memes of the day It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a years or 10years salary to have a scribe make the copy It was locked away under permission and observability Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree The technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop offgrid They tried to KYC it and register printers which didnt work either They were placed in this nowin situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market Only like five percent of people were literate at that time You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a years salary or 10years salary to being the cost of a chicken essentially Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access How Can Tokens Coordinate Market Creation Society is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact which is coordination The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring which is a tool for incentivisation People only do things because they are incentivised to do so Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination In the previous world you had to trade through centralised aggregation There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high They were allowed granted permission and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a persons connection with someone else What happened with the advent of ledgerbased accounting was that it broke those markets apart so basically decentralisation happened Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of doubleentry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small We can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time at our pace and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically and that has massive benefits to markets Crypto Success How Can Everyone Get Access To It What happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was havenots Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking peoples jobs Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists Education There is usually an adoption curve and the first piece is education We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation Adoption Part of cryptos success will be in its adoption and by that I mean does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power realworld businesses We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five six or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it Current State Right now DeFi is awesome but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it But if I can actually have onchain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow The Future The future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life and then there is a broader circle still about education The interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre From that perspective crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is is there going to be a reemergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and realworld intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen Value Creation Value creation has shifted from the religion of money is everything to as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value then you are valuable This is the new worlds UBI UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps If we look at human productivity as a linear line then we have very unproductive people and very productive people Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be which is integration between machines and humans We are segregating this line into more segments and you have different kinds of middle layers being formed so you have small little boutiques catering to very specific subsegments of people A feature of this is that one is able to solve specific needs by this specific segment of people in this timeline Micro Token Economies As NationStates When we create these little microeconomies we are basically recreating how nationstates work the legal structure the social contracts and the legal contracts in NFTs We are talking about citizen rights onchain rights and reputation engine Imagined Communities The way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this Conclusion One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities However with technology we can level up the playing field We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system then there is no point arguing It is the best experiment ever Education offchain integration as well as governance are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this truly impactful It is not just protesting on the streets or arguing with people on Twitter These are tangible things that we can do right now to make a very big significant difference in the future,Bullish,0.5008195638656616

FREE crypto articles on our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice Introduction When designing any economy be it P2E or nonblockchain based it is important to first consider the types of economic agents in the space These economic agents can be split into 5 personas players builders developers investors and NFT collectors We see these agents in traditional nonblockchain based games too although NFT collectors are the first of its kind There are investors in nonblockchain games which are also a new dimension as the investor model has shifted Because we see a new addition to the economic agents involved the economics of P2E can change drastically depending on the incentives to them For all economic agents we look at them from the perspective of the existing economics design framework Market Design Mechanism Design and Token Design The market design is the economys parameters typically defined by the game developer and by extension game designer aesthetic and economy design Mechanism design is the rules for economic participation in the games world These determine both the gameplay and rules of how these agents interact with each other Token design is the value creation when users interact in the game world The reason for having these personas is that they help to scope out the right economic policies in each unique game economy As the underlying game is different the economic policies can also differ greatly 1 Players Players are the core value creator in the game universe The way the market can be created will affect the players entering For instance a Free to Play vs Pay to Play model That can greatly affect the number of players thus the thickness of the market The development for the game is also important as players do not just take on a single role They can also take on the role of builders and the open vs closedsource development can impact how market thickness is bootstrapped Depending on the level of ideal decentralisation the players can also take on leadership and governance roles Having such a plan in the roadmap can help in the ideation of the native governance tokens monetary policy If decentralisation is the goal the interactions between agent types will be something to think about when designing the economic policies and token economics After all the token model emphasises the policies for these agents Understanding the player types help to have a better sense of the player behaviours For instance certain promotions might encourage adverse selection of bots and players as opposed to real players focusing on game play and value creation That can definitely affect the effectiveness of increasing market size of the game In the context of mechanism design traditional gameplay is of essence to players The various incentive loops pay to win and game scope enhance how fun the game is played which helps in value creation by the players Lastly in a Play to Earn model that we see in blockchain tokens play a new and important role in the economy Considerations like potential earnings in dollars inflation rates tradeoffs for late entrants and revenue share are important considerations of the player in any game 2 Builders Builders are a specific type of player in the game Whilst they are not core infrastructure developers they help to build the world which then facilitates the game world for players It is possible for one to be both a player and builder When building the game universe assets and infrastructure the builder considers the market at large Such as the demographic reach the ingame vs offgame activity whitelabel vs license model and connectivity to offgame blocks and usecases This increases the utility of infrastructure built which increases the value creation multiplier to the builder For the mechanism design this means the ability to leverage development of the main game to build new infrastructure And to do that it is important to be mindful of the rules of interaction In token design there needs to be value recognition for external parties This value is realised by holding the tokens hence it becomes a consideration when designing the monetary policy of the token 3 Developers As the core game developer the market is not just players but also potential partners and different types of players in the game This increases thickness and also increases the type of users A diversification of usertypes helps to build a more antifragile potentially countercyclical system Mechanism design will be core principles for developers That includes the resources supply regulation DAO functions to update rules of the game and the balance between having the entire games economic policy designed by the developer or to allow for new rules to be created by the community In terms of monetary policy the developer has to balance between the token monetary policy utility of various token types and most importantly the relationship among different tokens and players to help with value creation 4 Investors Investors take a different approach to market design Looking internally that is the various metrics to understand market growth to look at longterm performance Externally that is the ability to cross various metaverses and grow the network effects On the mechanism design side depending on the type of investors some play the game so they hold the player persona ingame mechanisms considerations are similarly applied For nonplayers that is the rules around collectibles economy passive value accrual and longterm sustainability of the resources and tokens in the game Token design considerations for investors are both micro in terms of using the native tokens for game expansion and addition as well as macro in terms of value capture by the token and real value realisation in the game 5 NFT Collectors NFT collector is a new persona in the gaming and metaverse space There are virtual game collectors in traditional games but trading happens in the black market which incurs a middlemen fee to the players In addition the risk of trading in the black market7 includes not receiving the assets receiving counterfeit assets and receiving illegally stolen assets that are not usable in the game As NFT is publicly traded this allows for a new paradigm of market to exist This includes visibility of NFT collection notoriety of overall project and longterm attractiveness of the NFT within the game market and external metaverse market The utility and contribution of the NFT asset in the game and its subsequent mechanism design becomes crucial to NFT collectors Beyond that the risks business rationale of the game and relationship between assert owners and governance also play an important role in the mechanism considerations for NFT collectors Lastly as with NFTs the supply and inflation nature of the asset together with the rarity and revenue generation profile become the key incentive for NFT collectors in the space All in all these are the 5 core persona types and their subsequent considerations in the economics design framework This builds the core building block for economists to design the right incentives for the game,Bullish,0.5236497521400452

SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice TLDRAmpleforth is fascinating because it has the potential to become the global base money of the future This is done by having governance in code and it internalises any currency volatility to produce countercylical pressures with its monetary policyGet smart This is unlike the current global currency USD that we have so this model has a potential to succeedGet smarter The problem is arguably how the distribution of tokens are with certain key stakeholders Could affect token holders in the longrun General Conclusion Ampleforth is very interesting because it could definitely become a global base currency moving forward Instead of USD imagine a currency that is used by everyone in the world to trade Instead of having the world currency USD being tied to the internal politics of US this new currency is neutral and changes its monetary supply based on the global demand of moneyIn this episode we will uncover the design of Ampleforth works the economic considerations and how it plays a role in the DeFi space 1 What is Ampleforth AMPL Ampleforth wants to be a token with a stable value How They do this with an automated governance using code by internalising the price volatility in the secondary market Explain more The code is 2 math functions 1 It calculates the price difference between the ideal price USD1 and the actual exchange rate now eg US115 Then it mints more tokens so that the price goes back down to US1 2 It doesnt do this suddenly token changes happen over a period of 10 days We call this supply smoothing So whats cool about it It can be used as collaterals in the DeFi projects Its also not strictly pegged to a fiat currency eg DAI with USD so it makes it more independent and useful in the long run Basically Ampleforth is the new global currency without central bank Can I earn money with AMPL It is possible For example doing arbitrage trading with price differences because you know that prices will always go back to US1 2 AMPL vs AAVE COMP USD You cant compare AMPL with AAVE or COMP because they have different token functions AMPL has a money function and AAVE or COMP has a utility function Its like comparing USD with American Airlines miles system Its similar but not the same But you can compare AMPL with USD because they both have money functions AMPL has an independent monetary policy while USD clearly does not USD is governed by the central bank aka FED Its a bunch of smart people in a room deciding how much money should be available in the economy the interest rates the lending rates etc AMPL is governed by code instead Is that good or bad It really depends Its good because economists are always looking for solutions to get an independent neutral money used by everyone We call this the Triffin Dilemma However because it is only governed by code its possible to affect the secondary market in a short period if you have enough tokens to manipulate the code 3 Economics Design of Ampleforth Market Design To increase network effects and demand for AMPL there are 2 systems in place increase the use of AMPL as collaterals for DeFi projects use of Geyser program for people to stake their tokens To reduce insane fluctuation in prices a supply smoothing function is applied so the change in token quantity is done over a period of 10 days To become more politically independent and to tap onto the benefits of a digital network the information prices volatility decision making is done by oracles and machines Mechanism Design Math is used to define the rules of the game for the system to abide by When prices change it affects the amount of tokens available This directly affects the number of tokens you have in your wallet Get smart this is where most people dont understand the system They think that AMPL is a scam Because tokens can be See below 5 Valuation of Ampleforth for further explanation Oracles are used to take in prices via exchange rates of AMPL and internalise that information How It changes the amount of of AMPL supply in response to the prices If prices are too high print more AMPL If prices are too low burn some AMPL Token Design Instead of chartallist money like USD AMPL is metallist money aka commodity money like gold But we call it synthetic or digital metallist money Machines math mentioned in 3 define the monetary policy Uses Countercyclical approach see points above on when it prints or burns AMPL Reduce economic fluctuations see mechanism design above on internalising price differences and changing supply so value of 1 AMPL is about US1 AMPLs value is allowed to fluctuate between 5 of US1 this US1 is pegged to the economic definition of Consumer Price Index CPI for the 2019 dollar Supply smooth is used so that we prevent supply side inflation or shocks So if there is an increase in tokens by 15 the increase will happen over 10 days Each day will increase by 15 instead Its also interesting because it has low correlation to Cryptoassets price fluctuations Get smart this is great for being part of the portfolio Big VCs own a significant percentage of AMPL tokens that is vest Get smart this can be dangerous when the vesting period is over and they dump it in the market 4 Monetary Policy There are 3 situations in the monetary policy Graphs and explanations are in the video expansionary Prices will remain the same in the longrun But supply will increase Market cap will increase in the longrun contractionary Prices will remain the same in the longrun But supply will decrease Market cap will decrease in the longrun Combine all these 3 states together so you can visualise what the general shape of the supply and price and market cap looks like,Bullish,0.5544319748878479

Booth We provide over 100 FREE crypto articles on our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice TLDRIn the Depreciating License Anthony and Glen come up with a simple game theory model of property ownership Basically you own a fixed percentage of the asset and the remaining percentage is auctioned or sold every time period In this way it combines both a full ownership model and a full rental modelThis is quite attractive because in allocating property rights we often experience a tradeoff between incentive investment 100 equity ownership and asset allocation allocating to the best at the time of allocating The amortization license model combines the two and balances the tradeoff General Conclusion Today we will discuss property rights from real life to NFT space with Anthony Lee Zhang He coauthored a paper with Glen Weyl on Depreciating Licenses DL We will go from existing problems with property rights in the physical world to the digital world and how the world is changing to bring more rights and fairness to everyoneIn this discussion we will refer to DL model including Privatisation Holdout and Allocation Next will be the tradeoffs of allocation for investment in the short and long term Finally we will discuss governance in DL game theory for DL model and applications in NFT Assistant Professor of Finance UChicago Booth Anthony Zhang If I could teleport back to two years ago I would tell myself to watch out for this paper It is exactly what I was looking for back then Property rights and tokenising property rights as well as finding more efficient ways to be embedded within property rights for efficient allocation is beautiful We can do that now Anthony discusses his research paper on property rights About Anthony Zhang Anthony Im Anthony Zhang an assistant professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth I mainly work in financial market intermediation and market design I analyse questions about how we can analyse financial markets figure out how efficient they are and how we can make them work better Some of the more classical markets that I study are the Banking industry Housing markets and Derivative marketsThis is an earlier paper actually which Ive recently revised We mainly were aiming this paper at analysing questions of natural resource license design but there seems to be an application in the crypto space too I think the paper predates the NFT boom When we were seeing all this NFT action going on we realised that some of the ideas here might also apply to the NFT space so this is where Im coming from Introduction to Depreciating Licenses Model The way we often motivate this is that the government has a bunch of natural resources This can be land but also things like radio spectrum oil drilling rights fishing rights etc All these things are sources of things that somebody can generate a value from like fishing building radio towers and selling 5G spectrum The government wants to decide who should get access to use these resources and they want to raise revenue from the use of these resources Privatisation has been the classic way to do this since the Chicago Free Market Revolution Property rights in land but also things like radio spectrum oil drilling rights fishing rights Generate a value like fishing building radio towers and selling 5G spectrum Privatisation Before this privatisation boom the government would take these licenses and give them to the best user This did not work so well because normally the government is constrained regarding how much information it can gain about who will be the most efficient user Hence the government decided to privatise and auction off these licenses based on the assumption that the highest bidder for a license would be the best user of the asset This started happening from the 90s onwards Holdout Privatisation works fairly well but it generates distortions One of the biggest distortions is that it generates holdouts when the government sells a spectrum license or a landuse license that allocation is often efficient at the time it first sells the license But 20 years later the same company is stuck with the license and much more efficient companies have come in and they want the license but the old company basically holds onto the license and waits to sell it at the highest price possible Allocation Pure privatisation does not work perfectly What we noticed is that there is a way to do slightly better than privatisation in terms of allocating resources efficiently Resource license design affects

SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice x200B FEI protocol had all of twitter talking last week Backed by significant VCs this new algorithmic stablecoin mechanism FEI managed to raise US1 billion worth of Ether within the first 24 hours And within 24 hours of launch the price of FEI dropped significantly as did TRIBE the governance tokenSo what went wrong How did the economics model and incentive design fail so terribly And what was the tipping point that caused this massive disaster Today we analyse the lessons to learn from FEI this new mechanism to create an algorithmic stablecoin TLDR FEI had great ideas in the pure engineering side of the mechanism design But economics is not pure systems engineering It includes human interaction which can make or break an ecosystem The human element is what separates engineering from economics Over the weekend on Sunday we had a community chat on Discord discussing stablecoins We touched on the topic of FEI protocol since it was the topic of the week It is a very interesting experiment that went south so its good to unpack what happened and learn from it About FEI Protocol Heres a quick summary of the FEI protocol because youve probably read about it a zillion times What is FEI A stablecoin pegged to 1 algorithmically That means FEIs economics is determined mathematically to get the 1 peg The economics can be supply withdrawal fee minting fee etc What is TRIBE A governance token to adjust the parameters to change the mechanisms of FEI What is so special 1 Instead of using ETH to create a token valued at 1 you sell your ETH for FEI 2 The protocol owns part of the assets as part of governance to manage that 1 peg 3 Direct incentives are used to reward and punish users in the system If FEI is below 1 and you sell it for ETH you have to pay a punishment fee and you get less than 1 worth of ETH back If you deposit ETH to mint more FEI when it is less than 1 you get more FEI in return How did it get so popular It was backed by large VCs and strong personalities on Twitter How much did it raise 13 billion in ETH of which 1 billion was raised in 24h What happened within 24h of it releasing People wanted to get their ETH back by returning FEI This caused massive sell pressure and with the value of FEI with the incentive dropped significantly At one point it was less than 040 when it is meant to be pegged at 1 This was a 60 value loss Why did people put money in in the first place Economics Mechanism of FEI Protocol So lets dive into the economics mechanism analysis We will never stray too far from economics fundamentals supply demand willingness to buysell incentives punishments and behaviours Mechanism Design of FEI Protocol Fundamentals Incentives Punishments SupplyDemandMechanism design is the design of rules governing the system participants and general token usabilityFree AlphaWith stablecoins one needs to bootstrap the community since most of the value of stablecoins come from their usability To bootstrap FEI is sold at a discount and capped at 101 If you enter the bonding early eg 099 you get to profit from the difference between the price you purchased at and the market value 1Free TRIBEEven at 101 people are still purchasing FEI for ETH because they also receive TRIBE Since FEI is technically priced at 1 and if you value TRIBE more than 001 you are getting a deal by receiving TRIBEDirect IncentivesThe mechanism also has direct punishments for users When prices are below 1 and you want to sell it you have to pay a punishment fee That is the difference in cents squared So if it is currently priced at 095 the difference is 005 And the punishment is 025 That means your FEI is really worth 075In this case the value before punishment cannot be less than 090 since the squared difference is 1 That means at 090 per FEI before punishment you are selling FEI for nothing in returnAnd this is important because it leads to the effects of a circular economy explained next Conclusion Right now the practical thing could be to sell ETH and reimburse users who lost money Ideally the VCs backing the protocol can use their power and influence to do something good But realistically the truth is that the protocol needs to build faith and trust in the system again The problem is that it is extremely challenging Once trust and faith are broken it is very difficult to restore themNonetheless this is a great experiment It brings in features of DeFi bonding curve quadratic fees and DEX liquidity mechanism It is great to experiment by bringing them together However more analysis and modelling could have been done before launching the protocolWhen launching projects in a bull market it is easy to receive liquidity and support But do not force to test test and test again Were building the future Its not just about design and builds Test test and test again,Neutral,0.5170239210128784

our profile This is not financial advice Economics like to assume that people are rational Yet humans are the most irrational being in the world We have so many biases assumptions and we are influenced so easilyRemember in EP 3 I mentioned that digital economics is a closed loop system In this closed loop system we get to engineer incentives towards the targeted desired outcomeHow do we do this Through behavioural economics And this is the first underlying principle to manage an ecosystem It takes into consideration the irrationality of peoples behaviourIn this episode we will dive into 1 What behavioural economics is 2 Why are we like that Why are we so prone to influence 3 How can we apply behavioural economics applied to token economics What is Behavioural EconomicsBehavioural economics is a specific field of economics research It studies the effects of social norms and individual psychology on economics decisions In classical economics we assume that everyone is logical In behavioural economics we study why people are illogical and why they behave like thatFor example buying a 2 weeks worth of food during a pandemic is logical But buying endless rolls of toilet paperSome possible answersThe thing about panicbuying is that it gives us a sense of control at a time when were lacking that says Deborah Small a psychologist who studies consumer judgment and human decisionmaking at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School of Business She adds that things get harried when people hear that other people are buying something and they say Oh I need that too And it just spirals to this level where we have none People compare and when everyone is doing it they are more likely to do it too Its the herd mentality Some people dont know what they want until they see it in context Everything is relative and if there is relatively less toilet paper than say noodles and rice the irrational side is more interested in toilet paper To make people desire things making that thing difficult to attain reduces the logical side Toilet papers were literally out of stock and attaining it is very difficult 3 Themes There are 3 themes to behavioural economics heuristics framing and market inefficienciesHeuristicsIn Daniel Kahnemans book thinking fast and slow he introduced 2 thinking systems in our head System 1 thinks fast System 2 thinks slow Humans are not only illogical but we are also super lazy You would rather watch more mindless Netflix than solve a very difficult mathematics problemThats not all your fault really Our brains are lazy and we like to take shortcuts We like to take the path of least resistance We like the easy way Thats where System 1 comes in System 1 learns from experience and it becomes a mental shortcut Or a rule of thumb You know how you can customise commands on Siri or Alexa Same thing Our brain does that So we can conserve our energy when we need to think moreThats good right Yeah but no We make 95 of our decisions with this shortcut tool and the decisions does not consider other new information that is availableFramingThe world is a very complicated place Things are difficult to understand How does internet work How does emails work What the hell is bitcoin Why is the government doing what it is doingWell this is why we have anecdotes stories and stereotypes It is easier to understand complicated things when it is simplified They also become a mental filter for us to rely on understandingThink of Instagram filters It is a set of fixed filters that is applied to our faces But it doesnt always work Sometimes we end up with strange glitches Our brains being lazy apply these filters Sometimes glitch happens And we make illogical decisionsMarket InefficienciesSo what about heuristics and framing Ultimately it creates market inefficiencies What are market inefficiencies Pricing things wrongly making illogical decisions etc Why Study Behavioural Economics With economics we like to predict things so we can make the best decisions With classical economics we assume that people are rational Turns out they are not So with behavioural economics we can predict peoples irrationality that defy economic theory Basically we can predict better now How There are a few ways but a major way is called Prospect Theory We evaluate options based on alternativesLets say I tell you that I will give you 100 followers on your LinkedIn The value of that 100 followers depends on how many followers you currently have 100 is the absolutely value But 100 can be a lot psychologically depending on the reference point For someone with 500 followers and it is nothing for someone with 10000 followers We also experience different sensitivity to the changes in followers Adding 100 when you start with 500 feels better than adding 100 when you start with 10000 followers And we do love having more followers who value and appreciate the work we doIf you dont remember anything just remember that decisions are reference dependence We need references to evaluate outcomes And people dont evaluate options equally It depends on the changes relative to the reference point in absolute value People are happier when the difference is smaller than when the difference is too hugeFor example 100 followers added to an account with 500 followers vs 10000 followers Why are we like that Why are we so prone to influence We have two levels of thinking We have our rational mind that tells us No I dont need to buy another roll of toilet paper But we also have a more primitive visceral gut reaction that says Well I better be safe than sorry There will be no more toilet paper anymoreThe herd instinct can also kick in where people suspend judgement and start doing what everyone else is doing So if everyone else is panicbuying supplies people follow the herdHeuristics influence our choices which are irrational and counter intuitive we need help making better choicesWe are prone to influence in 6 ways 1 Reciprocation when someone does a favour for you you are more likely to return the favour some day For example in crisis like this China sends their doctors to Italy to help with the pandemic I am certain this act will be reciprocated by Italy to China some day down the future 2 Social ProofConsensus If you are in the blockchain space are you sick of the word consensus Consensus just means something the mass agrees to It is also a form of social proof because if everyone agrees to it it is likely to be right For example if the WHO and government of major countries think that the virus requires a lockdown and pause on the economy other countries are likely to follow suite and agree that it is the right course of action Im not saying it is irrational to do so Im just saying we can be easily influenced by the action that most people agree to do 3 Authority I notice this early on in my life Ive been to many events and conferences where just because the speaker is an older caucasian dude talking about things people just believe him And when I stand up to correct the information it always starts with looks of who you think you are young asian female But when coherent points and arguments are made the audience starts to view me with more authority We think with our fast thinking brain called System 1 And we apply stereotypes that we previously had Its fine though I think as long as one is open to changes and be aware of the fast thinking that we have 4 Liking Believe or not people like beautiful looking people and people that are similar to us Model selling us something will influence us to purchase it more than some random ugly person on the street We also like people who are similar to us because familiarity is something we all love Thats why nostalgia sells We end up getting influenced easily this way 5 Scarcity We simply want something more just because we cant have it Why is Bitcoin so sought after There will only be 21M Bitcoin in existence Is there a real purpose for Bitcoin other than being a digital asset for investment Maybe Who knows We are influenced and so captivated by the idea of scarcity and that you can own something that someone else doesnt have Who is the best example of this Supreme and everything that Supreme sells They sell scarcity And people are influenced to pay 100 for a brick 6 Commitment Consistency Lastly consistency and commitment We are more influenced by someone consistent in their message For example Bernie Sanders and his message during his lifetime career of being a politician Or commitment by Sanders as he campaigns the same message all the time We are more influenced by people who are committed and consistent None of these make logical sense but hey we are not always logical right How can we apply behavioural economics applied to token economics Firstly it fits into Layer 2 of the economics design frameworkLayer 1 is the system architecture That is the nerdy things and coded in algorithms or hard coded in the system The framework is available as a research paperLayer 1 is limited because it is based on classical economics and assumes rationality of people Weve already learnt that that fails So we need Layer 2Layer 2 is a game design that embeds behavioural economics into the experience Think of user experience plus gamification Gamified Systems We can increase the probability of peoples irrational actions through design For example I have 3 optionsA fruit basket for 15B candy bars for 10C fruit basket and candy bars for 15What would you get Most probably option CPeople rarely choose things in absolutely terms We simply dont have an internal value meter for what things are worth It is easier when the item is being compared to get its internal valueExample exchange tokensExchange tokens gather its value when traders get to pay in fiat crypto or the native exchange tokens When they get a better deal with the exchange tokens they are more likely to want to get the tokens instead of selling it in the secondary market Eg BNB token Nudge Theory Nudge is a concept which proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals Basically influencing peoples independent actions towards the behaviour you wantIts kind of like Pavlov and his dogs Ring the bell and the dog salivate But it is more than just that An example is Amsterdams Schiphol Airport attaching an image of a housefly into the mens room urinals Men would pee to aim at the housefly and cleanliness of the urinal went up I guess men are not good at peeingExample deflationary tokenA simple example is deflationary tokens Tokens have limited supply and when demand soars the price of tokens will increase How can we nudge the demand By reducing supply available like staking to be a validator or staking to earn interest on stakes The behaviour you want is to reduce available supply so as to increase prices So you can influence the behaviour by having a better tradeoff earning interest on tokens staked 6 Influence Methods 1 Reciprocation By adding value first before extracting value For example Crypto com provides valueadd like free netflix free amazon prime and free spotify when you sign up with their cards 2 Social ProofConsensus The simplest example would be Augur the online betting platform But that is their business model so it doesnt count Why is Bitcoin so valuable Almost all cryptopeople I know have assets in Bitcoin The social proof is strong When prices of Bitcoin fell on 16 Mar 2020 instead of liquidating more social media was asking everyone to purchase more since prices were so low That consensus brought prices of BTC up again in 24h 3 Authority Authority comes from the background of the founders their experience educational background and street cred in the space This is most evident in blockchain projects by academic professors like Silvio Micali who founded Algorand 4 Liking I still find this funny but in Asia you see companies hiring pretty females to model for their cryptoprojects And according to plenty of my male friends in the space these girls do a great job at influencing males to sign up for their projects 5 Scarcity We simply want something more just because we cant have it Following Bitcoins path of limited supply every other project has a capped supply of tokens to induce scarcity 6 Commitment Consistency When Bitcoins price fell on 16 Mar the community was selling bitcoin hard on twitter and reddit Its interesting because these people have quite some BTC in their portfolio and they need to pump up the prices and continue the faith that BTC is worth something Whatever it is they are consistent in their message and truly committed in their shilling Conclusion In conclusion many design of these crypto systems fail even with beautiful mathematical formula is that they miss out behavioral economicsEconomics design of the crypto ecosystems are in 2 layersLayer 1 is the system architecture That is the nerdy things and coded in algorithms or hard coded in the system For example matching algorithms resolution mechanisms and monetary policyLayer 2 is a game design that embeds behavioural economics into the experience That is user psychology plus gamificationIf designing an ecosystem is like making creme brle behavioural economics is using the blowtorch to caramalise the sugar to light golden brown Its a very crucial and important step 3 Discussion Takeaways Worth Pondering 1 Do you think designers need to abide by some regulations to ensure the morality of how systems are designed It could go out of hand to influence peoples decisions This is evident in the countless of scams

are a developer affects you depending on what are you building You are a regulator affects you depending on what you want to regulate 1 Layer 1 Layer 1 is just the base layerIf you imagine theres blockchain has different a kind of blocks this is basic layer 1 as in a tech stack and then on top you could have another kind of systems processes and technological stackCrypto Examples Bitcoin Ethereum and Polkadot These are different kinds of layer 1 solutions and you could build things on top of themTech world examples IMAP protocol to send your email from gmail com to yahoo com is the distinction important The economics involved in layer one is very different from the economics of layer 2 and the other kind of layers 2 Layer 2 If layer 1 is the base layer layer 2 is something thats being built upon it Layer 2 is usually the scalable solutions and that helps transactions fasterLayer 1 is good The objective is to send data in a distributed way and to make sure the other attacks dont happen Thats security And usually it means to sacrifice scalability Layer 2 solves thisCrypto Examples Lightning network Plasma chain and zkRollupsTech world examples 5G vs 2GWhy is layer 2 important It helps with mainstream adoption for other digital products and services that need speed 3 Dapp Dapps are decentralised applications They can be related to finance DeFi esports usually NFT

DeFi General Terms Another set of terms you hear often These are general finance terms specific to crypto You are a retail cryptotrader affects you Basically your bread and butter You are a developer affects you depending on what are you building You are a regulator affects you depending on what you want to regulate 4 DeFi DeFi decentralised financeDeFi looks to reduce intermediaries in the financial space by decentralising the operations That is different from the capital market aka traditional centralised finance Sometimes that is known as TradFi or CeFiWhat will be decentralised The entire governance mechanism and technology layer will be completely decentralised And the beginning for DeFi was Bitcoin a peertopeer currencyNow the cryptocurrency space has grown a bit more We have lending platforms dexchanges derivatives insurance and the aggregators So decentralised finance has developed a lot of things beyond just p2p lending and BitcoinDeFi Examples P2P currency and technology to remove doublespendingCeFi examples Currency issued by the central bankWhy is DeFi important It opens up financial access to everyone without intermediaries 5 Money Lego Go back to being a child You are playing with Lego You can stack them up and create different types of Lego structureNow you are an adult You play with a different type of Lego Its money Lego That means the various technological pieces as lego bricks to build new financial product or infrastructureMore specifically it is to combine various products lending exchange options insurance and connect them to other productsFor Example we have ETH and want to tradehedge So that we can mortgage ETH on Compound to receive DAI and transfer DAI to a pool on Uniswap to buy more ETH Or we can go to derivatives platform and hedge our positions This is Money Lego that you can stack many types of protocolsDeFi Examples Collateralise ETH on Compound to borrow DAI lending and exchange it for Cream exchange and use Cream to stake in various liquidity pools to get an annualised returnCeFi world examples A similar example is RepoWhy is Money Lego important This allows for each protocol to specialise in a specific financial instrument and allow anyone to use them as a tool to create new products 6 Composability Composability is a systems design principle A protocol can be broken down by different functions and its functions can be used for other purposes Compostability is very similar to Money LegoDifferent protocols are created with specific purposes but you can use their functions to achieve your goalsFor example you can combine the loan functionality of Compound exchange from Uniswap and provide liquidity on Sushiswap to create a decentralised derivative exchange with one click Instead of building everything from scratch Thats the general idea of DeFi which is evolving very quickly,Bullish,0.5608761310577393

articles on our SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice When we discuss risks in crypto we look at both risks from the perspective of token owners and risks from the protocol By knowing their major sources of risk exposures we can have a better picture of what the protocol will possibly be like in the long term and a more thorough understanding of the whole crypto space In this article we will walk through a general framework and additional points to consider for financial risk analysis of stablecoins General classification of risk Before moving on to financial risk in details lets recap on the general classification of risk that we are using Under our analytical framework risk is either systematic or idiosyncratic Systematic risk are the ones that affect the whole market and cannot be well controlled by the protocol itself This includes the market risk like price variations failure of underlying blockchain layer and irregular user behaviour Meanwhile Idiosyncratic risk are the ones that are relevant to token and mechanism design which can be controlled by the protocol to some extent and only directly affects the particular protocol itself Fig 1 General risk classification Under our definition financial risk is a type of idiosyncratic risk It describes the risk of losing money in operation which is predominantly determined by how the token is designed under the protocol Financial risk for stablecoins comes from two main areas cashflow and collaterals Financial risk from cashflow When conducting risk analysis cashflow is often one of the most direct and easily analyzable sources of risk Changes in cashflow for the protocol over time gives information on how well the protocol is operating and also its ability of pulling through a crisis Meanwhile cross comparison of cashflow figures and growth with other protocols can show which tokens in the market are in better financial standing and hence likely to be more sustainable In the long term protocols with healthier cashflow conditions are more likely to gain investor confidence and attract more people in buying the tokens This is extremely important for stablecoins as their values are pegged to a previously specified amount with very minimal variation in monetary values Investors make decisions to buy stablecoins based on how they plan to utilize the token and also whether the token is reliable in the future The most common way to analyze financial risk from cashflow is to break down the incoming and outgoing cash over fixed time intervals and compare their growth Depending on how the protocol is designed income and expense can be further classified into subcategories based on where they come from such as interest trading and operating Significant changes in the proportions of each category may indicate structural changes in the protocols financial performance Advancing to a higher level of analysis we can look at the key ratios calculated from cashflow data These key ratios are created based on the data available for each protocol to compare income and expense data with the important token metrics such as price transaction volume and market capitalization Some of the possible key ratios that can be considered but not limited to are the following Percentage of each subcategory of income and expense Ratio of cash inflow to outflow Protocol net income to market capitalization Protocol revenue income to market capitalization Changes in these ratios give information on how the protocol has been growing over time which helps us to identify the stage of development and expected amount of variations in finance performance to better gauge their level of risk exposures Given the complexity of token data and the fact that most protocols have only been created in the very recent years we are still unable to form a clear cutoff for these ratios to distinguish between the different levels of risk Nonetheless these ratios can be used for comparison across time and market Also we will expect newer projects to have less stable financials so the seemingly negative ratios in the early stage may not lead to the conclusion that protocol is facing high financial risk But for projects that have existed for years with a stable pool of users significant variations of key ratios may hint there could be changes in operation that changed the token holders decisions and unhealthy cashflow Financial risk from collaterals Another significant source of financial risk of stablecoins comes from the collaterals In the token market today stablecoins maintain stability of value through collaterals or algorithmic mechanisms that balances the reserved assets The types of collaterals used directly impacts buying decisions of the stablecoin hence play an important role in determining the financial risk exposures To analyze such risk we will first look at how the stablecoin maintains its value whether the reserve is made up of onchain assets other tokens offchain assets cash and cash equivalents a combination of the two or through algorithms with no reserve or partial reserve 1 Onchain collateral For stablecoins collateralized with onchain assets such as DAI and LUSD the degree of transparency is often the highest as collateral data can be queried We can study the composition of collaterals including what are the assets making up the collateral pool collaterization ratio of each type of asset and if there had been any significant changes in the structure of collateral pool in the past For a stablecoin to be considered as having low financial risk exposure the collateral pool should be relatively stable with no significant flux in proportion of each asset type The collateralization ratio should also be set to a reasonable range such that the value of collateral reserve can still sustain if there is a sudden decrease in collateralized asset prices but also not to an overly high level that discourages investors from holding the token 2 Offchain collateral For stablecoins collateralized with offchain assets such as cash commercial paper fiduciary deposits secured loans short term treasury bills corporate bonds and other investments For these tokens financial risk exposure is lower when the proportion of cash is higher as a reserve pool will have better ability to deal with unexpected situations that require high liquidity of assets On the other end tokens backed with assets that cannot be readily converted to cash may not stabilize to its pegged value when there is a sudden drop in collateral value An important point to note here is that some protocols do not give a clear breakdown on the components of their fiat reserve Instead of disclosing the proportion of cash they report the proportion of cash and cash equivalents together to make the numbers more appealing to investors Such lack of transparency will also lead to doubts and inconfidence thereby increasing financial risk exposure 3 Noncollateralized Lastly there is also a group of stablecoins that uses supplychanging algorithms to maintain its token price to a pegged value Some of these tokens are partially backed by onchain and offchain reserves while others are uncollateralized For these algorithmic coins we need to make specific analysis according to their structure of collateral If they are completely unbacked we can instead focus on the financial cashflow and ability of these tokens to maintain at a stable price Financial risk from token performance In addition to factors arising from token design and mechanism tokens performance is also a critical factor of financial risk These include the ability of the stablecoin pegging to a specific monetary value market dominance and applied uses that directly affect tokens transaction activities and income Low price volatility indicates that the token is wellbacked by collaterals or supply is under control by algorithms hence has better ability to store and maintain monetary value This will attract more people to hold the stablecoin and more platforms to utilise it We can also consider indicators like market dominance and overall ranking of the stablecoin in the whole token market Tokens with better rankings are likely to have more investors and transaction volume which bring a stable income stream and enhances the protocols resilience against financial risk Conclusion Just like the case for many other financial assets risk analysis for stablecoins is a complex process with no clear distinctions or standards and we may face many difficulties in deducing the level of risk present But going from the main sources of risk from financial performance collaterals and token performance we can get a general picture of the financial risk exposures of a protocol Due to the difference in design and mechanism of the various protocols a thorough risk analysis needs to cover multiple aspects and may require analysts to create new metrics specifically applicable to the protocol Some additional points to consider here include the time frame of data used as financial risk is a long term concept that is hard to predict if there are unexpected changes in token design after governance voting or new regulation being implemented Some metrics may also have doublesided impact on financial risk For example overcollateralization gives a stable cash reserve to sustain through a financial shock but also leads to large amounts of funds unused which may hinder tokens scalability in the long term Thus we need to be aware of these limitations understand the interactions between different types of risks and make careful judgements when determining the level of risk exposures,Bullish,0.6697368621826172

SubStack D Link on our profile This is not financial advice General Conclusion Last week we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin Today we are talking about the agrarian society 20 I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms Today we are talking about yield farming the modern day agriculture Instead of harvesting crops we are harvesting tokens Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition Its basically mining tokens by using the protocol ie executing trade Its attractive because its possible to get a 100 APY But it comes with risks 1 Projects Using Yield Farming Sythetix issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider It worked since sETH tokens make up 13 of uniswaps liquidity pool Curve Finance issue native tokens like SNX REN BAL CRV to liquidity providers Compound The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker the top DeFi app It is the primary market for a decentralised money market Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market Balancer Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume Before the distribution volume had generally been under 2 million Since the distribution it has generally been around 4 million But on Sunday June 28 volume shot up to 14 million 2 Good Bad Ugly Good It works This native token is an incentive for liquidity providers That is exactly what exchange platforms are doing with their native tokens too by incentivising market makers It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens It works of the platform because they are onboarding new users Good Projects like these are way beyond the stage of just a white paper We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base Bad This is still a shortterm incentive that is not sustainable What happens when the hype of trading is gone Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade Or when tokens are all given out Bad So far it seems like the yield is a zerosum game If you dont know how to play you should not participate It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie but for now it is a beautiful zero sum It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses If you dont have insider knowledge or strategic advantage you are not earning yield You are the yield Ugly The real ugly part is the hidden string attached Due to all the trade going on on ethereum gas fees have shot through the roof So beware of gas fees slippage fee asset volatility Ugly Leveraged trading can be good to secure greater upsides but the downside can also be quite steep especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps Ugly Because there are so many transactions that may or may not be inflated the transaction fees have soared So Ethereum is looking to increase the block size This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns but this is ugly risk in the long run because ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network 3 Economics of Yield Farming Token Design SelfReinforcing Mechanism The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop Valuation at the end of the day this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value for protocols and projects to succeed it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time and not just during this movement In the short term we are also seeing an increase in token value Token supply this is a token supply increase or supply inflation It is also distributed to users with the highest volume Instead of people paying for tokens it is earned via the platform Return of tokens These tokens are not exactly free early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns you are just part of the plan Similar to IPO Pop Transaction activities borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution it is almost like they are subsidised to pay The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders Apply To Your Project This is a typical method for issuing tokens based on transaction volume as we see in exchange tokens Check out the BNB episode for the economics of that Yield farming is a growth hacking way to achieve network effects It uses shortterm incentives to drive user growth At the end of the day we are looking at the bigger game In the longrun how sustainable will the platform be The real economic value comes from building products that benefits users in a sustainable manner not with hypes and pumps That means actual financial activity for DeFi protocols so that monetary value increase is not just driven by sophisticated leveraged speculation but real valueadd TLDR For cryptoentrepreneurs and longterm investors yield farming works But it is still a shortterm incentive and not a longterm solution So use this method with precaution,Neutral,0.5409365892410278

Liquidity Mining Exploring the Options Since at least 2019 Web3 projects have been incentivizing their communities to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges Liquidity is the lifeblood of any protocol and facilitating that liquidity in one way or another is a basic prerequisite for a successful project When Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap were the dominant DEXes liquidity mining was relatively straightforward All liquidity deposits on those exchanges are natively fungible meaning that any deposit is directly comparable to any other one Additionally all liquidity deposits on those exchanges cover the full price range of the two assets in the pool meaning that the AMM formula would serve up a price if token0 approached an infinite value relative to token1 and similarly if token1 approached an infinite value relative to token0 Uniswap V3 is now the dominant DEX owing largely to its more expressive functionality But with a richer featureset comes greater complexity One major casualty of Uniswap V3 is that liquidity mining now requires a profound technical expertise Even launching an incentive on the full price range the most common approach to Uni V3 LM to date still necessitates a degree of complexity Fear not Web3projectslookingtoincentivizeUniswapV3liquidity A variety of teams are hard at work building solutions to simplify this process Naturally the team building xToken Terminal believes weve built the most secure complete and powerful solution However well still run through all the options that are out there in order to provide you with the most complete set of information x200B A basic summary of the feature sets for different Uniswap V3 liquidity mining options xToken Terminal Terminal is our new capital markets platform designed to provide DeFiNFT projects and whoever else seamless and permissionless access to fundamental onchain primitives The first of these primitives is Uniswap V3 liquidity mining Via Terminal a Web3 project can have a Uni V3 LM program up and running in a few minutes No dev work or Uniswap expertise required Pool sponsors select a liquidity pool and price range to incentivize one or more rewards tokens to pay out to LPs and an optional vesting period on rewards Once the liquidityrewards pool is deployed sponsors can initiate a rewards program for any amount over any period Once a rewards program ends sponsors can initialize a new one Sponsors never need to leave the Terminal UI Similarly LPs never need to leave the Terminal UI LPs do not need to mint an NFT position the sponsor mints a communal NFT on pool deployment or navigate to alternative UIs to deposit liquidity pool tokens Data on staked balances APR pool history etc are all generated permissionlessly and viewable on the Terminal interface Terminal is available on L1 Arbitrum Optimism and Polygon x200B Gelato GUni Similarly to Terminal Gelato also provides a fungible interface for a nonfungible Uniswap V3 liquidity position While Gelato does not actively rebalance liquidity positioning the protocol provides a manager role on their contracts that allows a representative of a project to actively reposition if desired GelatoGUni does not provide any infrastructure for staking rewards rewards vesting or rewards data Projects using GUni tokens for liquidity mining will need to deployconfigure smart contracts and build a custom frontend UniswapV3Staker The UniswapV3Staker contract is the most native option available to projects looking to sponsor a liquidity mining program The contract requires LPs to mint a Uni V3 NFT position and then deposit it Rewards are paid out as a function of inrange liquidity ie the more trading volume your position helps generate the more rewards you will earn This approach may be the most rooted in precision but in practice it has been marred by manipulation as well as a bevy of UX challenges It also requires deep Uniswap V3 knowledge to fully understand Lastly were not aware of a fullfeature UI for projects that wish to use the UniswapV3Staker contract Some community members have proposed a few modifications to the contract notably a change that requires LPs to cover a minimum price tick range This change is likely to mitigate some or all of the issues related to manipulation of rewards however it is unlikely to allay any UX challenges Charm Charms Alpha vaults rely on some of the most clever Uniswap V3 liquidity management logic that can be found in the space Charms vaults rebalance in a way that avoids a direct swapping of assets instead relying on singlesided pseudolimit orders a Uniswap V3 hallmark Sidenote many Uni V3 liquidity managers underestimate the slippage costs and gas costs of active rebalancing strategies thus overestimating the expected value of a rebalance Maximizing capital efficiency at a given moment does not necessarily lead to maximization of value Charm is soon to release a permissionless version of their vaults Alpha Pro It remains to be seen whether their approach which is welltested and successful on high liquidity pairs like ETHUSDC will be performant programmatically or otherwise on long tail pools At launch Alpha Pro will not offer the smart contract or user interface architecture for native liquidity mining Gamma Gamma pursues a more active rebalancing strategy relying at least partially on offchain logic that is not transparent to LPs Though decentralization advocates may protest there may be something to be said for this more obscured approach as purely onchain rebalance strategies may be vulnerable to frontrunning or other forms of value extraction Gamma is in the midst of remodeling their approach to liquidity management so some elements of this description may no longer be accurate Gamma pools are not permissionless and there is no native liquidity mining architecture A Note on Rebalancing We at xToken have been demoing our new platform for a variety of projects in the space Weve been excited by the positive feedback weve received on the platforms easeofuse configurability and extensibility Several projects have asked us why we dont offer the ability to rebalance positioning in a pool As the product currently operates pool sponsors must set a price range at deployment and are unable to modify that price range although deploying a new pool with new price range takes only a few minutes While we are exploring methods of introducing this functionality we believe that offering a rebalance feature on a permissionless platform like ours could expose our users to frontrunning and other forms of value extraction Why is that We have experience with Uni V3 repositioning from our time managing xU3LP which for several months was the largest provider of managed Uniswap V3 liquidity It turns out that rebalancing must be executed very carefully especially when the position in question is responsible for the lions share of liquidity on the Uniswap pair this concentration of pool ownership is likely the case for many LM programs In carefully researching management strategies for xU3LP we witnessed many instances of LP rebalances being frontrun by bots onchain In short rebalancing large Uniswap V3 positions requires a level of expertise and sophistication uncommon in the space Get in Touch Interested in learning more about xToken Terminal Join us in Discord or

running crypto for the homeless We recently just had our 3 year anniversary 42819 start date a couple months ago this post is a little bit late For those of you who dont know crypto for the homeless CFTHL is a nonprofit organization I created with the intention of doing something unique with crypto while at the same time helping the needy I started it completely out of pocket at the start and was able to get the organization of its feet immediately due to the massive support shown from social media mainly reddit I never set out to solve homelessness as I think that is a systemic problem that even governments can not fix but rather to reintroduce a human aspect of charity that I felt was sorely missing from most other projects at least in my opinion We differentiated ourselves by utilizing all of the funds we received thus far on foodgoods for the homeless and also delivering food straight to the homelessneedy In addition to this we have photo documentation of all food hand outs as well as receipts dating back to the very first time we handed out food 3 full years of photos at this point which I believe no other charity has come close to doing While we had very humble beginnings we are proud to have 501c3 status for 2 years now and also recently launched our brand new website check it out We also have had a massive amount of volunteer support people buy and hand out food for us and get reimbursed in crypto Our partners in New Zealand have been doing the most amazing work consistently for us and I could not be prouder here is an album of some of their recent work In terms of donations we have received enough roughly 75000 thus far to last us probably a decade or more of work at our current rate if we ration the spending to maintain our current rate which I view as a massive success and also a guarantee of our longevity Ive learned a ton from running this project thus far and Ive used a lot of it to try and improve the project if possible 1 It is impossible to satisfy 100 of people with ANY project for this one in particular there are those who oppose helping homeless people in general and thus they will inherently hate this project no matter what I do 2 It is impossible to make this project 100 trustless despite what most people who have that criticism say It is ultimately a project based on human work and the best that Iwe can do is provide a massive amount of proof of work which we have that should be used as a basis of our legitimacy At this point having 3 years of photos as well as documenting over 20000 donations in monero should be more than enough proof of our legitimacy in addition to reimbursing 100 of our volunteers who participated properly 3 A lot of people want to steer the project in many different directions ultimately the projects design is a very personal thing when it comes down to it I personally created it with a very specific vision in mind and that may not align with what youor other people feel the best vision is That is perfectly fine and yo are free to create a project to carry out that vision in the same way I have carried out mine Projects like this cost timemoney and the very fact that enough supporters on the internet have funded this project to last us 10 years now at least shows that we have a reason to exist I am beyond grateful for this support and intend to respect the intentions of our donors for the extreme long term Which brings us to future plans We currently have a couple people including myself dedicating quite a lot of time each day working on the websitessocial mediacommunicating with volunteer prospectsetc There are actually a lot of things that occur behind the scenes that are very time consuming and we could use 1 or 2 more people working with us on the team on various things social mediaengagementetc This is one of our top priorities right now so if this is something you can see yourself doing please reach out to me even if the amount of time you can commit is small Also as I have stated earlier we are proud of the fact that all of the funds thus donated to us have been entirely dedicated to the buying and reimbursing of foodgoods for the homeless and I intend to keep it that way One repeated suggestion that I have had was to pay our employees for their time even minimal Because of our pledge to not use the funds for that purpose at the start we had to come up with a different solution which is as follows these are wallets we set up for the sole purpose of optional support to provide our employees again this is just to have the option there we absolutely do not require anything to continue to operate but if you want to support the employees that have been working completely free since the start this is the way to do it That about sums it up for now I hope we metexceeded the expectations of those of you who have followed us from the beginning if not we will try even harder going forward Feel free to post any and all criticismsuggestionssupportanything and we will take it all in,Bullish,0.5447016358375549

United States CPA and the dir of tax strategy at CoinLedger Over the past year Ive spent a lot of time diving deep into the taxability of DeFi and I thought it might be helpful to share some of my research with the community Theres a problem with current DeFi tax advice online in our communities Your typical tax accountants cannot provide useful tax advice on DeFi transactions without already having you as a client because taxability is not only unique to each persons situation but the taxability of using each DeFi protocol is also unique This is why Im currently going through an analysis of ALL major DeFi protocols to lay out a complete tax analysis for each protocol and thus better equip our industry with the knowledge they need At CoinLedger we aim to give people the tax knowledge to handle crypto taxes on their own and in turn reduce the friction of interacting with the crypto economy Its important for me to note that this complete tax analysis is not specific tax advice for your situation but rather the tax principles on how Uniswap transactions can generally be handled Reach out to a tax accountant for more specific guidance for your situation I would love to hear your feedback or answer any specific questions you have on the below Taxability of using Uniswap Executing a swap Trade an ERC20 token that you own for another token Sells currently owned tokens for proportional amount of the tokens desired minus the swap fees Taxability When conducting a swap there is a disposal of the tokens you are selling which creates taxable gain or loss Taxable gain or loss is calculated by taking the value of what you received from selling the tokens your proceeds minus your cost to acquire your basis Fees are included in taxability calculations For detail see fee section at the bottom Providing Liquidity Taxability of adding or removing liquidity in Uniswap v2 Execution You add liquidity to a pool by contributing two ERC20 tokens equal in value in exchange for liquidity pool tokens representing your position These tokens automatically earn fees proportional to your share of the pool Network fees are paid to approve and confirm the transaction You remove liquidity from a pool by exchanging your liquidity pool tokens representing your position in the pool for your two original ERC20 tokens Network fees are paid to approve and confirm the transaction Taxability There is no explicit guidance from the IRS and other tax offices as to the taxability of providing liquidity we must rely on already existing cryptocurrency tax guidance and general tax principles Except with the UKs HMRC their guidance views this as a taxable gain or loss event The tax key question here is whether combining two tokens into a liquidity pool token is considered a disposal of your original tokens in exchange for your pool tokens If so there is taxable gain or loss Its reasonable to assume that the IRS and other tax offices will consider adding liquidity as a taxable disposal of your tokens in exchange for pool tokens The additional rights fee collection and responsibilities impermanent loss that comes with the pool tokens make a great argument as to how the pool tokens are a different asset compared to the original ERC20 tokens in which case adding liquidity should be taxable By treating the addition of liquidity as a capital gain event the blockchain network fee charged can be included taxability calculations see fee section at the bottom The taxability of removing liquidity is the same as providing liquidity the difference being which asset is acquired and which asset is disposed Adding or removing liquidity in Uniswap v3 Execution You add liquidity to a pool by contributing two ERC20 tokens equal in value and you can choose to concentrate your capital within custom price ranges In exchange for contributing your two tokens you receive an NFT representing your pool position This NFT automatically earns fees proportional to your share of the pool Network fees are paid to approve and confirm the transaction You remove liquidity from a pool by exchanging your NFT representing your position in the pool for your two original ERC20 tokens Network fees are paid to approve and confirm the transaction Taxability The taxability of Uniswap v3 is generally the same as v2 Its reasonable to assume that adding liquidity is a taxable disposal of your tokens in exchange for the NFT representing your pool position Fees are included in taxability calculations The taxability of removing liquidity is the same as providing liquidity the difference being which asset is acquired and which asset is disposed Collecting fees in Uniswap Execution Fees collected are allocated to your liquidity pool tokens by increasing the value of your pool tokens This is in contrast to earning new tokens which is sometimes seen in other defi protocols Taxability Generally there is no income to pick up from collecting fees as the additional value accumulates within the pool tokens Any income earned on any fees are taken into account when you remove liquidity and have a capital gain or loss Fees You get a tax benefit from swap and blockchain fees which can be included in the gainloss calculation when calculating your proceeds from a sale or your basis upon an acquisition as the fees reduce what you get out from the trade Calculating the fees on cryptotocrypto exchanges can be tricky because these transactions are both an acquisition and a sale so how do you allocate the tax benefit from the swap fees There is no right answer here as long as youre not doublecounting the tax benefit of the swap fees At CoinLedger we accelerate the tax benefit by reducing the amount of proceeds from the sell side of the swap rather than increasing the basis of the newly acquired tokens This way you have a reduction of gainloss from the swap fees right away the benefit wont be delayed like it would if you allocated to the basis of the newly acquired tokens Fees come with a tax benefit as mentioned above but in addition since fees are paid with crypto this is also a disposal of the tokens used to pay the fee This is because you are using a capital asset to purchase a service for Uniswap protocol to swap your tokensEthereum network to execute your transactions which itself is a taxable disposal of the tokens used to pay the fees Youll have gain or loss based on how the value of these tokens have changed since you acquired them,Neutral,0.5701689124107361

in 2015 when ETH was only 030 Spent a year working as a mechanical engineer at Long Island New York Started working in crypto 5 years ago after being laidoff as a mechanical engineer Interested and excited about the idea of being able to build tools that are not controlled by any single party Studied Solidity and Ethereum development during the early days in crypto Bought ETH when it was 50 Launched Uniswap v1 during the bear market in 2018 There werent any DEXs decentralized lending protocols or NFT marketplaces back then x200B Future of DeFi There have been a bunch of centralized things exploding in the past few months The platforms that custody users funds have very poor levels of transparency very opaque mismanaged users funds DeFi empowers users and gives them access to tools and applications that they can use safely and are all publicly available onchain Most of the platforms right now are controlled by gatekeepers Building more neutral permissionless platforms and competing with each other to build the best products for users Recent incidents showed the importance of the underlying properties and values Evolving DeFi to provide universal ownership access to value and value creation Hoping to bring the DeFi world into the NFT space as well Once regulation comes in NFTs will be used for ownership of all assets and products Getting into the NFT space felt really important in part and to have another service area when it comes to digital ownership and value x200B Future of NFTs with Uniswap Uniswaps new NFT aggregator will let users trade NFTs across 8 marketplaces aggregates all the listings to get the best prices Bringing user bases closer together In the past only 20 of the people who bought NFTs have used a DEX in the past Upgraded the routing system called Universal Router wherein it will enable users to do things like share approvals batch token trades with NFT trades and swap any ERC20 token for any NFTs Universal Router will start on ETH and will expand further on different chains in the future Universal Search Bar where you can search any kind of token The world of tokens NFTs and Web3 is going to be a social place Excited to see social experiences that combine both tokens and NFTs x200B Barriers to overcome The biggest barriers are a combination of scaling and gas costs UX difficulties especially for brand new users Private key management Interface between wallets and dApps Theres huge amounts to do in terms of improving user and onboarding experience x200B Thoughts on current state of the market People who leave during a bear market and people who are here for purely speculation arent interested in building the fundamental value of the space During a bull market everything works During a bear market fundamentals and quality of the projects start to matter The narratives are more around building Focusing on a bunch of product launches and a lot of features Hoping people or reputable brands to continue to call out obvious scams x200B Thoughts on recent incidents People who dont understand crypto very well and have a slightly negative view will think crypto is a mess Decentralization means theres no central point of control and central point of failure Misuse or mismanage of funds is a nature of CeFi to some extent The only thing that works in CeFi in terms of safety is regulation There was no way for users to verify whether or not FTX users funds were being lent out to affiliated market making firms to use for trading or gambling The most powerful things DeFi offers are transparency and selfcustody What happened to FTX happened countless times in TradFi Getting more people educated on selfcustody and making it easier x200B Biggest hurdles of DeFi Only touch centralized platforms when its mostly needed Theres no way to talk to the fiat system without some level of centralization Getting more businesses to accept crypto as payment The more crypto gets integrated into peoples daily lives the less need for on and off ramps The entire mission and goal of Uniswap right now is to make things easier and more accessible x200B Thoughts on Unisocks After raising a seed round with Paradigm in April 2019 hired the first two employees as designer and protocol lead Launched Unisocks in Spring 2019 as an early example of NFT liquidity pools and NFTs being backed by physical assets Given 1000 UNI to holders of Unisocks during the UNI airdrop Anyone who uses Uniswap v3 gets issued an NFT if they created a pool x200B Thought process on NFT aggregator Started looking at the NFT space in January 2021 There was a need to connect all the fragmentation across use cases and technical architectures Uniswap has the best approach towards Web3 and served as a strength to move forward x200B Thoughts on the current product launch Optimizing better prices more listings and performance on a smart contract level Currently pulling prices across 8 different marketplaces for 122M NFTs every second Tapping into decentralized ethos with the product Allowing more competition to grow Working on getting users to be able to bid and accept bids across 8 different marketplaces Prioritizing on enabling users to sell their NFTs instantly in a neat experience Will be posting updates regarding the NFT product more products and fun events x200B Check out these important Follow Revelo Intel

Founder of Panoptic Alex Nizlopi about the future of AMMs LPs all things DeFi x200B Read our notes below to learn more x200B Guillaumes background An assistant professor in Applied Physics at Cornell doing research in Biophysics using Crispr Microfluidics First encountered Ethereum in 2017 Studying Uniswap over the past year and a half Launching a protocol that creates options on top of Uniswap v3 x200B Alexs background Taught at UC Berkeley and NYU CERN Professor at the London school of Economics teaching accounting Started doing research on crypto during the early days of COVID pandemic x200B Summary on Panoptic A perpetual oraclefree options protocol Panoptic is not just an option but also its going to contribute to a more healthy distribution of liquidity within Uniswap because they now have vault traders that could also shape how the community is distributed within the Uniswap pool Enables users to generate different width properties but would get a return that is pretty close to what users would get from setting an option and the pretty close part is the IV of the LP pool Enables you to use the tools from option sellers have been used for the past decades x200B Alex on Adverse selection on LPs Adverse selection is a term that is rooted from TradFi high frequency trading and market making in general The activity of LPing is a bit more passive If the passive LPs were market making in TradFi they would be eaten alive If the bar is set high where theres no latency a user can mint or treat orders within a millisecond scale so being passive will be a losing strategy and since this is a blockchain its physically impossible to create these positions The real benchmark that people use is not necessarily active trading LPs lose massive amounts of money relative to a very simple strategy that doesnt require gas or any active management LPs are like sitting ducks thats being abused by faster resources that are sniping staled orders Guillaume The decision of holding versus participating in a pool is very real in 2017 and 2018 With the current new LPs people have made a decision already that they are either helping or not Most tokens depreciated over the past years in terms of ETH It could have been better holding cash in your bank account LPing is not market making but a different activity LP is selling an options like product and not necessarily comparing holding or comparing what you would get as a market making entity but rather a question of are payoffs going to yield returns from the fees collected When you buy ETH and borrow against it for a different token then lock those into a Uniswap v3 position it is a delta neutral payoff If the price stays in range you can reach more benefits X amount of ETH and Y amount of negative tokens because theyre borrowed and it changes the payoff If its all borrowed you get benefits when the price goes down If its half borrowed you get benefits when the price stays stable If its purchased you get benefits when the price goes up Alex The viable strategy is to buy a second token for wanting to have an exposure to it then not LP on Uniswap The expected value of an investment in LP Uniswap using a negative expected value is losing money We are beginning to talk about expected value vs realizations You can have realization in a state of the world in which you are making money and the question is what happens in expectation You can hope for the prices to go back down to where they started but the results that we have right now is expectation that you make losses When you invest negatively in LP projects with leverage that can even be more problematic than investing in negative LP projects without leverage x200B Guillaume In a scenario where you are an optimized type market maker if it does go back after one block and you have the same price but collected some fees the hypothetical losses are not really realized because you can still be ahead The setting of options business is a dangerous but somewhat rewarding activity LP is not the same PNL as holding and as linear leverage but its rather a complex nonlinear payoff The core basic principle that you have to start with when you LP is that if the token appreciates with respect to ETH youre going to be in the positive EV term x200B Alex LPing on Uniswap has a negative expected value relative to doing exactly the same thing elsewhere but just LPing on Uniswap If that is the only difference do you agree that you lose money on the LP on the Uniswap part Guillaume If you have a deflationary asset then you have a positive delta strategy Of course youll lose at the end of the day x200B Alex If you have a directional prediction for the price then you certainly shouldnt be LPing on Uniswap x200B Guillaume If you have a neutral assumption like what weve seen for the past six months holding actually will be negative or you will lose compared to LPing x200B Alex What many people mean by neutral markets is that the prices are martingale you dont really have anything to say whether an expectation is going down or up If you believe the market is reversing then you shouldnt be LPng on Uniswap there are other great things that you can do like buy high and sell low x200B Guillaume The state of mind of an LP should not be of a trader or spot trader but rather of an option seller The fees that are collected will be the premium for this option but now its an option that doesnt have expiry You collect fees gradually so its a different way of thinking about it x200B Alex Doesnt think that LPing is equivalent to selling options and doesnt think that fees can be interpreted as premiums Limit orders are free options You are not selling them you are writing them for free The fee here is still not the option premium that you collect up front the fee just changes the exercise price of your free option You get a price only when the option is exercised the premium you get up front when you write an option Uniswap allows you to write calls and when somebody exercises one of your calls the protocol writes another on your behalf There is no fee collection If you want to collect premiums then you need to be collecting the premiums upfront before the option is exercised This is how options work x200B Guillaume In Uniswap v3 whatever positions you meant that looked like a covered call no one is buying it on the other side and no one is exercising it but you collect the fees that are generated by every swap Alex Sometimes your options can be exercised efficiently for the taker People in finance have been doing this for decades x200B Guillaume Uniswap makes it very easy for users to get a pretty good price while not having to worry about limit orders or market orders since price is fairly accurate The worst that could happen is that we still relegate all market making and profit taking to the institutions and large players that have more resources Implied volatility even real volatility is still kind of secondary to real market forces x200B Check out these important Follow Revelo Intel for more notes like this Listen to the original Twitter

DefiDave and Kiet talk to Amplice and Ilgiz from Gearbox to discuss their recent launch how composable leverage works and DeFi narratives Also Ghouls x200B Read our notes below to learn more x200B Ilgizs background Have a PhD degree in computer science and math Worked mostly in fintech and banks Joined crypto in 2016 to help build some default projects Joined Gearbox in February 2021 responsible for products staff and risk x200B Amplices background Marketing staff of Gearbox Joined Gearbox in December 2021 x200B What is Gearbox Gearbox builds a composable leverage that is one of the best ways to implement leverage that could work onchain Composability is one of the key features because it allows us to build money blocks and dramatically increase innovation in our space Credit account is the latest smart contract that enables users to deposit initial funds to it to serve as collateral then users can put this credit account some funds that were borrowed from the pools Limits the list of contracts the users can interact with and this makes sure that contracts are not malicious or doesnt contain any hacks Designed an account and policies implementation of each protocol checks allows users to hold leveraged assets on the credit account applied to any whitelisted DeFi protocol and as a result users get leverage and choose the way they want to use it x200B Gearbox Liquidity Pool It works the same way as how pools work in DeFi protocols x200B What makes Gearbox different There are no privilege strategies Built a set of rules and let a protocol or risk team understand what kind of stuff is safe for future providers and add it to the protocol x200B Why keep it onchain Going onchain is very easy to track and understand what happens for all the parties in the protocol When everything is onchain it is safe on a protocol level After building the leverage layer theres no need to focus on different other stuff Integration of Gearbox Wanted to launch with V2 and considering protocols that have a track record of being safe secure and nonexploitable Every protocol that wants to have leverage in their protocol doesnt need to build out a separate layer and can just integrate with Gearbox Anybody can integrate with Gearbox and the only issue is where are the funds drawn from when borrowing Making sure that liquidation is always possible to do at any time and do it with some locking mechanisms or designs to mitigate risk x200B Thoughts on gas optimization The credit account smart contract doesnt have a big overhead to use it and doesnt require interacting with any different protocol x200B Future on smart contract wallets Its an easier way to use some solution that allows people to interact with some limited number of options but solve a lot of other security stuff The wallet experience right now is so bad and it could be better with smart contract wallets Smart contract wallets are inevitable as long as the transaction costs are solved There will be a big user base that will be able to use leverage and understand how it works x200B Gearbox on L2s To understand what kind of L2 Gearbox will go it needs to make sure theres enough liquidity and protocols where users can apply the leverage x200B Thoughts on GMX There is a hidden risk for people It has a very sophisticated design GLP pool design has some interesting tricky points that people will understand after losing or earning money Once their users start making money on their trades which probably is never going to happen because theyre all loser traders GLP will start losing money Traders on GMX are bad traders they dont know what theyre doing and theyre getting wrecked x200B Thoughts on NFTs The Apes are ugly stupid and pointless x200B Next narratives of crypto Zero Knowledge stuff is going to solve a lot of problems that crypto has With ZK instead of every node having to redo the computation it does a very small computation to verify that something is valid and that breaks open the scalability trilemma The broader application of tech is people will have a chance to reclaim their privacy and have the internet be what it was supposed to be Thoughts on development Developers are drawn to Ethereum because its the most decentralized EVM compatibility was important because people just want to fork things What can be done on ZK L2s are so vast that will attract the best developers to do new incredible things Solidity is not where its going to be In Web2 history use cases changing language is very difficult even for large corporations that dominated the market x200B Thoughts on liquidity If most L2s are using ETH as a base layer hopefully that makes bridging and a lot of stuff easier than it might otherwise be There will be a bunch of protocols or solutions that could easily move liquidity from one chain to another x200B Thoughts on Omnichain L0 The riskiest part in the ecosystem is bridging x200B Gearbox marketing strategy The team is involved with a lot of different communities Offering incentives x200B Check out these important Follow Revelo Intel for more notes like this,Bullish,0.6771608591079712

are joined by Ryan Rasmussen and Matt Hougan CIO of BitWise to discuss expected fallout from FTX Coinbases massive market opportunity Bitwises investment products cryptos next big unlock and more x200B Read our notes below to learn more x200B Thoughts on FTX Alameda and regulations It was a classic fraud Its bad for the shortterm and its around 69 months of setback The market is going to pivot from lending and enormous VCs to better CEXs and DEXs and less excess in terms of lending and activity For these types of events the noncrypto enthusiasts are skeptical of crypto and often those in the industry find themselves back against the fence Stablecoins are like the third rail regulatory topic in Washington Suspecting theyll chop it up and try to figure out something for spot crypto exchanges and the DeFi stuff will be harder and take longer This is unfortunately like a two steps back one step forward towards regulations It shows that without proper regulations and clarity that all people have been asking for a long time its letting these bad actors find their way into the industry and flourish in a very negative way Grayscale is a legitimate business and we can all model their revenues because we know what assets they have what theyre earning and thats not going away The contagion story feels like it has calmed down a bit over the past few weeks The market hasnt seen the end of the black swan events yet x200B Coinbases massive opportunity Coinbase is one of the most phenomenal companies in the US If you have a bunch of people with money whove entrusted your organization to hold that money there are ways to monetize besides the most basic way of engaging in transactions Coinbases user count in the past cycle was 20 million and now theres 100 million It is the most important exchange in the world and it has the largest assets on the platform People are looking at the wrong metrics theyre looking at shortterm revenues and transaction costs The tradeoff using Coinbase app rather than selfcustody wallets is the ease of use being able to detect your bank account seamlessly and honestly the comfortability of a US company Its cool that they offer Web3 native features like decentralized app store or offer Coinbase wallet to access Uniswap and avoid using Coinbase platform Theyve 10x monthly transacting users vs where they were in 2018 Theyre leaning into straddling that line between CeFi and DeFi Bitwises Crypto Funds Bitwise is trying to build a product that serves a role for people who arent allin on crypto all the time Built the index diversified it and it rebalances every month There are 7 screens that they use and the biggest ones they have screened for are the assets that might have risks of being in violation of federal securities Spent a lot of time focusing on education and keeping updated over everything thats happening The broader financial industry is on adopting crypto Doing a lot of research on product and strategy in the space x200B Client Interest One thing thats been really true over the last 12 months is that the category is growing rapidly The biggest shift has been moving from BTC only to BTC and ETH Many financial advisors and family offices are more interested in ETH than in BTC Theres more interest in L2s and a fair amount of interest in DeFi Theres very little interest in NFTs Theres a little bit of a lag between what everyone is excited about in the crypto industry and where that excitement falls in the traditional mark x200B Custody Governance and Fund Allocation All of Bitwises assets are custodied by third party institutional qualified custodians The Bitwise 10 or BITW is in custody with Coinbase institutional the DeFi fund is custody with Anchorage and the Bitcoin fund is in custody by Fidelity They are a very conservative asset manager The partners that they use for custody have to be able to support participating in governance while still safely and securely storing those assets in cold storage x200B Multichain vs Cross chain future Users and capital dont really want to aggregate across a bunch of different L1s and app chains its not a great user experience seeing theres a lack of security in bridges and having to take on risk just slowly moving from blockchain to blockchain Ethereum would be the largest and they are definitely bullish on L2s and scaling solutions Cosmos is radically different and a completely different architecture It would be foolish not to diversify to some of these other interesting architectural approaches x200B Cryptos Next Big Unlock Its going to be a combination of 3 different things one is increases in regulation that makes it safer for people to mainstream into it second is throughput or cost of transactions and lastly new applications The preconditions today look better than they ever have in the history of crypto The expanse of the stablecoin ecosystem has gotten and how much liquidity there is in the stablecoin ecosystem across different stablecoins is really bullish for the space The most bullish for the next cycle are Dynamic NFTs because it takes the conversation away from price speculations and more about benefiting from the utility DeFi narrative DeFi applications are software but are like businesses in a way In order for them to continue growing they do need to generate some kind of clash flow Tokens embracing cash flow models are needed to get DeFi applications from a single use case or single protocol to multivertical businesses that are growing flourishing and sustainable x200B Check out

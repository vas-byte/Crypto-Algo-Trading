Is EOS EOSIO often referred to as EOS is a consensusdriven decentralized app dApp platform developed by blockone which uses EOS tokens to fund and facilitate various network operations It is essentially an operating system that runs apps on decentralized infrastructure which is distributed around the world The network utilizes distributed ledger technology blockchain in this case to store and confirm transactions and it executes smart contracts on its blockchain Its symbol on cryptocurrency exchange is EOS EOSIO is an opensource community project meaning that developers can submit improvement to the core developers blockone and is maintained by Blockone with the help of the opensource community via GitHub The EOSIO source code is released under an MIT license which means it can be modified and redistributed provided that the terms in the license are met EOSIO was first released on January 312018 and the official network main network was launched in June 2018 Cleos EOS COMMAND LINE UTILITY retrieving the content of block 034e67eb23 The EOS Token The EOS token is a digital currency that can be sent between EOS account holders to pay for the usage of RAM CPUs and the network EOS tokens can also be used for other things such as paying for goods or services for example a glazed donuts similarly to a fiat currency In contrast to fiat currency eg US Dollar EOS tokens are not represented by physical bank notes eg dollar bills and the price of EOS tokens is set by demand and supply Like fiat currencies EOS tokens are not backed by a physical commodity such as gold However EOS tokens distributions is handled differently from that of fiat currencies Fiat currencies are issued by central banks and the first EOS tokens were distributed via an ICO However inflation funds the EOS network by generating tokens to pay block producers discussed below among other things This is why EOS transactions are free The design of EOS was partially inspired by Bitcoin which also uses blockchain technology that produces blocks containing transactions signed with the senders private keys A key difference between EOS and Bitcoin is the consensus algorithm Bitcoin uses a ProofofWork PoW consensus algorithm while EOS uses a Byzantine FaultTolerant Delegated ProofofStake BFTDPoS algorithm The ProofofWork algorithm works by having miners solve blocks mine blocks in exchange for a reward Bitcoin which incentivize mining Mining is energyintensive due to high computational power requirements However it is a strong deterrent against excessive inflation The energy usage of mining is everincreasing due to its competitive nature leading to the pursuit of PoS alternatives such as EOS The EOS Initial Coin Offering ICO EOS tokens were distributed between June 2017 and June 2018 as part of Initial Coin Offering ICO held by blockone The ICO raised about 4hub billion dollars EOS TransfersStorage EOS tokens are stored in EOS account which are secured by two pairs of cryptographic keys each containing one an private key and one public key There is an owner key pair and an active key pair 4 keys in all The owner key pair and even the owner keys The active keys are used for daytoday activities such as staking voting and transferring tokens Your owner key should be locked away and only your active key should be imported into wallets The ability to change your EOS account keys is useful in the event that they are stolen While an EOS account has a private key for signing transactions as well as a public keys the public keys is not what you send your tokens to Its your account name which is a 12digit string a word or combination of letters and numerals ranging from 15 This means you can remember EOS account names instead of having to read through a long cryptographic key every time history instead of a hash To be fair you can create an address book in your Bitcoin wallet app and put your friends names in it How to Send Tokens You can send funds EOS tokens in this case to a friend via the following steps If you owe the person a certain amount in USD divide the USD amount by the USD price of EOS to determine how many EOS tokens that works out to Enter the number of tokens to send in your wallet app Enter the 12digit account name of the person you are sending the tokens to or scan their QR code usually by clicking scan click send Your friend should receive the tokens in a matter of seconds it has been averaging less than 2 second for me Your wallet app should have a transaction list containing the transaction ID You can copy and paste this ID in an EOS block explorer to confirm that the transaction has been sent Your wallet app may also just let you click the transaction and automatically bring it up for you in a block explorer for your convenience The transaction will become irreversible in a moment If your friend wants to refund you just have them follow the same process and just send the same amount back to your account EOS Basics Securing Your EOS wallet Two of the gravest threats to your walletaccount is the theft and loss of your EOS tokens You must ensure that your Never send anyone your wallet fileif any or private keys It is never necessary Never visit website that you dont trust or which are likely to contain malware Always make a copy of your wallet file or keys Backup to a secure location off your computer such as a USB thumb drive Ensure the backup drive above is never used for anything else or shared with anyone stow it away safely Dont use wallet apps that you havent researchedconfirmed to be trustworthy Dont store most of your tokens on exchanges Use a hardware or desktop wallet that gives you exclusive possession of your keys Activities on the EOSIO blockchain are action and there are different types of actions If you are sending fundsEOS tokens or tokens on the EOS network to someone that action is called a transfer Example pf actions on EOSIO include but are not limited to

retrieving the content of block 034e67eb23 The EOS Token The EOS token is a digital currency that can be sent between EOS account holders to pay for the usage of RAM CPUs and the network EOS tokens can also be used for other things such as paying for goods or services for example a glazed donuts similarly to a fiat currency In contrast to fiat currency eg US Dollar EOS tokens are not represented by physical bank notes eg dollar bills and the price of EOS tokens is set by demand and supply Like fiat currencies EOS tokens are not backed by a physical commodity such as gold However EOS tokens distributions is handled differently from that of fiat currencies Fiat currencies are issued by central banks and the first EOS tokens were distributed via an ICO However inflation funds the EOS network by generating tokens to pay block producers discussed below among other things This is why EOS transactions are free The design of EOS was partially inspired by Bitcoin which also uses blockchain technology that produces blocks containing transactions signed with the senders private keys A key difference between EOS and Bitcoin is the consensus algorithm Bitcoin uses a ProofofWork PoW consensus algorithm while EOS uses a Byzantine FaultTolerant Delegated ProofofStake BFTDPoS algorithm The ProofofWork algorithm works by having miners solve blocks mine blocks in exchange for a reward Bitcoin which incentivize mining Mining is energyintensive due to high computational power requirements However it is a strong deterrent against excessive inflation The energy usage of mining is everincreasing due to its competitive nature leading to the pursuit of PoS alternatives such as EOS The EOS Initial Coin Offering ICO EOS tokens were distributed between June 2017 and June 2018 as part of Initial Coin Offering ICO held by blockone The ICO raised about 4hub billion dollars EOS TransfersStorage EOS tokens are stored in EOS account which are secured by two pairs of cryptographic keys each containing one an private key and one public key There is an owner key pair and an active key pair 4 keys in all The owner key pair and even the owner keys The active keys are used for daytoday activities such as staking voting and transferring tokens Your owner key should be locked away and only your active key should be imported into wallets The ability to change your EOS account keys is useful in the event that they are stolen While an EOS account has a private key for signing transactions as well as a public keys the public keys is not what you send your tokens to Its your account name which is a 12digit string a word or combination of letters and numerals ranging from 15 This means you can remember EOS account names instead of having to read through a long cryptographic key every time history instead of a hash To be fair you can create an address book in your Bitcoin wallet app and put your friends names in it How to Send Tokens You can send funds EOS tokens in this case to a friend via the following steps If you owe the person a certain amount in USD divide the USD amount by the USD price of EOS to determine how many EOS tokens that works out to Enter the number of tokens to send in your wallet app Enter the 12digit account name of the person you are sending the tokens to or scan their QR code usually by clicking scan click send Your friend should receive the tokens in a matter of seconds it has been averaging less than 2 second for me Your wallet app should have a transaction list containing the transaction ID You can copy and paste this ID in an EOS block explorer to confirm that the transaction has been sent Your wallet app may also just let you click the transaction and automatically bring it up for you in a block explorer for your convenience The transaction will become irreversible in a moment If your friend wants to refund you just have them follow the same process and just send the same amount back to your account EOS Basics Securing Your EOS wallet EOS block are created by block producers BPs every 05 seconds At any given moment there are 21 block producers on EOS which generate 6 blocks each This means that 126 blocks are produced per round Block production is a fundamental part of how EOS works as transactions are placed in block producers Only one BP is authorized to produce a block in a 24hour period they are omitted from the block production process until they notify the EOS chain of their intention to continue block production voting for block producers On the EOS network it is EOS tokens holders that vote for block producers and the number of tokens they have staked is what determines the weight of their vote EOS also has a referendum system for users to vote on changes themselves making the EOS network democratic in nature An EOS block producers voting screen in a wallet app SimplEOS Image credit Kompulsa Staking EOS Tokens Some or all of an accounts EOS tokens can be staked by the owner and used to vote for block producers and for EOS referendums Staking is a 3days contract it takes 3 days to unstake EOS tokens that reserves a portion of the system resources on the EOS network for your account Such resources include NET bandwidth CPU bandwidth RAM on the other hand can be purchased using EOS tokens These resources are provided by block producers EOS Development EOSIO Smart Contracts An EOS smart contract is a digitallyenforced set of rules encoded on the blockchain that is autonomously enforced EOS dApps utilize smart contracts EOSIO smart contract are executed without having to pay or involve an intermediary As is the case with a traditional contract a smart contract may enforce penalties or carry out obligation encoded in the contract Therefore an EOS smart contract can do something automatically if certain conditions are met How does this differs from electronic services that already do all that without a blockchain or smart contracts For example A customers submitting an order in an online store and the stores software generates the invoice and shipping label automatically There are multiple reasons including security data loss transparency and realtime collaboration with businesses outside of your own Smart contracts are a fundamental part of how EOS works but most notably how dApps work on the EOS network EOS smart contracts or smart contracts on any other platform may also play a role in physical activities such as collaboration between logistics networks for examples Courier A may contract the services of courier B to pick up the slack if they dont have enough delivery vans a busy day if you will A rough example I made up is If a UPS package is delayed due to a lack of vans UPS could use a smart contact to instantly submit an order to whichever courier has the lowest bid posted on the blockchain to intercept that package and deliver it to the customers No human would ever have to place such an order themselves Doing this between only two couriers may not needs a blockchain but a bidding system involving many couriers calls for either a blockchain with smart contract or a potentially expensive intermediary Realword EOS Smart Contract Examples There are many dApps on the EOS network powered by smart contract and they include but are not limited to decentralized Exchange DEX Email dApps Social Networks more like twitter Instant Messaging dApps Job NetworkFreelancing Platforms Card Games Email dApps Dont be fooled by the term dApp An email dApp is just an email app that happens to run on a decentralized platform such as EOS or the email dApp could have its own platform One example of an email dApp with users is dmail Dmail is an encrypted email app that operates on the EOSIO blockchain Dmail is onchain email in that it operates on the EOS blockchain and your email address in this case is your EOS account name rather than something like usernamedmailcom This means that dmail addresses are significantly shorter than email addresses theyre only 12 digits However they are limited to the EOS blockchain at the time this article was written This means that you must have an EOS account in order to use dmail dmail uses MAIL tokens to disincentivize spam as sending a dmail will cost you a token dmail tokens were distributed for free to early adopters for free to get them started and 1000 tokens each is enough for them to email each other If someone replied to you on dmail you receive a tokens back from them so a backandfourth conversation with someone costs you nothing However if a spammer wants to send out 10000 emails They would need 10000 of the MAIL tokens which complicates matters for them Like other activities on the EOSIO blockchain dmails are sent it operates by sending tokens Decentralized Exchanges DEX A decentralized exchange DEX runs independently of a corporation However a corporation may be involved in the development or maintenance of its source code or binaries One example of a decentralized exchange running on the EOS blockchain is EOSDAQ You can submit an order to this DEX without having having to manually create an account and deposit funds and then submitting your order separately If using the exchange in an EOS wallet app such as EOS lynx you can do everything with a few clicks and an EOS smart contract will handle the orders execution For example You can swing by EOSDAQ without ever signing up for an account and submit an order immediately This is done using smart contracts If the order is fulfilled the EOSbased tokens you purchased will be sent to your wallet automatically You dont have to store any funds on a DEX at least not that one This is especially important considering that storing large portions of your funds on an exchanges is a dangerous practices even with twofactor authentication Using Blockchain To Build Trust with the help of immutability Despite not requiring identification which poses the risk of an unscrupulous account holder simply creating a new account if theyve been caught scamming someone An upcoming EOS account holder can build trust among other users whom have never even interacted with them by consistently staying true to their word How All of that accounts activity is on the EOSIO blockchain and can be proven by anyone by pulling up their account in an EOS block explorer They can even contract the account holders that interacted with them for feedback on what their experience with them was like One could also see if reputable account holders have been consistently interacting with the upcoming account This could server as a good sign that the upcoming account holder has integrity This could incentivize good people to stick with one account and build a reputation EOS Transaction CapacityEOS TPS Rating The transaction capacity of EOS typically measured in transactions per second tps is in the range of 3000 to just under 4000 tps As is the case with other platforms EOS has been receiving updates and may exceed that transaction capacity in the future EOS 20 has announced and is capable of reducing execution times significantly as well as improving the overall network performance of EOS thanks to the EOS VMJIT compiler EOS vs Layer 2 Scaling Solutions A key selling point of EOSIO is its scalability EOS is capable of achieving a throughout of thousands of transactions per second TPS Mined cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum typically achieve less than 15 TPS EOS uses rapid block production a proofofstake consensus algorithm and few block producers to achieve this high throughput and low latency Layer 2 Scaling solutions dont scale on the main chain as EOSIO does Some layers 2 solutions lock tokens on the main chain for example Ethereums blockchain and then settle transactions rapidly on their own side chains This is done using smart contracts Once these layer 2 solution have completed settlement they update the state of the main chain eventually Layer 2 scaling solutions usually use their own sidechain for settlement or state channels EOSIO has been touted as a possible scaling solution by its creators due to its high transaction capacity The lightning network uses state channels and is one of the most popular alternatives to EOS due to its impressively high transaction capacity One reason for layer 2 scaling solutions is to help existing blockchain without modifying their own consensus algorithms

20220520 Author_Comments The latest CD meetings been setting the tone for much of discussions in the Eden Member group The quality or rather lack thereof in some EOSIO BPs and the voting for BPs became main topics through this week This recap just a very tiny fraction of the rich and deep discussions EOSIO_EOS_future M1 I think it would be awesome for either Eden or the ENF to establish a fund for attracting projects from other chains and facilitate porting over or them being multichain especially once the EVM is up and running A Committee could be created by interested Eden Members and work with Eden Funding or apply to the ENF for funding from them M2 To attract other chain Dapp developers we need to have a large user base to get that we need just 1 killer Dapp whos building it Easy onboarding free to use M1 I take your point though that some Dapp Developers depending on what theyre building will be looking to come on board an ecosystem with users If thats the case this is where we need to sweeten the pottemporarily subsidize them to use the EVM and discover the benefits of utilizing EOS first This can grow our usersonchain transactions and can save them some cash at first and jumpstart the network effect Eden_future referencing EdenOnEOS Chief Delegate Meeting 5 Sat May 14 2022 This weeks Chief Delegate meeting is not one to miss There is a bold vision being formed and the EOS community is likely to have an opinion Lets see what the makes of the CDs latest democratic overtures eos ENF_Eden M1 ENF serves the network and the network needs to be optimized M2 if members who want to run organizations and initiatives want to do so to better the network then they should go for it M1 ENF can also delegate voting to Eden andor to a proxy M2 we are about to destroy EOS M3 ENF may of course vote with their own tokens nothing wrong there If BPs want money to run infra they could pitch to ENF to get some funding but I dont see why ENF would proactively go looking for BP candidates to fund M1 ENF is currently our best bet for cutting the deadweight BPs M2 they are they are really doing a great job M3 Its a difficult question as these are tokens being allocated to the ENF by the network Conflicts of interest arise What if the current BPs asked that IF the ENF votes its only allowed to vote for the current top 21 giving way to further centralization M1 If EOS doesnt prioritize having amazing above and beyond BPs then it will likely be outcompeted by networks who do prioritize it And rightfully so Id like to see where seriously addressing this BP thing is on the collective roadmap for the EOS network Eden_Proxy M1 Quick question if we have 181815 EOS in the Eden Treasury why is it the Eden Proxies only have 66000 votes Before discussing the ENF voting with their tokens shouldnt this be taken care of first M2 Eden Treasury doesnt vote for Eden Proxy M1 Shouldnt it M2 It was suggested in the CD meeting To send a signal M1 Hard to discuss whether the ENF should or could do anything in regards to voting if we havent done it ourselves CD1 Edens elected leadership dont have the active keys for the genesiseden account yet M1 Im for making bold moves in both the governance and finances of the network We all know what needs to be done the question is whether or not we have the power and will to do it I applaud Yves for having taken the initiative in both and working within the confines of the system as is and blazing a trail forward where no one new how CD1 Maybe many of the paid BPs look around and see the ones doing nothing and want to change things but they cant They would be waiting for an organization like EDEN to come along demonstrate that it understands what is happening and maybe those BPs would be amenable to giving this organization some voting weight to attempt to address the problem EdenOnEOS CD1 The transparency projects that many have been speaking of and hoping for and building piecemeal those projects can become a core mission of Eden Chain Transparency If Eden wanted to it could replicate our process and any other cool apps that were going to be creating and bundle them into a dapp that others can use At the moment though others cant just use Eden without a great deal of wasted energy M1 So genesis eden might have to polish edenOS for the best of what genesis eden wants to do CD1 Sure get the contracts and interfaces built so that others can use them M1 this brings up the point that the most important thing is the eden process The edenOS code can be rewritten but the concept of electing people to distribute funds or build a community throught consensus is the gem perhaps CD1 Yeah finding that gem has been difficult I think its the political playoffs process itself It seems to work but only when there is a sufficiently largediverse group of people playing the game Sybil M1 Annual dues and intro meetings are both imperfect sybil resistance not sybil proof The election is theoretically sybil proof although I look forward to analyzing an attempted attack at some point But its also not a big deal to allow sybil attacks if there are no positive rights given to the community at large and all benefits are a function of ones participation in elections M2 Maybe at some point Eden should run a test election where it provides a bounty for whitehat sybil attackers who reveal shortcomings and suggest solutions We are in the era of deep fakes now M3 the bounties often stimulate putting fakes in they again incentivise attackers to collect them because price of putting them there and pointing to them is far smaller than researching where the real attackers at M4 Then we may just need some sort of system that rewards or tracks reputation Where when someone is caught doing something shady they have something to lose Chief_Delegatesmeet 1 Apologies for the delay Heres the meeting notes from the most recent CD meeting Chief_Delegatesmeet 2 EdenOnEOS Chief Delegate

rebranding the main net There is a cooperative between EOS chains there is good governance happening at EDEN and the fractally white paper is being coded into a very exciting Blockchain application EOS is evolving into a federation of DOAs Smart Companies and DACs which separately and together are coding Open Source software solutions that are a strong foundation for public goods In addition for profit businesses are attracting VC funding to build on top of these blockchain and open source solutions Fractally_related Eden connected Proposal for Eden Fractal Im proposing the name Empowering Eden Contributors for this event We are also looking to schedule another weekly meeting on another day of the week Proposal for Fractal Forums Im proposing the name Moving Eden Forward for this event If the group is open to it we may join on StreamYard to have the meeting there as part of the live stream event rather than on Zoom as we normally do Not sure the level of interest yet Im just a facilitator My suggestion for the Live Stream event is to theme it around these questions or something similar to spark convo and valuable contentWhat has been your greatest recent contribution to the EOS networkWhats something valuable that youd like to see happen next on EOS DAOs_Legal_Wrapper New paper on legal wrapping for DAOs Read and discussFrom Finally it is helpful to keep in mind that legal and operational timelines can vary considerably In many instances DAOs develop organically before their legal wrappers DAOs can begin with a catalyst organizing a small community with a particular mission or goal At the beginning stages members coalesce around communication platforms like Discord and As the DAO grows members may but certainly not always choose to launch a token and potentially raise capital for the DAOs treasury by having members contribute assets DAOs commonly also leverage blockchain technology to implement governance over the DAO a process that can involve using any number of opensource tools and dapps that have preset and customizable organizational structures or protocols DAOs operating in this model tend to start small and legal wrappers are often only considered as DAOs scaleor after they run into trouble due to a hack or operational problems that create liability ENF_Eden related to DAOs_Legal_Wrapper words from Yves La Rose Please dont make Eden a formal legal entity Please keep that out of bylaws Please keep Eden as a smart contract operated DAO CDs can form an entity to interact with the real world if they wish thats not Eden I will not support and would campaign against getting Eden to be a formal entity Please dont transform Eden itself into a formal legal entity I am not neutral on Edens future I wish to see it succeed and fill a key role Grow your membership Become a nonarguable weight within the ecosystem DAOs_Legal_Wrapper M1 Uniqueness is attractive We dont all have to agree on the definition of DAO Its a logical process set in motion by people And we have to tend to it carefully like one does any garden Gardens are themselves like systems of smart contracts with various yields from unique processesEdens main strength is that it is a collection of real people from around the world who are not worried about fitting into a single set of regional laws Were trying to build something that is supranational If individuals wish to create a legal wrapper for a specific purpose its something that they can do But they cant speak for the whole organization without basically inviting an enemy to come and set up in our garden permanently M2 The amount of time and energy on the idea of Eden on EOS being turned into or using a company M3 From my perspective on what a DAO is which is the only direction in which I personally support Eden progressing Edens next step doesnt even make grammatical sense Eden doesnt take steps Members take steps I member wants to form a legal entity he should do so Members can do things and we are all using the fractal governance process to organize our efforts toward a common goal Im starting to prefer thinking that what we are doing is DAO We are exhibiting decentralized autonomous organization rather than being a decentralized autonomous organization which apparently implies to most people a form of topdown organization that I think isnt super compatible with fractal gov M1 We have to think about what Eden can be in 35710 years When you really step back and consider the potential we are on the bleeding edge of DAO technology and techniques This is much more than just a process EdenOnEOS M1 Establish a purpose and have people vote in line with what the objective is I agree if someone feels that a Delegates project is inline with the overall objective and values that in his group more than the consensus builder who cant get the guy with the project to back down I dont see how you can control for this Other than stating somewhere that elections are to select for consensus builders able to establish consensus amongst their peers and provide the most value to their organization in our case EOS M2 Im fully in agreement that this Eden org needs more direction and clarity as to our purpose through clear objectives and measurable KPI M3 I think the objective that we should aim to achieve is simply to help Eden It doesnt really matter if someone is building a project or just aiming to lead Eden The only voting criteria should be how much each person helps Eden The Eden process takes care of the rest by enabling each community member to express their opinions about who or what is most helpful for Eden M4 I wholeheartedly disagree with the faith in actors I generally feel here Were not building Eden for UsEOS Were building it for everyone If we cant reach consensus on what is True North all other consensus is worthless M3 Why would it matter whether someone is building a project or just leading I dont see any reason to make a distinction about leaders or projects in the bylaws People can help however they want and voters decide whats most helpful M5 This group was founded by a bunch of key people in the EOS community and then it was funded by the Block Producers many of which are counted among Edens members They did this with the knowledge that Eden members had already spoken about working towards improving Delegated Proof of Stake of working to build a human element that could help enhance the cold logic of DPoS consensus This network is on the cusp of spectacular success and I am confident that it will handle it well because it has already proven how well it can handle failure and disappointment If there is a crisis that Eden can address though it is getting this decentralized organization ready to actually matter to people when EOS starts to really take off EdenOnEOS offered to Eden CDs Yo Im not paying attention much so any of the CDs who want total ownership control of the EdenOnEOS channel just give me a shout and Ill change the ownership to whomever you want it changed to Chief_Delegatesmeet In lieu of recording yet from CD meeting 7 planned for end last week I here link to where previous meetings are found Well worth another look at to remind where we are and aim toward when and if time allow END

on Cypto Project Teams and Communities Episode 2 An Overview of 3 Major Crypto Bubbles During 20142022 Part 2 ICO Bubble The bleak 2018 crypto market is probably the epitome of ICO bubble bursts The ICO boom reminds me of Edward Chancellors book A History of Financial Speculation which describes the tulip bubble and the collapse of Kamikaze Capitalism if someone hope to continue the book the dotcom bubble and the ICO bubble in my opinion could be a wonderful chapter too I am deeply impressed by the endless plunge of the 2018 crypto market With the hype of BTC and ETH cryptocurrencies gained seemingly unstoppable momentum numerous investors flocked in pushing the token price higher and higher An increasing number of investors were expecting lucrative profits around the New Year not realizing the approaching of an epic burst of bubble at all What is an ICO ICO Initial Coin Offering is the cryptocurrency industrys way to raise fund by initially offering reasonablyevaluated new coins on a blockchainbased platform ICO used to be an exclusive game for technical gurus in the early days However with the launch of ERC 20 token standard token maps team value or stands for a proof of stake in November 2015 Ethereum becomes an Androidlike open source platform that allows everyone to develop Ethereumbased token Token that meets the standard can be sold publicly and automatically to raise fund without thirdparty supervision providing convenient ICO access to those who have little technical knowledge With ETH lowering the entry barrier for ICO the exponentially increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies brings in huge amount of speculative fund Being hyped as the next Internet opportunity the market value of ETH and ETHrelated coins started to soar Bitcoin price increased 10x in one year from early 2017 to February 2018 ETH made an over 100x price rise in 2017 from 798 on January 1 2017 to over 800 in December 2017 and reached a high of 1432 in January 2018 The skyrocketing token price brings considerable profit to ICO teams With nearzero tokenissuing cost ICO teams get tens of millions of investment within seconds with a whitepaper and a business model making ICO a wellknown shortcut to wealth For example Blockones yearlong ICO enabled EOS to raise nearly 44 billion RSK ICP BLZ and OXT easily raised hundreds of millions of dollars in a few minutes which was quite normal in crypto space at that time After realizing hosting ICO has much higher profit than participating and can be as easy as telling stories more and more projects were launched with unreasonable overvaluation Just like commodity bubbles ICO bubble stimulates utilizes and is fueled by humans greed and desire until goes insane at last When the capital inflow failed to keep up with the fundraising scale the price of ETH and BTC stopped soaring wildly People began to come out from the euphoria some realized the price was on the brink but most cryptoers were still expecting a higher one However the decline of ETH and BTC price did not affect the ICO market immediately Some people took it as a regulatory pullback like the one happened in September 2017 they thought the price would recover soon because everyone said the blockchain was the future and everyone had a fear of missing out this express train to the future Since most ICO project teams also hold tokens as reserve fund ICOcompleted projects did not take the February 2018 price fluctuations seriously due to the consensus that cryptocurrency has high volatility How to deal with the insufficient capital inflow Project teams rose token price by using ETH to attract retail investors and then sold token to investors for stablecoins like USDT making BTC and ETH supportless The ICO entrustment scam Entrustee returns fund to entruster if the invested token price rises and sends tokens which are bought from 2nd market to entrustee if token price declines and the unprofitable ICOs triggered the market plummet BTC and ETH lost 70 of its peak market value after three waves in 6 months As a result many wellfundraised public chain projects that were launched in late 2018 joined the stampede sequence after unlocking the fund hundreds of project teams did rugpull or lost contact At that time there was no cryptocurrency ETF like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC nor institutional arbitrage in the market The ICO bubble bursted in the form of the rugpull of project team or entrusted agent It was as simple as that of the tulip bubble all tokens turned out to be air once the ICO package was tore off The Demise of Decentralized Capitalism We are experiencing the gradual cognitive breakdown of the cryptocurrency industry which can be summarized as the demise of decentralized capitalism from Luna and 3AC collapse Most public chain and stablecoin projects entered the market with vast sums of lowinterest capital under the name of decentralization But once they knew how to print money by themselves they became primitive people who held fire and pushed token price higher and higher When they felt they were very close to the holy Mt Olympus of the crypto space the flames suddenly burned out a torrential rain destroyed their fire and leverage In the current cryptocurrency market the hot sale of art NFT is reminiscent of the Dutch tulip speculation in the 1630s Just as the financial revolution sparked the speculative frenzy of 1690 and the collapse of the Blington Woods system triggered the modern financial revolution like stablecoin depegging and led to the bubble economy of the 1980s economic loosening process can give rise to speculative frenzy easily The constantly financing and varying DeFi products remind me of the South Sea Bubble in 1720 As long as the capital market is relatively free fanaticism and infectiousness wont have any trouble moving around while altcoins will make everyone homeless Conclusion Every bubble burst is cruel and despairing but accompanied by value discovery While the first bubble confirmed the unsubstitutability of BTC technology the second made ETH and more blockchain applications widely known the third bubble enabled us to realize the feasibility of combining decentralized finance and centralized finance Invest calmly and plan reasonably to go through the bull and bear market follow 4billionDAO to know more crypto

TrustSwapfinance and what is DEFI 30 Lets start with what the swap market is today one of the most popular Swaps today is Uniswap a decentralized smart contract that runs on Ethereum and other chains and then there is Sushiswap also and Pancakeswap these last two are forks or clones of Uniswap and they made a few changes to the economics of Uniswap mainly a unlimited inflation on their governance token And there are lots of other forks of this smart contracts mainly of Sushiswap and Pancake swap that is all these projects have unlimited inflation on their governance token And its token value it all comes from governance there is no other use of their beyond that After discovering Trust EVM and seeing how well organized the community behind EOS was I said ok we have to go beyond the tests that we were doing and bring something that leverages all these amazing tools And a Swap is the tool that made the most sense So we said ok lets bring a swap but lets not fork Sushiswap or Pancakeswap lets fork Uniswap and keep the same limited inflation economics And then lets bring in something great from Sushiswap and Pancakeswap that is give our governance token away in exchange for users adding liquidity And so we have this idea of distributing our tokens to those providing liquidity but with the big difference that unlike Sushiswap and Pancakeswap there is a hard limit on the number of tokens from day 1 And that is all working TODAY on the Trust EVM testnet as we eagerly await for mainnet launch And then we shared these ideas inside the community everyone was very welcoming we got feedback on the token and a challenge So we have this token at the center of TrustSwap incentive model but we need to find ways to give it value beyond governance beyond what Uniswap Sushiswap and Pancakeswap are doing Take things a step further forward And we discussed a few ideas some of them contentious And then we hear about these two amazing papers that change everything the Yield and Recover papers and we saw how they fit right into our plans I dont want to give too many details so this doesnt get that long But basically EOS Yield project means that we are able to create a sustainable yield for our token beyond governance While other projects are looking for solutions to a death spiral caused by inflation we have one ready We are certain that we can leverage the Yield incentives in such a way that we can create a token that continues to increases in value being scarce and being useful Sustainable growth It is worth repeating DEFI 30 means we are a step ahead of everyone else And then we have Recover and this is yet another great incentive for users to prefer trading with us because we can offer trading with less risk Again I dont want to go into details but if you havent read check the papers and they contain lots of valuable information and will give you a clear idea of what we are building And so we can finally answer what TrustSwapfinance is TrustSwap is the DEFI 30 exchange for the next Billion of users result of a series of incentives of our underlying platforms Big plans right and this also means that while we are being bootstrapped by leveraging the EOS ecosystem tools our plans go further We aim to grow to the point where we become a reason for users that are outside of the ecosystem to join We are still in the early days in the 90s of the Internet if you will Before Billions of people had the internet in their pocket And then there is this big switch of people using centralized exchanges into decentralized finance and so we are a door to DEFI 30 on EOS People that are moving from centralized exchanges they dont care about what type of server the service is running right They dont care if the servers run Windows or Linux what they care about is their funds being safe the fees being low having enough liquidity good pairing of tokens and also the information necessary to find the good tokens to find the token that is about to go up 10x and 100X and that is some of the things we want to answer in our project And so that is what we are building we are leveraging all these tools Trust EVM Yield Recover to create a platform that gets the attention of everyone those moving away from centralized exchanges And so we are in the early days of crypto and the early days of DEFI yet we are already one step ahead of what other decentralized services are offering We are taking this step by step we have a working system on testnet and preparing things for mainnet We want to have solved our contract security and for this we have security audits on the way The ENF is helping us and that is a great incentive that motivate us to move forward and put all this energy into but we also need help from the community our Pomelo is active now and we are looking to get funds to cover our security contract audits and so here is a call for your support We really want to build and have a positive impact on the ecosystem and so we cant do this alone we need the community support to achieve these goals You can join our TG here You can support us on Pomelo here

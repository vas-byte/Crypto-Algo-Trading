The proposals set forth by the API+ working group will create the roadmap for how the EOS network goes about improving existing API services as well as how to approach even larger challenges such as next generation chain API specifications and the future of history solutions.

Following the blue paper‚Äôs publication, the EOS community will have the opportunity to review and discuss the materials to help determine where to prioritize funding to execute on the needs outlined by the API+ working group.

I recently discovered a project with great potential, Organix -- Synthetic Asset Exchange. Here are some of my thoughts:

OGX is a counterproject to SNX with high innovation value. SNX is nearly two years, and its valuation rose about 50 times at its peak. It can be inferred that this is a very promising track. But as anyone who has tried SNX can tell, it has some problems: it is based on the underlying layer of Ethereum, that is slow and expensive, and the interactive experience of the product is unfriendly to general users. There is no real application product ecology. On the other hand, OGX is based on BSC and EOS, which can fix the issue of slow speed and high cost. Meanwhile, the product development and operation ability of the project team can ensure the product launch and subsequent iterations.

Next, OGX is a DEX. At present, most of DEX are based on the mode of Uniswap, so Uniswap occupies about 60% of the market share, and it may be higher further. This is the Metcalfe‚Äòs law of the Internet, the strong will always be strong. But Uniswap's problem is the depth of the trade, along with slippage. OGX's model does not exist slippage.

In the future, OGX will be built along the direction of greater trade depth (no slippage), wide variety of trade categories (not only digital currency but also all valuable assets), good product experience and beneficial to the community. These are the core values of OGX as an exchange. OGX is still growing currentlyÔºåwhile many people have not understood it yet. We shall deliver the value in advance and wait for the subsequent outbreak!

We often hear and talk about community in blockchain, but how to define it? There is one big difference on the underlying logic of blockchain and the Internet or traditional commerce: openness. The openness of traditional business gradually shrinks during the establishment process. For example, it is difficult and expensive for us to obtain the resource of Facebook and Twitter today. The blockchain is built on the basis of increasing openness. Only with greater openness can we feel more secure to build an ecosystem. The essence of OGX is to form the most open trading platform or protocol, therefore, the community can participate in the issuance, circulation and pricing of assets.

For community capital, participation in promotion will reap:

1. OGX, as an exchange, will generate a steady stream of cash flow from fees income, once it gets big.

2. OGX mining release speed is fast;

3. All trading items on OGX are assets synthesized by the community through OGX. Once the scale and application scenarios of the synthesized assets such as OBTC exceed the scale of the original BTC, the community capital has the pricing power. (The current competitive nature of DEFI is the competitive pricing power);

4. Develop more play than SNX, such as leveraged trading.

Starting from the BSC and EOS communities, OGX will form its own independent ecosystem in the future. Empowered by the cross-chain ecosystem, OGX will become the most open platform throughout the digital world.

If you would like to know more, please join in the official OGX community:

Ethereum version 2.0, from what I‚Äôve seen, is gaining a lot of attention. I see lots of articles regarding ‚ÄòLayer 2‚Äô platforms and ‚ÄòzSNARKS‚Äô which claim they can scale/are beginning to scale the Ethereum network at an incredible rate. 

Im curious to see an objective look at both platforms and how they stack up against each other. Its my understanding that from a technical standpoint EOS blows ETH out of the water. It‚Äôs also obvious Ethereum appears to be the preferred blockchain because of security and decentralisation despite the slow network. If the version 2.0 network delivers on its promises then it‚Äôs going to take a lot, not just for EOS but for all blockchains, to compete with Ethereum, right?

I was wondering if it's possible to automate dapps using web scrapers, like puppeteer. I intend to automate DefiBox, what I plan to do is: login once a day, deposit X $BOX tokens into 360 stake, and claim. After 360 days, keep staking X $BOX into 360, and the rest would be put into EOS (newdex pool, or pETH into DefiBox lend pol).

I automated bunch of tasks using puppeteer but with EOSIO dapps is a little different because I need to click anchor to sign the TX as well, and I can't do that through puppeteer.

My question is, has anybody been doing similar stuff and could you guys recommend what  I should do? I could do all this manually but... yeah :D

Thanks!","self","https://redd.it/s4itr6"

In the report, WebX Labs reviewed the EOS Network Foundation negotiating with Block.one and finally stopped releasing tokens to Block.one.

The article emphasizes: The EOS community hopes to leave Block.one and develop independently. After this incident, EOS has become a DAO in the true sense.

In the report, WebX Labs also mentioned the six core working groups established by the EOS Network Foundation, and introduced high-quality projects in the EOS ecosystem. WebX Labs is looking forward to the development of EOS DAO in 2022.","self","https://redd.it/s6am3r"

4 billion dollar from ICO, and EOS hasnt deliver anything

EOS name already has a bad reputation and I don't believe in EOS anymore, as EOS let down so many investors but Telos has risen from the grassroots, Telos hasn't raised ICO money, so Telos is honest project

but EOS's blockchain technology is still superior, and Telos use this superior EOS blockchain technology

I think that Telos is going to be exactly what EOS was supposed to be at its best

Telos price a year ago was $ 0.03, and today Telos price is $ 0.64, so very good price action, and Telos

total supply is pretty low, same total supply coin like Solana

But thanks to EOS creator Dan Larimer, without EOS there would be no Telos

Once again, I believe Telos will be the success story that EOS was supposed to be","self","https://redd.it/s95z03"

# Introducing the Audit+ Blue Paper

Authors: Sentnl and Slowmist

&#x200B;

**Abstract**

In this paper we provide our research and initiatives around improving the overall security of EOSIO blockchains.

Our research shows that very few solutions exist in the EOSIO geared towards security. The EOSIO core system is beautifully designed to allow for a security oriented approach, but there is much work required to bring it up to the same standard of security that other blockchains offer.

A key area that resides in this paper is knowledge. The self perpetuating knowledge within developer communities which can only be achieved by giving them the right tools and documentation.

The huge security knowledge of the hacker communities and their inquisitive nature that we should harness to continuously secure EOSIO.

The knowledge of our userbase knowing that their interactions with EOSIO dApps are safe and secure, which is possible to achieve due to EOSIO‚Äôs unique structure as long as we provide the underlying  services and APIs.

As mentioned, the overall core design of EOSIO allows for a security oriented approach, we just need to focus on the basics and then go a step further, by harnessing some key EOSIO elements that will help us stand out from other blockchains.

**SocialGood** is an application that offers cashback for your purchases, however, the refund is paid in its own token: *SocialGood (SG)*.

They are currently running a **$200 limited-time promotion** (still active through March 2): -They have increased their bonus to $200; To claim this, you must register with a link and make a purchase of at least $30 (\~‚Ç¨27) within 30 days of registering. The purchase can be in any currency.

&#x200B;

STEPS TO FOLLOW:

**1.** Sign up through my link ([https://socialgood.inc/?id=CPNNKN](https://socialgood.inc/?id=CPNNKN)) and make sure the code **CPNNKN** is pre-filled during registration.

**2.** Once you have registered, you will see the $200 registration bonus as 'pending' in your purchase history.

**3.** To activate the bonus, make a purchase of at least $30 in any of the stores that offer the application. Shipping costs and taxes do not count. So I advise that you spend a little bit more than $30 to make sure it works. I also recommend you buy something from AliExpress since it's 100% cashback. Therefore, you aren't really spending $30 and getting the item for free.

**4.** Your purchase will appear as 'pending' in your purchase history in a few days, it took me about 36 hours to appear in the history.

**5.** Once your purchase is approved, your $200 signup bonus will also be approved automatically. (As with other cash back sites, the approval process can take about a month, depending on the store; this is to make sure you haven't returned your items.)

**6.** You can then withdraw your SocialGood tokens for free to your wallet (like Metamask for example). Also note that the refund is given in cryptocurrencies, so the amount you get back may fluctuate in value before the refund is approved.

&#x200B;

Just let you know that this shit really works. If you have any doubts just write to me and I will be pleased to answer all your questions. I did this a few days ago and I got $300 since the SG went up a lot.","self","https://redd.it/sljm82"

DeFi seeks to develop traditional financial products, but with a higher degree of transparency and decentralization. These products are like lego bricks and can be combined with each other to develop an entire ecosystem of solutions that together form a great financial solution, making centralized and opaque financial institutions obsolete.

This is the idea that drove the term ‚ÄúDeFi‚Äù and the idea that led to its evolution to what it is today. In fact, it is impossible to ignore the huge impact of DeFi on the world of cryptocurrencies right now. For this reason, we have opened a space to understand what DeFi is and how this idea can change the world of finance.

## Why EOS?

The main reason to talk about Decentralized Finance on EOS is because of its technology. The EOS blockchain is capable of processing thousands and even tens of thousands of transactions per second, while other networks suffer from congestion with a maximum of 15 transactions per second.

Another fundamental and very prominent reason is that Dapps that are developed on EOS provide the user with free transactions. Compared to other networks where users pay high fees to transact, users on EOS do not have to pay network fees and in the case they do, the network fees are very close to 0.

The Token Sale Smart Contract enables projects to crowdsource through a token sale, configuring different parameters like whitelisting requirements and token vesting.

The teams of EOSTARTER and EOS Costa Rica have started working on the [Platform Application](https://github.com/eostarter/token-sale-platform) and the [Platform‚Äôs smart contract](https://github.com/eostarter/eostarter.sale-smart-contract) open-source GitHub repositories. The Token Sale Platform offers a suite of services for investors and project owners seeking funding. Project owners will set up a token sale pool, configure the parameters, and launch a public token sale. Upon EOSTARTER‚Äôs approval, the token sale will begin on the established sale date and vest accordingly for investors and project owners.

However, it seems that not everyone is in agreement on whether this would be a good move by the ENF, especially at this point in time where EOS is on a strong rebuilding phase. But then again this ‚Äúrebuilding phase‚Äù could be the perfect time to do this.

*An Italian version of this article is available at the bottom.*

LONDON (Bywire News) - According to many people, 2022, as well as seeing real growth in the NFT infrastructure, will also be big for DAOs. As a result, there will be the birth of various DAOs and tokens linked to them which, in theory, will offer real profits for many people ‚Äì especially the creators of the DAOs themselves.

But before delving into this sector, we must try to understand what these DAOs are. To do that we have to first answer the question of what is the largest DAO in the world. We can do so by examining some of the fundamental parameters of DAOs.

The EOS network has not had a major upgrade since the release of EOSIO 2.0 over two years ago. Since that time block.one has produced EOSIO 2.1 and a release candidate for EOSIO 2.2; however, for various reasons the Clarionos team and the broader EOS community do not want all of the code bundled with the more recent releases.

Going forward, the Clarionos team will fork the EOSIO code repository into a new codebase which we have dubbed Mandel (short for Mandelbrot). The Mandel name is a placeholder until a broader consensus among all EOSIO powered blockchains can be reached.

The first version of Mandel will be 3.0 and will be derived from EOSIO 2.0 while cherry-picking some of the most valuable enhancements from EOSIO 2.1 and a few from EOSIO 2.2. Mandel 3.0 will also introduce two new hard-forks: Contract Pays, Enhanced Configurable Blockchain Params. Furthermore, it will cherry-pick the Configurable WASM Limits hard-fork from EOSIO 2.1.

 At the end of last week, La Rose announced their decision in a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/BigBeardSamurai/status/1491758599395180548?s=20&t=qlkRpj3ZorGEV7imyS6rbg). Few actual details of what the legal action might entail have emerged but what we do know is that they have commissioned a top Canadian law firm to look at all viable legal options. There has been no confirmation of which firm they have employed, however, Bywire can exclusively reveal that we believe the law firm in question is a top law firm that shares the same registered corporate address as the ENF. The ENF is located at 9th Avenue Calgary, as is [Miller Thomson](https://www.millerthomson.com/en/). Self-described as ‚ÄòCanada‚Äôs Law Firm‚Äô, they have vast experience in corporate law with twelve branches throughout Canada. Additionally, the firm was given the go ahead by Nova Scotia's supreme court to represent the 115,000 former customers of QuadrigaCX exchange, who are seeking to recoup the [$196 million the exchange owes them](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/19/judge-appoints-law-firms-to-represent-quadrigacx-customers/). When approached for comment and confirmation, the ENF did not deny that this is the firm they have engaged.

Then earn even more free Crypto AND NFT PACKS for a limited time playing Wombat Dungeon Master with Wombat Wallet!!!!! (Also a great R-Planet wallet option. Free daily transactions with no staking required)","EOS NFT's",1.0,1,0,0,0,0,"So quite a dirty little post (okay after typing it I ended up not being so quick and dirty but extremely detailed but beneficial) about one of my daily apps I love. Womplay.Io, through Wombat Wallet app.

With Womplay, you can earn ‚ÄúWombat‚Äù every single day by installing various blockchain based games and then you earn even more by playing each day AND completing daily in game challenges.

Some of these apps even offer challenges to win free nft drops. I have collected around 35 NFT‚Äôs for free from them. And some rare ones do drop. At first they were worth pennies. I figured it was a waste of time. Well six months later I checked one of my Epics I got from Hero Zero and it was worth $15 bucks. Went from .20 to $15!!!
THEN!!!! Once you earn some NFT‚Äôs, you can use the browser tab of Wombat Wallet app to play the browser game by the very same developers/creators of Wombat wallet and Womplay.io..... their new Defi based NFT staking game, Wombat Dungeon Master.


In Dungeon Master, you stake NFT‚Äôs from EOS AND WAX, then send your ‚Äúwombat‚Äù into the dungeon to collect those NFT‚Äôs. When the wombat returns, you collect reward points towards a once per 24 hrs Treasure Chest reward. 

Depending on how many reward points you earn per day, you collect varying amounts of Season Reward Points and then every once in awhile, you find a pack of Dungeon Master NFT tools to equip on your wombat for various boosts/bonuses. 

The minimum drop rate of these packs are around 20%. So once in every five days, minimum. I have spent about 9 days in this season (they just started season 1) and I have already gotten 4 packs. Three standard packs with two NFT‚Äôs, (5 commons, one being a level 2 common and one legendary) and one ‚Äúsilver pack‚Äù with three NFT‚Äôs with increased odds or rarer NFT‚Äôs.


At the end of the each season in Wombat Dungeon Master, you turn in your reward points and are paid out at a minimum $1 of eos for every 100,000 points earned.

I currently earn 185,000 points per day on average. So roughly 1.85 per day at minimum. It could be more depending on the size of the reward points pool at seasons end.

Couple that with the free nft drops (each standard tool nft pack currently sells for $4-$5 per pack right now on Atomic Hub) I am looking at around $3 per day earned using just this game. (Note I use a hack/trick/work around in the game that increases my rewards by 6.5x times.... continue reading below to see how to get that chest from me)


Just doing all the above steps I have already earned an estimated $35 in around 10 days... not shabby for something free.

Click the referral link below to download wombat wallet app for android or iPhone (doing this helps me out with free actions each day within wombat wallet for several chains including free cpu, ram and net onto op of the free resources that wombat already provides everyone using their app). Doing this gets you more free resources as well upon app download and setup.

Then, click the second referral link below to sign up for womplay.io to begin earning crypto and NFT‚Äôs for free within the wombat wallet app. (Doing so helps me by completing challenges for rewards and also a boost in reward points earned) also doing this gets you a reward point sign up bonus

Sadly there is currently no referral for Wombat Dungeon Master so no sign up bonuses. BUT!!! If you comment below once you have finished signing up for both prior apps/accounts through my provided referral links, and comment telling me so, and my referral count confirms you signed up, I‚Äôll DM you with a neat, free, simply hack//trick to boost your earnings in Wombat Dumgeon Master by 6.5x times and also greatly increase your odds to also earn a free nft pack of tools for the game along with your increased reward points.

Enjoy everyone! And thanks for reading and helping me grow this economy!




1.) -Wombat Wallet Referral Link
I am using Wombat to play my favorite blockchain games. Join me and get a handful of free transactions by entering the code ""Y76KHA"" after signing up here https://getwombat.page.link/welcome.

2.) -Womplay.io Referral Link https://womplay.io/?ref=DM3ETB6[Womplay.io Referral Link](https://womplay.io/?ref=DM3ETB6)





PS!!!!!!!!!!!! Also, wombat wallet is great for playing R-Planet. Just use the browser/explore tab. (You get twenty free actions per day with the app. No need to stake Wax. If you pay $1.99 per month, you get 200 free actions per day. Perfect for a game like r planet where you usually have to stake like $60 of wax in cpu to make enough transactions per day)
Also if you pay $.99 you can unlock your private keys to transfer wallet somewhere else","self","https://redd.it/swr1tq"

Each of us is better off when we can collaborate for mutual benefit. Collaboration is not a zero-sum game because the value of the whole can be greater than the sum of the individual contributions.

Pierre has his own farm and self- market where people can come in and buy fruits and vegetables in a self-serving manner. People can pay using Crypto and cash. They use mostly EOS as a currency because of its speed and low cost and high liquidity. More than a dozen distributors already accept crypto. Local meetups can have a long indirect impact as you can see, have you thought about starting your own or joining one? ü§ì 

Pierre has a bachelor's degree in computer science from Laval U and a master's degree at MIT. He also studied social and economic transformation and worked on implementing ERP solutions in businesses and was a consultant in change management. He was a consultant for collectivity development and has built 2 coops and 1 not-for-profit.

Pierre is a big fan of Artisan Movements, Regeneration activist, and Embodied collectivities. He reached out to me because he wants to build systems on EOS to incentivize collaboration between members of his community and then share those systems with other collectivities and markets. The goal is to build systems for worker-owned communities so people don't have to use payment processors & high-cost ERPs so more value stays in the hands of the people.

If you know people working on awesome projects that benefit society that could use EOS, the most decentralized and liquid EOSIO chain, reach out so they can do like Pierre. ü§ì

## EOS Price Prediction 2022

If this bullish trend continues, EOS will reach $6.45 by the end of 2022. Moreover, the first half of 2022 is going to show fast growth, up to $4.437. Then this rise will slow down, but no major falls are expected. With upcoming, partnership, and developments reaching $10 is quite optimistic in the price point of view but undoubtedly feasible for the near future.

&#x200B;

 Larimer has been on this journey for some time. Delegated proof of stake was his first effort with Bitshares while Steemit used token weighted voting. Voice.com was a continuation of these efforts ‚Äì albeit not a very successful one. Since leaving B1, though, he‚Äôs been cranking up his efforts to realise his vision of decentralised governance as set out in his book [‚ÄòMore Equal Animals‚Äô,](https://moreequalanimals.com/) with the creation of Eden and now Fractally.

**13 seed EOS** is playing **4 seed Dogecoin** in the first round of the 3rd Annual Ultimate Crypto Tournament!

Voting has begun and will run for 3 days. The coin with more votes will move on to the next round to play the winner of: **5. Wrapped Bitcoin** vs. **12. Zcash**

For those unfamiliar, this is modeled after March Madness where the top 64 coins face off in a single elimination tournament. The winner moves on and the loser is out. The last coin left is declared the champion.

This is EOS‚Äôs third straight tournament appearance. Last year, EOS took home the banner as the 2021 Ultimate Cryptocurrency, after running through Algorand, Elrond, Tezos, SushiSwap, Bitcoin Cash, and Dash. What a run! In 2020, it fell in the second round to Zcash after defeating OmiseGO. Tell your friends and maybe your frenemies; the more votes the better! Good luck this year!

This is a real event, not spam and it‚Äôs just for fun. I know that different coins have different functions so it‚Äôs sometimes silly to ask ‚Äúwhich is better,‚Äù but I‚Äôm still doing it because I think it‚Äôs fun. If this isn‚Äôt the type of post for this subReddit, I apologize and won‚Äôt post here again.

However, there‚Äôs more that we can do today to fast-track this vital process.

Each component in this process needs to pull its weight for the chain reaction to work optimally in producing results. That also means that we as EOS stakeholders need to hold ourselves accountable in our efforts to inspect that everything is functioning as optimally as it should.

If we can all work towards this, then there‚Äôs no limit to the things this community can achieve on our way to a four-billion-dollar DAO (community), and beyond.

In a contest that was never in doubt, Larimer‚Äôs Faithful took it to Zcash from start to finish.

Now, a tougher challenge awaits. The next opponent is **8. Algorand**, whom EOS defeated in last year‚Äôs championship game with the help of a vocal and boisterous Venezuelan contingent that has been oddly silent in this year‚Äôs tourney. Algo is rarin‚Äô to go, desiring revenge for last year‚Äôs defeat. 

Algorand comes into the game on fire, having defeated 9. Monero and 1. BNB in the first two rounds.

Voting begins tonight at midnight and runs for 72 hours. The winner will play the winner of: **3. Solana** and **10. VeChain** for a trip to the Final Four!

Vote at: [https://twitter.com/UltimateCrypto7](https://twitter.com/UltimateCrypto7) and please vote for the other games as well if it‚Äôs not too much trouble.

ZEOS will enable fully private transactions on the EOS mainnet with fee-less transactions and half second block times. The long term goal of ZEOS is to create tools that empower developers to build an entirely private DeFi ecosystem on the EOS mainnet.

Transactions with ZEOS are based on zero knowledge proofs, which is the state of the art technology for private transactions. Zero Knowledge Proofs (or ZK-Proofs) can also enable Layer 2 Rollup scaling solutions to increase capacity for transactions on EOS without compromising security. ZEOS raised funding on Pomelo by creating open-source libraries & tutorials to make it easy for EOS developers to integrate zero knowledge proofs with many EOS applications.

I think it has set itself apart fundamentally from what I understand of other smart contract base layers like ETH, PLS, BSC, TRX, ADA, etc.It's bounce back in user interest and fucus has been encouraging. Dan being back is beautiful.I feel EOS is iterations ahead. Though, It does need to continue what it's doing, changing and iterating, marketing etc. to arrive at the top.

My biggest concern is its ability to last through a difficult macro environment. I feel a short bull run is in play, but feel a parabolic top with all time highs in short term is unlikely (for crypto in general). I see a path where we approach or exceed lows again before the all time high.

I think if EOS and team can continue focusing, building and improving, even if price is unreflective of it's good in that short term, it will arise as a top player in users, utility and price.If more disappointing price is enough to ruin moral, and too little to provide short term funding, the past hard work is for not for EOS holders.

I'm currently betting it will make it through the dip of hard times and arrive as a significant, meaningful player. But as usual, time will tell.

I see it possible for all time highs in crypto to be years away, EOS included. (I'd love to be wrong.)That said, I see the spring tightening and when all time highs do come, those who purchased the dips of those tokens that survive, doing well.

I have an affinity for projects influenced by Dan's world view, innovation and creativity. I feel the world will be a better place if they can survive and thrive.I plan to continue dollar cost averaging, which I hope my small input will be a part of what helps EOS and like come out the other end strong.","self","https://redd.it/trev6l"

Social users can also go ad-free if they choose to opt out of rewards...sorta like brave browser.

...anyway, I have been considering Blockchain options for a while now. I was back and forth btw SOL and EOS and now considering TLOS. Finally this blockone drama is over, so I feel more confident about the future of EOS.

Im looking for honest feedback, and not just trolls shouting ""EOS is at $2"" like morons. I welcome constructive criticism if you think the idea is bogus or you want to recommend a more fitting Blockchain for the token contract. Thank you!

EOS.IO ‚Äî HOW EOS Works
Introduction To EOS: what Is EOS?

EOS.IO (often referred to as ‚Äò EOS ‚Äô) is a consensus-driven decentralized app (dApp) platform developed by block.one, which uses EOS tokens to fund and facilitate various network operations. It is essentially an operating system that runs apps on decentralized infrastructure, which is distributed around the world. The network utilizes distributed ledger technology (blockchain in this case ) to store and confirm transactions and it executes smart contracts on its blockchain. Its symbol on cryptocurrency exchange is EOS.

EOS.IO is an open-source community project, meaning that developers can submit improvement to the core developers ( block.one) and is maintained by Block.one with the help of the open-source community via GitHub. The EOS.IO source code is released under an MIT license, which means it can be modified and redistributed provided that the terms in the license are met.

EOS.IO was first released on January 31,2018, and the official network ( main network ) was launched in June 2018.

The EOS Token
The EOS token is a digital currency that can be sent between EOS account holders to pay for the usage of RAM, CPUs, and the network. EOS tokens can also be used for other things such as paying for goods or services (for example : a glazed donuts), similarly to a fiat currency. In contrast to fiat currency (eg. US Dollar), EOS tokens are not represented by physical bank notes (eg. dollar bills) and the price of EOS tokens is set by demand and supply.

Like fiat currencies, EOS tokens are not backed by a physical commodity such as gold. However, EOS tokens distributions is handled differently from that of fiat currencies. Fiat currencies are issued by central banks, and the first EOS tokens were distributed via an ICO. However, inflation funds the EOS network by generating tokens to pay block producers (discussed below) among other things. This is why EOS transactions are free.

The design of EOS was partially inspired by Bitcoin, which also uses blockchain technology that produces blocks containing transactions signed with the sender‚Äôs private keys. A key difference between EOS and Bitcoin is the consensus algorithm. Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm while EOS uses a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Delegated Proof-of-Stake (BFT-DPoS) algorithm. The Proof-of-Work algorithm works by having miners solve blocks (mine blocks) in exchange for a reward (Bitcoin, which incentivize mining).

Mining is energy-intensive due to high computational power requirements. However, it is a strong deterrent against excessive inflation. The energy usage of mining is ever-increasing due to its competitive nature, leading to the pursuit of PoS alternatives such as EOS.

The EOS Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
EOS tokens were distributed between June 2017 and June 2018 as part of Initial Coin Offering (ICO) held by block.one. The ICO raised about $4hub billion dollars.

EOS Transfers/Storage
EOS tokens are stored in EOS account which are secured by two pairs of cryptographic keys, each containing one an private key and one public key. There is an owner key pair and an active key pair. 4 keys in all. The owner key pair (and even the owner keys). The active keys are used for day-to-day activities such as staking, voting and transferring tokens. Your owner key should be locked away and only your active key should be imported into wallets.

The ability to change your EOS account keys is useful in the event that they are stolen. While an EOS account has a private key for signing transactions as well as a public keys, the public keys is not what you send your tokens to.

It‚Äôs your account name, which is a 12-digit string ( a word or combination of letters and numerals ranging from 1‚Äì5). This means you can remember EOS account names, instead of having to read through a long cryptographic key every time history instead of a hash. To be fair, you can create an address book in your Bitcoin wallet app and put your friend‚Äôs names in it.

How to Send Tokens
You can send funds (EOS tokens in this case ) to a friend via the following steps:

If you owe the person a certain amount in USD, divide the USD amount by the USD price of EOS to determine how many EOS tokens that works out to.
Enter the number of tokens to send in your wallet app.
Enter the 12-digit account name of the person you are sending the tokens to or scan their QR code (usually by clicking ‚Äòscan‚Äô).
click send!
Your friend should receive the tokens in a matter of seconds (it has been averaging less than 2 second for me ). Your wallet app should have a transaction list containing the transaction ID. You can copy and paste this ID in an EOS block explorer to confirm that the transaction has been sent. Your wallet app may also just let you click the transaction and automatically bring it up for you in a block explorer for your convenience.

The transaction will become irreversible in a moment. If your friend wants to refund you, just have them follow the same process and just send the same amount back to your account

EOS Basics: Securing Your EOS wallet

Two of the gravest threats to your wallet/account is the theft and loss of your EOS tokens. You must ensure that your Never send anyone your wallet file(if any) or private keys. It is never necessary.
Never visit website that you don‚Äôt trust, or which are likely to contain malware.
Always make a copy of your wallet file or keys (Backup) to a secure location off your computer such as a USB thumb drive.
Ensure the backup drive above is never used for anything else or shared with anyone. stow it away safely.
Don‚Äôt use wallet apps that you haven‚Äôt researched/confirmed to be trustworthy.
Don‚Äôt store most of your tokens on exchanges. Use a hardware or desktop wallet that gives you exclusive possession of your keys.

Activities on the EOS.IO blockchain are ‚Äòaction‚Äô, and there are different types of actions. If you are sending funds(EOS tokens or tokens on the EOS network) to someone, that action is called a ‚Äòtransfer‚Äô. Example pf actions on EOS.IO include, but are not limited to :

transfer (send tokens).
voteproducer (vote for block producers).
delegatebw (staking network resources).
undelegatebw (unstaking network resources).

EOS Basics: Securing Your EOS wallet
EOS block are created by block producers (BPs) every 0.5 seconds. At any given moment, there are 21 block producers on EOS, which generate 6 blocks each. This means that 126 blocks are produced per round. Block production is a fundamental part of how EOS works, as transactions are placed in block producers. Only one BP is authorized to produce a block in a 24-hour period, they are omitted from the block production process until they notify the EOS chain of their intention to continue block production.

voting for block producers
On the EOS network , it is EOS tokens holders that vote for block producers and the number of tokens they have staked is what determines the weight of their vote. EOS also has a referendum system for users to vote on changes themselves, making the EOS network democratic in nature.

Staking EOS Tokens
Some or all of an account‚Äôs EOS tokens can be staked by the owner and used to vote for block producers, and for EOS referendums. Staking is a 3-days contract ( it takes 3 days to unstake EOS tokens) that reserves a portion of the system resources on the EOS network for your account. Such resources include NET bandwidth, CPU bandwidth, RAM on the other hand can be purchased using EOS tokens. These resources are provided by block producers.

EOS Development: EOS.IO Smart Contracts
An EOS smart contract is a digitally-enforced set of rules encoded on the blockchain that is autonomously enforced. EOS dApps utilize smart contracts. EOS.IO smart contract are executed without having to pay or involve an intermediary. As is the case with a traditional contract, a smart contract may enforce penalties or carry out obligation encoded in the contract.

Therefore, an EOS smart contract can do something automatically if certain conditions are met. How does this differs from electronic services that already do all that without a blockchain or smart contracts? For example: A customers submitting an order in an online store and the store‚Äôs software generates the invoice and shipping label automatically.

There are multiple reasons: including security, data loss, transparency, and real-time collaboration with businesses outside of your own. Smart contracts are a fundamental part of how EOS works, but most notably how dApps work on the EOS network.

EOS smart contracts ( or smart contracts on any other platform) may also play a role in physical activities such as collaboration between logistics networks ( for examples: Courier A may contract the services of courier B to pick up the slack if they don‚Äôt have enough delivery vans a busy day, if you will).

A rough example I made up is: If a UPS package is delayed due to a lack of vans, UPS could use a smart contact to instantly submit an order to whichever courier has the lowest bid posted on the blockchain to intercept that package and deliver it to the customers. No human would ever have to place such an order themselves. Doing this between only two couriers may not needs a blockchain, but a bidding system involving many couriers calls for either a blockchain with smart contract, or a potentially expensive intermediary.

Real-word EOS Smart Contract Examples
There are many dApps on the EOS network powered by smart contract and they include, but are not limited to:

decentralized Exchange (DEX).
Email dApps.
Social Networks (more like twitter).
Instant Messaging dApps.
Job Network/Freelancing Platforms.
Card Games.
Email dApps

Don‚Äôt be fooled by the term ‚ÄòdApp‚Äô. An email dApp is just an email app that happens to run on a decentralized platform ( such as EOS, or the email dApp could have its own platform ). One example of an email dApp with users is dmail. Dmail is an encrypted email app that operates on the EOS.IO blockchain.

Dmail is on-chain email in that it operates on the EOS blockchain and your email address in this case is your EOS account name, rather than something like ‚Äòusername@dmail.com‚Äô. This means that dmail addresses are significantly shorter than email addresses (they‚Äôre only 12 digits ).

However, they are limited to the EOS blockchain at the time this article was written. This means that you must have an EOS account in order to use dmail. dmail uses ‚ÄòMAIL‚Äô tokens to disincentivize spam, as sending a dmail will cost you a token. dmail tokens were distributed for free to early adopters for free to get them started, and 1,000 tokens each is enough for them to email each other.

If someone replied to you on dmail, you receive a tokens back from them, so a back-and-fourth conversation with someone costs you nothing. However, if a spammer wants to send out 10,000 emails. They would need 10,000 of the MAIL tokens, which complicates matters for them. Like other activities on the EOS.IO blockchain, dmails are sent it operates by sending tokens.

Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)
A decentralized exchange (DEX) runs independently of a corporation. However, a corporation may be involved in the development or maintenance of its source code or binaries.

One example of a decentralized exchange running on the EOS blockchain is EOSDAQ. You can submit an order to this DEX without having having to manually create an account and deposit funds, and then submitting your order separately. If using the exchange in an EOS wallet app such as EOS lynx, you can do everything with a few clicks and an EOS smart contract will handle the order‚Äôs execution.

For example: You can swing by EOSDAQ without ever signing up for an account, and submit an order immediately. This is done using smart contracts. If the order is fulfilled, the EOS-based tokens you purchased will be sent to your wallet automatically.

You don‚Äôt have to store any funds on a DEX (at least not that one). This is especially important considering that storing large portions of your funds on an exchanges is a dangerous practices, even with two-factor authentication.


Using Blockchain To Build Trust (with the help of immutability)
Despite not requiring identification, which poses the risk of an unscrupulous account holder simply creating a new account if they‚Äôve been caught scamming someone. An upcoming EOS account holder can build trust among other users whom have never even interacted with them by consistently staying true to their word.

How? All of that account‚Äôs activity is on the EOS.IO blockchain and can be proven by anyone by pulling up their account in an EOS block explorer. They can even contract the account holders that interacted with them for feedback on what their experience with them was like.

One could also see if reputable account holders have been consistently interacting with the upcoming account. This could server as a good sign that the upcoming account holder has integrity. This could incentivize good people to stick with one account and build a reputation.

EOS Transaction Capacity/EOS TPS Rating
The transaction capacity of EOS, typically measured in transactions per second (tps) is in the range of 3,000 to just under 4,000 tps. As is the case with other platforms, EOS has been receiving updates and may exceed that transaction capacity in the future.

EOS 2.0 has announced and is capable of reducing execution times significantly as well as improving the overall network performance of EOS, thanks to the EOS VM/JIT compiler.

EOS vs Layer 2 Scaling Solutions
A key selling point of EOS.IO is its scalability. EOS is capable of achieving a throughout of thousands of transactions per second (TPS). Mined cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum typically achieve less than 15 TPS .

EOS uses rapid block production, a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, and few block producers to achieve this high throughput and low latency. Layer 2 Scaling solutions don‚Äôt scale on the main chain as EOS.IO does. Some layers 2 solutions lock tokens on the main chain (for example: Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain) and then settle transactions rapidly on their own ‚Äòside‚Äô chains.

This is done using smart contracts. Once these layer 2 solution have completed settlement, they update the state of the main chain (eventually).

Layer 2 scaling solutions usually use their own sidechain for settlement or state channels. EOS.IO has been touted as a possible scaling solution by its creators due to its high transaction capacity.

The lightning network uses state channels and is one of the most popular alternatives to EOS due to its impressively high transaction capacity. One reason for layer 2 scaling solutions is to help existing blockchain without modifying their own consensus algorithms.","self","https://redd.it/uevb57"

\#Recap Eden Member group, 7 days Saturday-Friday 2022-04-29

\#-#-#

\#Author\_Comments : Eden asset ownership and organizational matters much discussed this week. Another extensive topic was ""Fractally"" and Eden membership view of the same and views on Eden members using their time and resources in the same.

\#-#-#

\#Accountability :

\--M1-- : ""Which organization should control the Eden Github repo? A capable team that replaces the Clarion/Fractally team? What are your thoughts on custodianship of Eden assets?""

\--M2--: ""IMO Eden as an organization should have 'Roles' that are defined by the CDs and appointed by them as well. ""

\--M3--: ""I was thinking the same‚Ä¶ I think Eden should do Eden. So anything that's needed to be maintained or undertaken should be done so by elected Eden Members.""

\--M4--: ""I'd like to add that these members be subject to the same rules as the submission and change to the by laws, that is to say . . ""

\--M1--: ""I'm not sure about this...if you have a bad actor in a role, needing to wait for a subsequent election to replace them is likely too much latency to minimize the damage that the bad actor can inflict.""

\--M4--: ""Yeah, I'm not sure about it either, but thought the question should be discussed.""

\--M5--: ""Eden could collaborate with Hypha . . for everything other than inducting members and electing delegates, etc? Hypha software is designed for organizational management, not just inviting members and electing delegates.""

\--M6--: ""The thing is that the positions we are discussing should serve Eden's ultimate purpose, not the Delegates personal goals. CDs serve Eden's interests too. Just like them, a dev team delegated to take care of it on behalf Eden interest is what I picture.""

\#Eden\_Accounting\_Standard : How Eden funds allocated.

\--CD1--: "" Proposal Eden Accounting Standard. Feedback welcome in forum! [https://forums.eoscommunity.org/t/eden-delegates-accounting-standard/5826](https://forums.eoscommunity.org/t/eden-delegates-accounting-standard/5826) ""

\--M1--: ""This is awesome. An initial question, is there a space limit to the memo field?""

\#Fractally :

\--CD1-- : ""I am totally in favor of any Eden member deciding what is of benefit to the EOS Ecosystem and acting in that manner. Does Eden as a group consider work on ∆íractally to be a good use of Eden-derived resources? (I am asking)""

\--M1-- : ""Considering the current mission of Eden is ""To create value for the EOS ecosystem"" and there has been no commitment at all from the Fractally team to include EOS in their future plans, I would vote no, this is not a good use of Eden-derived resources.""

\--M2-- : ""If Eden Members want to move in the direction of what's proposed in the Fractally white paper, then we have a dedicated group for that. You can message me if you want the link to that group. Eden seems to have some immediate needs and short-term obstacles to overcome and it would be helpful if every member can focus on achieving the next logical steps first and foremost.""

\--M3-- : ""My confusion is honest. Until we receive a Notice of a determination there is a surgical ""divorce by splitting (or forking a chain) the code, or other Fiat""‚Ä¶ I see EOS, EdenonEOS, and fractally as Siamese Triplets. I am convinced we should walk in sync, unless we are not ""better together.""

\--M4-- : ""There is no true or false. I don't disagree with you. The fractal paradigm is everywhere in any of the ecosystems (Eden, Hu-Fi ,EOS Bees, Fractally ...). Our society has to collaborate and EOS is the perfect example of an Everyone's Open Society.""

\#Eden\_future :

\--M1-- : ""hmm so is Eden for projects or leadership?

Really was pretty sure after talking to everyone last election we were going for leaders. Haven't seen any direction besides ""value"". Maybe the bylaws should explain what value means and how the process increases value. Value is subject to a person who values it. Collaborate systems work when focusing on one goal, and I hope to learn what that goal is in more concrete terms.""

\--CD1-- : ""It's still not formulated to anyone's satisfaction. You know how hard a bylaws change is. The bylaws can't explain what value is. The subjectivity of it is what gives Eden members full latitude to pursue/fund any project that they want. If it turns out that they squandered their resources (AND TIME!!!) then Eden members should step up and be vocal about it.""

\--M2--: ""Once we've achieved measurable results, gained the respect and trust of the broader community, including BPs, then we can broaden our horizons and our mission. If we were to follow this with any level of real commitment, I don't think it would take longer than a year for Eden to achieve immense results.""

\--M2--: ""I suggest we come up with some definable ways to measure ""value"" as I absolutely agree that focus is often critical to success.""

\#EOSIO\_future :

\--M1--: ""The new coalition of EOS, TELOS, WAX and UX already has a budget for professional rebranding of EOSIO. I recommend we waste zero time duplicating efforts there. We desperately need pros to do this stuff for us.""

I've been doing my own research on EOS and creeping on the crypto project for months. I keep flirting with the idea to add EOS to my portfolio, but always get cold feet. Now with the latest bear market trend, I'm in a very strong position with available FIAT to do an aggressive EOS daily DCA.

So what's my hesitation? Primarily EOS' current market position/rank. Is the current EOS market cap of \~2.3B strong enough to be a lasting alt. coin throughout the bear market? I similarly hold GRT & AAVE with equal concern already.

What is the current temperature check on the EOS community (confident or remorse)? Are you in hold or buy pattern?

\#Author\_Comments : The latest CD meetings been setting the tone for much of discussions in the Eden Member group. The quality, or rather lack thereof, in some EOSIO BPs and the voting for BPs became main topics through this week. This recap just a very tiny fraction of the rich and ""deep"" discussions.  
\#-#-#

\#EOSIO\_EOS\_future :  
\--M1--: ""I think it would be awesome for either Eden or the ENF to establish a fund for attracting projects from other chains and facilitate porting over, or them being multichain, especially once the EVM is up and running. A Committee could be created by interested Eden Members and work with Eden Funding or apply to the ENF for funding from them.""  
\--M2--: ""To attract other chain Dapp developers we need to have a large user base, to get that we need just 1 killer Dapp, who‚Äôs building it? Easy onboarding free to use.""  
\--M1-- : ""I take your point though, that some Dapp Developers depending on what they're building will be looking to come on board an ecosystem with users. If that's the case, this is where we need to sweeten the pot/temporarily subsidize them to use the EVM and discover the benefits of utilizing EOS first. This can grow our users/onchain transactions and can save them some cash at first, and jumpstart the network effect.""

\#Eden\_future : (referencing EdenOnEOS Chief Delegate Meeting #5 - Sat. May 14, 2022):  
""This weeks u/EdenOnEOS Chief Delegate meeting is not one to miss! There is a bold vision being formed, and the #EOS community is likely to have an opinion! Let's see what the u/EosNFoundation makes of the CD's latest democratic overtures! üòâ $eos""

\#ENF\_Eden :  
\--M1--: ""ENF serves the network and the network needs to be optimized""  
\--M2--: ""if members who want to run organizations and initiatives want to do so to better the network then they should go for it.""  
\--M1--: ""ENF can also delegate voting to Eden and/or to a proxy"".  
\--M2--: ""üëéwe are about to destroy EOS""  
\--M3--: ""ENF may of course vote with their own tokens... nothing wrong there. If BPs want money to run infra, they could pitch to ENF to get some funding, but I don't see why ENF would proactively go looking for BP candidates to fund."".  
\--M1--: ""ENF is currently our best bet for cutting the deadweight BPs"".  
\--M2--: ""they are. they are really doing a great job"".  
\--M3--: ""It's a difficult question as these are tokens being allocated to the ENF by the network. Conflicts of interest arise. What if the current BPs asked that IF the ENF votes it's only allowed to vote for the current top 21? giving way to further centralization.""  
\--M1--: ""If EOS doesn't prioritize having amazing (above and beyond) BPs, then it will likely be outcompeted by networks who do prioritize it. And rightfully so. I'd like to see where seriously addressing this BP thing is on the collective roadmap for the EOS network.""

\#Eden\_Proxy :  
\--M1--: ""Quick question: if we have 181,815 EOS in the Eden Treasury, why is it the Eden Proxies only have 66,000 votes? Before discussing the ENF voting with their tokens, shouldn't this be taken care of first?""  
\--M2-- ""Eden Treasury doesn‚Äôt vote for Eden Proxy""  
\--M1--: ""Shouldn't it?""  
\--M2--: ""It was suggested in the CD meeting. To send a signal""  
\--M1--: ""Hard to discuss whether the ENF should or could do anything in regards to voting if we haven't done it ourselves"".  
\--CD1--: ""Eden's elected leadership don't have the active keys for the genesis.eden account yet.""  
\--M1--: ""I'm for making bold moves in both the governance and finances of the network. We all know what needs to be done, the question is whether or not we have the power and will to do it. I applaud Yves for having taken the initiative in both and working within the confines of the system as is, and blazing a trail forward where no one new how.""  
\--CD1--: ""Maybe many of the paid BPs look around and see the ones doing nothing and want to change things, but they can't. They would be waiting for an organization like EDEN to come along, demonstrate that it understands what is happening, and maybe those BPs would be amenable to giving this organization some voting weight to attempt to address the problem.""

\#EdenOnEOS :  
\--CD1--: ""The transparency projects that many have been speaking of and hoping for, and building piecemeal - those projects can become a core mission of Eden. Chain Transparency. If Eden wanted to, it could replicate our process, and any other cool apps that we're going to be creating and bundle them into a dapp that others can use. At the moment though, others can't just use Eden without a great deal of wasted energy.""  
\--M1--: ""So genesis eden might have to polish edenOS for the best of what genesis eden wants to do.""  
\--CD1--: ""Sure, get the contracts and interfaces built so that others can use them.""  
\--M1--: ""this brings up the point that the most important thing is ""the eden process."" The edenOS code can be rewritten but the concept of electing people to distribute funds, or build a community throught consensus is the ""gem"" perhaps??""  
\--CD1--: ""Yeah, finding that 'gem' has been difficult. I think it's the political playoffs process itself. It seems to work, but only when there is a sufficiently large/diverse group of people playing the game.""

\#Sybil :  
\--M1--: ""Annual dues and intro meetings are both imperfect sybil resistance, not sybil proof. The election is theoretically sybil proof, although I look forward to analyzing an attempted attack at some point. But it's also not a big deal to allow sybil attacks if there are no positive rights given to the community at large, and all benefits are a function of one's participation in elections.""  
\--M2--: ""Maybe at some point Eden should run a test election where it provides a bounty for white-hat sybil attackers who reveal shortcomings and suggest solutions.  We are in the era of deep fakes now.""  
\--M3--: ""the bounties often stimulate putting fakes in (they again incentivise attackers to collect them, because price of putting them there and pointing to them is far smaller than researching where the real attackers at.""  
\--M4--: ""Then we may just need some sort of system that rewards or tracks reputation. Where when someone is caught doing something shady, they have something to lose.""

1) it requires time for all of these things to be completed

DeFi is currently fractured across many different blockchains. Chains like Ethereum and Solana lead the way, while others like BSV, Avalanche, and Fantom are growing rapidly. Unfortunately, EOS is not currently participating meaningfully in this market ‚Äì it lags behind other comparable chains in terms of overall DeFi activity.

Other chains, notably Fantom, have introduced Liquidity Rewards Programs that have greatly increased the amount of developer and user activity within their DeFi offerings. These programs create frameworks for measuring the total amount of DeFi activity across various decentralized applications (dApps) and services and then provide token rewards to those that generate the most activity.

This paper presents an overview of comparable programs on other chains and proposes a custom Liquidity Rewards Program for the EOS Network. Our goal is to adapt and improve upon existing programs to benefit the EOS DeFi ecosystem as a whole, bring more activity on-chain, and increase earning opportunities for users.

Perhaps a privilege of Eden Membership can be the ability to participate in well structured and moderated, open public debates? No point in joining if you can get that privilege without joining.""  
\--M3-- : ""ya maybe it is (the open debate part). Maybe part of what Eden needs to do is define itself and its intentions in a public forum. Our public Eden channel seems to have the eye of many in the EOS community who actually care about EOS' success, so of all the places to debate the negative viewpoints, why not there, and if not there where else?""

\#EOS\_Yield+ : [https://t.me/c/1186628781/28471](https://t.me/c/1186628781/28471)  
""‚Äú... a liquidity rewards program designed to incentivize TVL in DeFi applications on EOS would be one of the most impactful drivers of network growth.‚Äù"" - [https://www.eosgo.io/news/yield-blue-paper-liqudity-rewards-on-eos](https://www.eosgo.io/news/yield-blue-paper-liqudity-rewards-on-eos)

\#EOS\_support : (some words related to ""ram cleaning"") :  
\- Question - ""Is there any information on how to do ram cleaning?""  
\- Answered - ""One case to free up RAM is: If you sell a token you hold in your EOS Account and the token balance is zero, if it doesn't automatically, you can recover RAM through the ""close"" action with Token's Contract.For EOS click here: [https://bloks.io/account/eosio.token?loadContract=true&tab=Actions&account=eosio.token&scope=eosio.token&limit=100&action=close](https://bloks.io/account/eosio.token?loadContract=true&tab=Actions&account=eosio.token&scope=eosio.token&limit=100&action=close) enter your eos account and symbol ""4,EOS""or another example for EOSDT here: [https://bloks.io/account/eosdtsttoken?loadContract=true&tab=Actions&account=eosdtsttoken&scope=eosdtsttoken&limit=100&action=close](https://bloks.io/account/eosdtsttoken?loadContract=true&tab=Actions&account=eosdtsttoken&scope=eosdtsttoken&limit=100&action=close)We don't have an article yet, but it's planned to write one for that topic.""

\#Moving\_Eden\_Forward : (discussion mainly among Eden members whom are also members of ∆íractally)  
""Focusing on the next logical actions steps for moving Eden forward. Wednesdays 1300 UTC - [https://gofractally.com/events/moving-eden-forward](https://gofractally.com/events/moving-eden-forward)""

\#EOS\_Community :  
\- Question - ""Do we have any new announcements?""  
\- Answered - ""The EOS community is rebranding the main net. There is a cooperative between EOS chains, there is good governance happening at EDEN, and the fractally white paper is being coded into a very exciting Blockchain application. EOS is evolving into a federation of DOAs, Smart Companies, and DACs, which separately and together are coding Open Source software solutions that are a strong foundation for public goods. In addition, for profit businesses are attracting VC funding to build on top of these blockchain and open source solutions.""

\#Fractally\_related : (& Eden connected)  
""Proposal for Eden Fractal - [https://edencreators.com/edenfractal](https://edencreators.com/edenfractal) \- I'm proposing the name ""Empowering Eden Contributors"" for this event.  
We are also looking to schedule another weekly meeting on another day of the week.  
Proposal for Fractal Forums - [https://edencreators.com/fractalforums](https://edencreators.com/fractalforums) \- I'm proposing the name ""Moving Eden Forward"" for this event.  
If the group is open to it, we may join on StreamYard to have the meeting there as part of the live stream event rather than on Zoom as we normally do. Not sure the level of interest yet. I'm just a facilitator. My suggestion for the Live Stream event is to theme it around these questions or something similar to spark convo and valuable content:What has been your greatest recent contribution to the EOS network?What's something valuable that you'd like to see happen next on EOS?""

\#DAOs\_Legal\_Wrapper :  
""New paper on legal wrapping for DAOs. Read and discuss!From [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4123737](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4123737)  
""'Finally, it is helpful to keep in mind that legal and operational timelines can vary considerably. In many instances, DAOs develop organically before their legal wrappers. DAOs can begin with a catalyst organizing a small community with a particular mission or goal. At the beginning stages, members coalesce around communication platforms like Discord and Telegram. As the DAO grows, members may, but certainly not always, choose to launch a token and potentially raise capital for the DAO‚Äôs treasury by having members contribute assets. DAOs commonly also leverage blockchain technology to implement governance over the DAO, a process that can involve using any number of open-source tools and dapps that have preset and customizable organizational structures or protocols. DAOs operating in this model tend to start small, and legal wrappers are often only considered as DAOs scale‚Äîor after they run into trouble due to a hack or operational problems that create liability.'""

\#ENF\_Eden : (related to #DAOs\_Legal\_Wrapper, words from Yves La Rose)  
""Please don't make Eden a formal legal entity. Please keep that out of bylaws. Please keep Eden as a smart contract operated DAO.""  
""CDs can form an entity to interact with the ""real world"" if they wish (that's not Eden). I will not support, and would campaign against, getting Eden to be a formal entity. Please don't transform Eden itself into a formal legal entity.""  
""I am not neutral on Eden's future. I wish to see it succeed and fill a key role. Grow your membership. Become a non-arguable weight within the ecosystem.""

\#DAOs\_Legal\_Wrapper :  
\--M1-- : ""Uniqueness is attractive. We don't all have to agree on the definition of DAO... It's a logical process set in motion by people. And we have to tend to it carefully, like one does any garden. Gardens are themselves like systems of smart contracts, with various yields from unique processes.Eden's main strength is that it is a collection of real people from around the world who are not worried about fitting into a single set of regional laws. We're trying to build something that is supra-national. If individuals wish to create a 'legal wrapper' for a specific purpose, it's something that they can do. But they can't speak for the whole organization, without basically inviting an enemy to come and set up in our garden permanently.""  
\--M2-- : ""The amount of time and energy on the idea of Eden on EOS being turned into or using a company...""  
\--M3-- : ""From my perspective on what a DAO is, which is the only direction in which I personally support Eden progressing, ""Eden's next step..."" doesn't even make grammatical sense. Eden doesn't take steps. Members take steps. I member wants to form a legal entity, he should do so. Members can do things, and we are all using the fractal governance process to organize our efforts toward a common goal. I'm starting to prefer thinking that what we are \*doing\* is DAO. We are exhibiting decentralized & autonomous organization, rather than being ""a"" decentralized autonomous organization, which apparently implies to most people a form of top-down organization that I think isn't super compatible with fractal gov.  
""--M1-- : ""We have to think about what Eden can be in 3,5,7,10 years. When you really step back and consider the potential, we are on the bleeding edge of DAO technology and techniques. This is much more than just a process.""

\#EdenOnEOS :  
\--M1-- : ""Establish a purpose and have people vote in line with what the objective is. I agree if someone feels that a Delegates project is in-line with the over-all objective, and values that in his group more than the consensus builder who can't get the guy with the project to back down, I don't see how you can control for this. Other than stating somewhere that elections are ""to select for consensus builders able to establish consensus amongst their peers and provide the most value to their organization (in our case EOS).""  
""--M2-- : ""I'm fully in agreement that this Eden org needs more direction and clarity as to our purpose through clear objectives and measurable KPI.""  
\--M3-- : ""I think the objective that we should aim to achieve is simply to help Eden. It doesn‚Äôt really matter if someone is building a project or just aiming to lead Eden. The only voting criteria should be how much each person helps Eden. The Eden process takes care of the rest by enabling each community member to express their opinions about who or what is most helpful for Eden.""  
\--M4-- : ""I wholeheartedly disagree with the faith in actors I generally feel here. We're not building Eden for Us(EOS). We're building it for everyone. If we can't reach consensus on what is True North, all other consensus is worthless.""  
\--M3-- : ""Why would it matter whether someone is building a project or just leading? I don‚Äôt see any reason to make a distinction about leaders or projects in the bylaws. People can help however they want and voters decide what‚Äôs most helpful.""  
\--M5-- : ""This group was founded by a bunch of key people in the EOS community, and then it was funded by the Block Producers, many of which are counted among Eden's members. They did this with the knowledge that Eden members had already spoken about working towards improving Delegated Proof of Stake - of working to build a human element that could help enhance the cold logic of DPoS consensus. This network is on the cusp of spectacular success, and I am confident that it will handle it well, because it has already proven how well it can handle failure and disappointment. If there is a crisis that Eden can address though, it is getting this decentralized organization ready to actually matter to people when EOS starts to really take off.""

\#EdenOnEOS : ([https://t.me/EdenOSinfo](https://t.me/EdenOSinfo) offered to Eden CDs)  
""Yo I‚Äôm not paying attention much, so any of the CDs who want total ownership control of the EdenOnEOS channel just give me a shout and I‚Äôll change the ownership to whomever you want it changed to.""

Blockchain is essentially a shared database in which data or information is stored. It has the characteristics of non-forgery, full traces, traceability, openness and transparency, and collective maintenance.

&#x200B;

The block hash value is randomly generated in the decentralized blockchain network, which is unique and cannot be tampered with. Anyone can query the records on the blockchain, and all data cannot be manipulated by humans.","self","https://redd.it/v8y77d"

\#Chinese\_Eden :  
\--M1-- : ""Welcome to follow Chinese Eden, we have a separate Discord and Medium, and all proposals and election process will be posted in the EOS Community Forum.

\--M2-- : ""Sure thing...  
I'd love to invite you or any representative of it to the EOS Translation Foundation Telegram group.We want to address all this language barriers and solve them for easier interaction.""  
\--M1-- : ""We also have a DAO called EDAO, which we improved Daniel's fractally and used it to provide more support services for elected projects. Everyone in the community can get involved, do the work needed for the project, and report back at the weekly meetings for rewards.""  
\--M2-- : ""Come around. We'll be happy to help. [https://t.me/EOSTranslationFoundation](https://t.me/EOSTranslationFoundation)""

\#EdenOnEOS\_Benefits :  
""Welcome to Eden members private group üéâ [https://help.eossupport.io/en/articles/5889843-what-are-the-benefits-of-becoming-an-eden-member](https://help.eossupport.io/en/articles/5889843-what-are-the-benefits-of-becoming-an-eden-member)""

\#Fractally\_related : (& Eden connected) :  
"""" ""Don't Give Fractally the Time of Day""  
This is an extreme and antagonistic statement of how we should proceed.  
But I do think, we should focus on building Eden. If we want to adopt aspects of Fractally, why not. But not Fractally. In general, at the current date and time, with the information at hand, my perspective has not changed. I would not vote to ""become a Fractal"" of Fractally. I encourage greater focus and development of Eden, and EdenOnEOS. I don't want to draw this conversation out more than it needs to given this is Eden, and Fractally is nowhere near a state where we could evaluate its adoption.""""

\#Accountability :  
\--M1-- : ""Eden members who wish to be vocal and report their CDs on not fulfilling promises should feel encouraged to do so, and ofc address the matter politely and with the respect any person deserves, as well presenting the proof of the claims.""  
\--M2-- : ""It is my understanding, that the people who elected the delegates are responsible for holding them accountable. In an ideal system, voters could have the opportunity to rate their delegates or at least make a statement as to whether they have kept their word on what they promised.""  
\--M3-- : ""Ideally what would be of use is a place where public comments/questions/concerns can be posted about each Eden Delegate. There the Delegate could publicly respond to defend themselves, or even just to explain their thinking for deviating from a promise or something.""

üî• **Mandel v3.1.0-rc1 Release** is out on EOS anniversary (4 years!). What is it about in short?

ü™Ñ The release includes upgrades enabling contracts to get the current block number and to accelerate various cryptographic computation, as well as many other new features.

As explained in the [release notes](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/mandel/releases/tag/v3.1.0-rc1), ‚Äúall of these new host functions serve to reduce CPU costs of executing the cryptographic functions available in EVM precompiled contracts.""

‚úä We at Everstake have upgraded the Mandel node to v3.1.0-rc1 in Jungle 4 Testnet.

After the market fell on the NFT Atomichub exchange, it became more difficult to earn money, mainly these are p2e games related to the wax blockchain. The only way to make a lot of money on Atomichub is to resell, but it‚Äôs not always possible to catch NFT below the market price by 40-50%, but time goes by and one of the WAX ‚Äã‚ÄãBlockchain developers, who left the company in 2020, wrote his bot, which not only automatically searches and buys the NFTs you need at the specified% of the market price, and also sells and exchanges in automatic mode, passive trading is obtained absolutely free, more about this he made a video that I will present below!

The bleak 2018 crypto market is probably the epitome of ‚ÄúICO bubble bursts‚Äù.

https://preview.redd.it/fgq4ujc9py791.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=d969536b8dd58696cf34db1beb06f9cab87fc256

The ICO boom reminds me of Edward Chancellor‚Äôs book ‚ÄúA History of Financial Speculation‚Äù which describes the tulip bubble and the collapse of Kamikaze Capitalism, if someone hope to continue the book, the dot-com bubble and the ICO bubble, in my opinion, could be a wonderful chapter, too. I am deeply impressed by the endless plunge of the 2018 crypto market. With the hype of BTC and ETH, cryptocurrencies gained seemingly unstoppable momentum, numerous investors flocked in, pushing the token price higher and higher. An increasing number of investors were expecting lucrative profits around the New Year, not realizing the approaching of an epic burst of bubble at all.

What is an ICO? ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is the cryptocurrency industry‚Äôs way to raise fund by initially offering reasonably-evaluated new coins on a blockchain-based platform. ICO used to be an exclusive game for technical gurus in the early days. However, with the launch of ERC 20 token standard (token maps team value or stands for a proof of stake) in November 2015, Ethereum becomes an Android-like open source platform that allows everyone to develop Ethereum-based token. Token that meets the standard can be sold publicly and automatically to raise fund without third-party supervision, providing convenient ICO access to those who have little technical knowledge.

With ETH lowering the entry barrier for ICO, the exponentially increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies brings in huge amount of speculative fund. Being hyped as the next Internet opportunity, the market value of ETH and ETH-related coins started to soar. Bitcoin price increased 10x in one year from early 2017 to February 2018, ETH made an over 100x price rise in 2017, from $7.98 on January 1, 2017, to over $800 in December 2017, and reached a high of $1,432 in January 2018.

The sky-rocketing token price brings considerable profit to ICO teams. With near-zero token-issuing cost, ICO teams get tens of millions of investment within seconds with a whitepaper and a business model, making ICO a well-known ‚Äúshortcut to wealth‚Äù.

For example: Block.one‚Äôs year-long ICO enabled EOS to raise nearly $4.4 billion. RSK, ICP, BLZ, and OXT easily raised hundreds of millions of dollars in a few minutes, which was quite normal in crypto space at that time. After realizing hosting ICO has much higher profit than participating and can be as easy as telling stories, more and more projects were launched with unreasonable overvaluation. Just like commodity bubbles, ICO bubble stimulates, utilizes, and is fueled by human‚Äôs greed and desire until goes insane at last. When the capital inflow failed to keep up with the fundraising scale, the price of ETH and BTC stopped soaring wildly. People began to come out from the euphoria, some realized the price was on the brink, but most cryptoers were still expecting a higher one.

However, the decline of ETH and BTC price did not affect the ICO market immediately. Some people took it as a regulatory pullback like the one happened in September 2017, they thought the price would recover soon because everyone said the blockchain was the future and everyone had a fear of missing out this express train to the future. Since most ICO project teams also hold tokens as reserve fund, ICO-completed projects did not take the February 2018 price fluctuations seriously due to the consensus that cryptocurrency has high volatility. How to deal with the insufficient capital inflow? Project teams rose token price (by using ETH) to attract retail investors, and then sold token to investors for stablecoins like USDT, making BTC and ETH supportless. The ICO entrustment scam (Entrustee returns fund to entruster if the invested token price rises and sends tokens (which are bought from 2nd market) to entrustee if token price declines) and the unprofitable ICOs triggered the market plummet, BTC and ETH lost 70% of its peak market value after three waves in 6 months. As a result, many well-fundraised public chain projects that were launched in late 2018 joined the stampede sequence after unlocking the fund, hundreds of project teams did rug-pull or lost contact.

At that time, there was no cryptocurrency ETF like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) nor institutional arbitrage in the market. The ICO bubble bursted in the form of the rug-pull of project team or entrusted agent. It was as simple as that of the tulip bubble: all tokens turned out to be air once the ICO package was tore off.

**The Demise of Decentralized Capitalism**

We are experiencing the gradual cognitive breakdown of the cryptocurrency industry, which can be summarized as the demise of decentralized capitalism from Luna and 3AC collapse. Most public chain and stablecoin projects entered the market with vast sums of low-interest capital under the name of decentralization. But once they knew how to print money by themselves, they became primitive people who held fire and pushed token price higher and higher. When they felt they were very close to the holy Mt Olympus of the crypto space, the flames suddenly burned out, a torrential rain destroyed their fire and leverage.

https://preview.redd.it/woe894impy791.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f0159151d7dce1afd15f6028a66de2b214e96e5

In the current cryptocurrency market, the hot sale of art NFT is reminiscent of the Dutch tulip speculation in the 1630s. Just as the financial revolution sparked the speculative frenzy of 1690, and the collapse of the Blington Woods system triggered the modern financial revolution (like stablecoin de-pegging) and led to the bubble economy of the 1980s, economic loosening process can give rise to speculative frenzy easily. The constantly financing and varying DeFi products remind me of the South Sea Bubble in 1720. As long as the capital market is relatively free, fanaticism and infectiousness won‚Äôt have any trouble moving around, while altcoins will make everyone homeless.

**Conclusion:**

Every bubble burst is cruel and despairing, but accompanied by value discovery. While the first bubble confirmed the unsubstitutability of BTC technology, the second made ETH and more blockchain applications widely known, the third bubble enabled us to realize the feasibility of combining decentralized finance and centralized finance. Invest calmly and plan reasonably to go through the bull and bear market, follow 4billionDAO to know more crypto space stories.

We have held two trial elections (the first time we didn't even have a system yet, we only used online document software, but we managed to hold it)

We founded EDAO as a DAO where everyone can participate without complicated KYC, have held 4 consensus meetings, and are trying to experiment fractally. eDAO has done a lot of fundamental work, and in the future hopes to become an important technical outsourcing DAO for the community

In the two trial elections, EdenCN representatives focused on supporting EOSPAPA and e-commerce, EOSPAPA has already achieved 0 cost for EOS account registration and e-commerce will be launched soon.

I use eosauthority to transact with the block chain and have staked 95% of my tokens to CPU with the remaining 5% staked to NET.  I've voted for 21 BPs and haven't seen a single staking reward for months.  I tried staking to a Proxy instead and waited a couple more months - still no staking rewards.  The only rewards I've been able to collect are near negligible returns for lending my tokens to REX (received 0.1 EOS after lending 100% of my tokens to REX for a 2 month period).  But I also noticed that when I lend to REX, it automatically removes my BP votes.  I've since unlended to REX and have re-staked my tokens to CPU/NET at a 95%/5% ratio and re-voted for 21 BPs but I'm still waiting on receipt of a single staking reward.

  
What am I doing wrong and why am I not receiving staking rewards for having my tokens staked and votes allocated to specific BPs?   


Really appreciate the help folks - this is the only project I have had issues with staking.","self","https://redd.it/vobrzg"

The new release will primarily use EOSIO 2.0 as a foundation but, at the same time, will also employ some of the best features first presented in EOSIO 2.1.

The new features would include Configurable WASM Limits, Action Return Values, among other things. One of the most significant driving forces for Mandel is its working group gathering for weekly meetings that seek to lay out the tactics and strategy of further development.

Recently, the Mandel team began testing the D.U.N.E. development environment, released a new patch to enhance subjective billing, and deployed the latest builds on Jungle 4.

The ecosystem can only move forward through the community‚Äôs direct involvement in the development, education, and event organization. [Everstake](https://everstake.one/eos) team has been extensively involved in the working group‚Äôs activities.

In particular, Everstake participates in the Jungle 4 testnet, shares technical and educational materials with the community, and publishes guides exploring the opportunities present in the EOS ecosystem.

In addition, the use of cryptocurrencies is for many an unbridgeable hurdle and are often considered purely speculative objects.

https://preview.redd.it/0haf4tmz7c991.jpg?width=1745&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=119b5a175be410289f00898ad5ce253392d9896c

The upcoming project SavAct changes that. It introduces a system that will provide serious competition to established payment service providers in online commerce. SavAct provides fraud protection that works with any cryptocurrency included in its system while retaining the benefits of the respective cryptocurrency.

# The problem with buyer protection

Third parties are used to protect buyers and sellers from fraud in online commerce. In problem cases, these service providers decide who is in the right and gets to keep the funds. In order to make the fairest possible decision it is necessary that the personal information of the buyer and seller are disclosed. Furthermore, through the integration of a central service provider, there is the possibility to exclude individuals from the payment system. However, the aforementioned points contradict the basic principles of blockchain technology and thus marginalize the advantages over payments with fiat currencies.

# The independent fraud protection

SavAct offers independent fraud protection for payments with cryptocurrencies that does not require a service provider, an intermediary, or an ""oracle"". Thus, for the first time, all the advantages of cryptocurrencies remain unrestricted and the use is as straightforward as a common payment method. Fraud is prevented by the fact that even the attempt to defraud is not profitable.

# SavAct in everyday online commerce

This system is interesting for those who care about the advantages of cryptocurrencies or who want to pay less in online commerce. Established payment services like PayPal and Amazon Pay require a fixed fee and a percentage fee on payments. Since the seller has to pay these fees, the buyer seems not affected. In reality, the buyer pays for the fees because they are ultimately reflected in the selling price.

In contrast, SavAct can be used completely free of charge. Its concept was compared with PayPal and Amazon Pay in a proof of concept. The result was a cost saving of up to 78 percent. SavAct also enables fraud prevention for micro-payments by eliminating fixed fees. This is especially true for cheaper items. For example, an item that costs $0.75 and previously yielded 20 percent profit for the retailer would yield 67 percent profit with SavAct. In this scenario the profit would be more than tripled, which would be especially interesting for Asian traders who export to Western countries.

The cost savings can be used to lower the sales price and thus increase sales figures. On the other hand, cheaper item prices incentivises groups of people to use cryptocurrencies, who might usually not be interested in this technology.

# State of the art

The technology has been submitted for patent and will initially be implemented on EOSIO blockchains. This blockchain technology was chosen for the first implementation to offer a competitive and environmentally friendly payment method as soon as possible and without the need of transaction costs. The implementation of other blockchains will follow, including Ethereum, Cardano and Bitcoin. It will be up to the users which cryptocurrency they want to use with SavAct.

Some first unit tests were all successful. This is another major milestone for the project. ZEOS might be the very first crypto project to adopt Halo 2 expanding Zcash Orchard's action circuit to support EOSIO token symbols, NFTs and Auth tokens. The arithmetic circuit is the most critical part of the entire protocol. All functionality under the chapter 'The Protocol' in the whitepaper is based on this one circuit. Now that it is complete we can already move on to build another demo application on Kylin. This app is going to demonstrate the feature complete protocol as presented in the paper. After that we can plan the mainnet rollout.""

The #EOS cryptocurrency has seen its 24 hour trading volume jump to $454,000,000, which is a 36.05% gain! https://t.co/YtI5MNK9rQ","self","https://redd.it/wdij69"
"wdk04p","eos","estebansaa",1659367061,1659437940,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"TrustSwap.finance is the first DEFI 3.0 exchange!","EOS DeFi",1.0,11,0,1,3,0,"So what is [TrustSwap.finance](https://TrustSwap.finance) and what is DEFI 3.0 ?

Let‚Äôs start with what the swap market is today, one of the most popular ‚ÄúSwaps‚Äù today is Uniswap, a decentralized smart contract that runs on Ethereum and other chains, and then there is Sushiswap also and Pancakeswap, these last two are forks or clones of Uniswap, and they made a few changes to the economics of Uniswap, mainly a unlimited inflation on their governance token.  And there are lots of other forks of this smart contracts, mainly of Sushiswap and Pancake swap, that is all these projects, **have unlimited inflation on their governance token. And its token value it all comes from governance, there is no other use of their beyond that.**

After discovering Trust EVM, and seeing how well organized the community behind EOS was, I said ok, we have to go beyond the tests that we were doing and bring something that leverages all these amazing tools. And a Swap is the tool that  made the most sense. So we said, ok let's bring a swap, but let's not fork Sushiswap or Pancakeswap, let's fork Uniswap and keep the same limited inflation economics. And then let's bring in something great from Sushiswap and Pancakeswap, that is give our governance token away in exchange for users adding liquidity. And so we have this idea of distributing our tokens to those providing liquidity, but with the big difference that unlike Sushiswap and Pancakeswap there is a hard limit on the number of tokens from day 1. And that is all working TODAY on the Trust EVM testnet, as we eagerly await for mainnet launch.

And then we shared these ideas inside the community,  everyone was very welcoming,  we got feedback on the token, and **a challenge!** So we have this token at the center of TrustSwap incentive model, but we need to find ways to give it value beyond governance, beyond what Uniswap, Sushiswap and Pancakeswap are doing. Take things a step further forward.  And we discussed a few ideas,  some of them contentious!, And then we hear about these two amazing papers that change everything! the Yield+ and Recover+ papers, and we saw how they fit right into our plans.

I don't want to give too many details, so this doesn't get that long. But basically EOS Yield+ project, means that we are able to create a sustainable yield for our token beyond governance. While other projects are looking for solutions to a death spiral caused by inflation, we have  one ready. We are certain that we can leverage the Yield+ incentives in such a way that we can create a token that continues to increases in value, being scarce and being useful. Sustainable growth! It is worth repeating **DEFI 3.0 means we are a step ahead of everyone else**.

And then we have Recover+, and this is yet another great incentive for users to prefer trading with us, because we can offer trading with less risk. Again I don't want to go into details, but if you haven't read check the papers [https://eosnetwork.com/blog/eos-yield-blue-paper/](https://eosnetwork.com/blog/eos-yield-blue-paper/)  and [https://eosnetwork.com/blog/recover-blue-paper/](https://eosnetwork.com/blog/recover-blue-paper/), they contain lots of valuable information and will give you a clear idea of what we are building.

And so we can finally answer what **TrustSwap.finance** is, **TrustSwap is the DEFI 3.0 exchange for the next Billion of users!** result of a series of incentives of our underlying platforms. Big plans right, and this also means that while we are being bootstrapped by leveraging the EOS ecosystem tools, our plans go further. We aim to grow to the point where we become a reason for users that are outside of the ecosystem to join.

We are still in the early days, in the 90s of the Internet if you will. Before Billions of people had the internet in their pocket. And then there is this big switch of people using centralized exchanges, into decentralized finance, and so we are a door to DEFI 3.0 on EOS. People that are moving from centralized exchanges, they don't care about what type of server the service is running right? They don't care if the servers run Windows or Linux, what they care about is their funds being safe, the fees being low, having enough liquidity, good pairing of tokens, and also the information necessary to find the good tokens, to find the token that is about to go up 10x and 100X, and that is some of the things we want to answer in our project.

And so that is what we are building, we are leveraging all these tools, Trust EVM, Yield+, Recover+, to create a platform that gets the attention of everyone,  those moving away from centralized exchanges. And so we are in the early days of crypto, and the early days of DEFI, yet we are already one step ahead of what other decentralized services are offering.

We are taking this step by step, we have a working system on testnet, and preparing things for mainnet. We want to have solved our contract security, and for this we have security audits on the way. The ENF is helping us, and that is a great incentive that motivate us to move forward and put all this energy into, **but we also need help from the community, our Pomelo is active now and we are looking to get funds to cover our security contract audits**, and so here is a call for your support! We really want to build and have a positive impact on the ecosystem, and so we can't do this alone, we need the community support to achieve these goals.

This can be cumbersome for the average user when they come to the DeFi space and see all these potential places where they can earn interest rates, which are much higher than what they can find in traditional finance.

With that in mind we wanted to create a yield aggregator, a place where you can deposit your assets and easily find the best interest rate for them.

Currently that‚Äôs through Alpaca Finance but there will be more vaults added in the future. Gym Network is a fully decentralized protocol operating on the Binance Smart Chain. We offer you innovative solutions to make your DeFi harvest as profitable as possible.

Your safety is of utmost importance to us.

Gym Network is completely decentralized, meaning you are your own boss here. It is connected directly to your wallet so that you remain in complete control over your assets. All transactions within our protocol are monitored through the external audits of Certik and Peckshield.

We boast a strong community with 25,000+ active members worldwide. The key to attracting massive audiences for us is regularly coming up with big surprises. Discover our Gitbook and learn more about Gym Network. Many more features are yet to come!

Stay tuned and gear up for the take-off

God was first called Logos.  Is this evidence of the first international teaching system?  The Sri Yantra looks like a gyroscopic instrumentation drawing‚Ä¶. Is the idea of the US Constitution really recent?  Could it stretch back to a time of a high tech global civilisation?  Of the Byzantine Era for example?  Have we been spoonfeed lots of fake science and fake news?

I found a code.  It‚Äôs not that complicated.  When applied to just about anything it seems to Devine the truth.  Names and words have been changed to hide this code!  I was encouraged to make further changes!  Unfortunately for those, time is running out!  No further changes, only improvements!!!

I am going to suggest an alternative way of understanding science.  One that is logical and in my opinion the traditional way to work things out!  I found a key and it works!  It‚Äôs magical!  This key expands into an incredible discovery.  Is the original Quantum Mechanics inspired ‚Äútheory of everything‚Äù hidden on our Periodic Table of Elements?  I think it is.

Education is lacking in much teaching about static and piezo electricity.  For the last hundred years we see smoke and daggers surrounding H2O and HHO.  What if there is much more to this?  A missed out bit of chemistry?  It turns out there is, and it improves science at the same time, combining it with a few traditional electrical phenomena.

Our host rock for Gold (Au) is Quartz, comprising Si - Silica and O2 - Oxygen.  Quartz is famous for generating piezoelectricity.  Is a process known as dissociation of oxygen the missing link to Harry Potter style Alchemy?  I think it is!  

Our Laws of Physics are incorrect.  Is easy to win this argument in a Physics lab nowadays!  Why is this so?   Not only did I find the answer I think I also found the original obscured masterpieces of work!

Our ancient history is much better preserved than we care to imagine, and I can show you!

Based on all of this information, Phigroup.io are launching coins on the Binance Smart Chain - RX BEP20 and via EOS for a number of countries worldwide.  We have technology we need to develop and understand.  Technology that has a chance to change our future and break us from our dependence on fossil fuels!  Free energy technology, even promise of new forms of Aviation technology, a fuel-less one!  Promising much fresher air!

This Davinchi Code is great!  It answers all the questions!  I think it was originally the reason people lived hundreds of years in the bible!  Changed by chemists and lost to the doctors, it hides incredible secrets and more incredible history!  I think this should really swap it name, something like the Devine Chi Code or the Good Life or La Dolce Vita perhaps?  Like an ancient relationship of everything.

Free electricity 
Anti gravity
Synthetic telepathy 
Key to manufacturing a language 

This key improves most degrees at University level - for example outlining Reams Theory of Biological Ionisation as the ultimate human physiology theory.  Understanding this key improves our nutrition secrets to - indicating good and dangerous.  Notes in the code are left in names for indication.  Likewise I have found evidence of Geology featuring in shorthand in Geographical place names!  Remarkable indeed indicating ancient global geological mapping!  I wondered how Cargill and Glencore and Blackrock and de beers among others achieved their amazing successes, monopolising mineral resources and agriculture and refining technology etc.  gmo pushed in for good measure!

Phi Group has launched RX Unity Coin on the Binance Smart Chain and are about to launch another with EOS, with several ambitious roadmaps!  Some already featuring in the government and news as suggested regional developments!  The North East Essex Gardens Project being just one of these!


Please support our work by buying our RX BEP20 ‚ÄúUnity Coin‚Äù as one of our utility coins you can use, to pool together for various projects worldwide and in the U.K.   Tesla technology, water technology, Aquaculture and Agriculture are our backgrounds.  We are here to observe and conserve and improve all businesses we can with our new and improved technological understanding!  Please invest in Phigroup.io and join one of our channels on Telegram, Discord or Twitter!  Thank you!

The Davinchi Code or the Devine Chi Code is the reason for the Sphinx name and significant to our history!  It is also the key to all modern languages!  It is also the fake news code!

ChainsAtlas  is a new blockchain technology that leverages virtualization and multiple distributed ledger technologies with a smart contract feature  to create a cross-chain decentralized homogeneous network for     distributed software and data processing.

ChainsAtlas use a dual consensus protocol, *Proof-of-Stake* (PoS) and a novel class of useful *Proof-of-Work* (PoW), called **Proof-of-Strategy**  (PoSg). In the context of PoSg, strategists provide the optimal     execution strategy for a given bytecode under a variable set of  constraints, and they operate nodes called Pythians that validate those   strategies. With PoS, Pythians enable cross-chains communication and  provide constant updates on the supported blockchains state.

ChainsAtlas runs on top of the other widely used blockchains and smart contract platforms, and defines new concepts, such as :

**Distributed Decentralized Processing Network**  
**Proof of Strategy**  
**Management units**  
**Virtualization units**

We hope you find it intriguing, for any suggestions or comments, please reach out.

We believe it would be beneficial to the eosio ecosystem to extend the library to attract many developers that are learning to program and using python. Additionally, some education entities are switching long time used languages to python in their introductory courses, this would lead to even a greater popularity of python among the new generation of programmers.

With initiatives like Eden and EdenFractal EOS is in a lot of ways ahead of the game. The only thing lacking is some real power that these communities could gain in on-chain governance (BP selection) of EOS. Albedo project provides a vision for how to achieve this missing piece, without requiring any changes to the current governance model of EOS. If EOS were able to achieve this, it would be something unprecedented in the crypto space: the first chain where users and developers gain a significant voice in on-chain governance, in a credibly-neutral way. Not to mention the benefits in decentralization, this would also enable EOS community to direct network funds more effectively towards those who bring value to the network.

**EOS hard fork to Antelope.io Leap 3.1 on the 21. of September 2022** 

Node operators have to upgrade their nodes before September 21 to continue syncing with the network. 

End users don't need to do anything.  There is no hard fork of the EOS Blockchain. It¬¥s a fork of the underlying codebase.   

$EOS stays $EOS

EOS Network Foundation Members Switch Support to Crypto Protocol Antelope After Hard Fork. Once the split takes place, the protocol will be led by a coalition connected to the EOS Network Foundation, following the foundation‚Äôs separation from Block.one.

Antelope is an open framework blockchain and a community-run codebase. It uses a Delegated Proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus model, which evolved from proof-of-stake, where users of the network vote and elect delegates to validate the next block. Under DPoS, delegates are referred to as block producers.

Developers use Antelope for a diverse range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) and supply chain management to non-fungible tokens (NFT) and games. The Antelope Coalition has already made Requests for Proposals, including proposals addressing faster finality, software development kits (SKDs), and peer-to-peer code improvements.

I feel like EOS will be a major contender in the Web3 space and draw some major companies, institutions and organizations to develop on EOS. I read a research paper recently out of the patent industry (U.S.) comparing a few blockchains the industry was thinking of developing on - specifically, enabling inventors to patent their inventions via NFTs. EOS was amongst a fee others which included file token, algarand, eth and Flow token.

The **EOS Leap 3.1.0 consensus upgrade** (hard fork) is planned for Sept 21, 13:00 UTC! EOS BPs are continuing to update their nodes to Leap 3.1. The status can be tracked [here](https://github.com/orgs/EOS-Nation/projects/3/views/9).

[@AntelopeIO](https://twitter.com/AntelopeIO) is not a new blockchain, and it doesn't come with a new token. **Antelope** is a fork (copy) of EOSIO 2.0 (the previous codebase that powered EOS and sister blockchains). Antelope codebase will power EOS and some of its sister blockchains.

**What are the main fork advantages?** The EOS consensus upgrade will enable:

üí† Introduction of Faster Finality.

üí† Trustless Inter-Blockchain Communication between all Antelope-based blockchains.

üí† A robust suite of Secure Smart Contract Libraries, SDKs, P2P Code Improvements.

üí† Game-changing tools & innovations.

We have proven that this decentralized system is powerful enough to pursue justice entirely within our own self-sovereignty. A multi-billion dollar company with teams of high-powered lawyers could only watch helplessly as the network they helped build emancipated itself from under their neglectful yoke.

Meanwhile the network itself has, through consensus, taken the reins of its own destiny. The Antelope coalition allows the EOS community and the wider Antelope ecosystem to guide development of the protocol according to community priorities, without having to ask risk-averse corporate lawyers for permission. This has already rapidly accelerated development, delivering long-promised features like IBC and a highly performant EVM in a matter of months, after years of empty promises. We have some of the best engineers in the business, and their passion shines through in the quality of their work.

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that we can create our own money; that with it, we can design our own logically consistent economic systems; and that by doing so, we can challenge the supremacy of illegitimate power, by creating our own systems  that peacefully outcompete the broken incentives structures into irrelevance. We now have the power to reshape industries one-by-one, and banish the rent-seekers who extract value without adding any. And now, on EOS's day of independence, we have the community to do it.","self","https://redd.it/xkf1q9"

The game's UPX token is not tradeable outside of the game (you buy it with USD in-game) so even if the demand increases for it, I don't see how it increases the demand for EOS. Likewise, you can sell the NFT properties for USD, but again this seems completely divorced from the EOS economy. 

By contrast, a game like Splinterlands encourages you to buy HIVE so that you can trade it for the game's DEC and SPS tokens. Hypothetically, if Uplands takes the world by storm and gets millions of active players, will that help increase the price or adoption of EOS even a little bit?","self","https://redd.it/xo8pi8"

As for now, let's recap some of the most recent news üì∑ 

&#x200B;

1. In case you've missed the big news - on September 21st, EOS declared Independence With Antelope Leap 3.1 Consensus Upgrade. üéâ You can find out more about it in this [article](https://bywire.news/articles/eos-declares-independence-with-antelope-leap-31-consensus-upgrade) by Bywire News.

&#x200B;

3.  Be aware of the EOS scam! üõë There have been 2 scam cases recently, check the information on them, so you won't become their victim: [Post about migration to EOS v3](https://help.eossupport.io/en/articles/6004303-new-scam-update-to-eos-version-3) and a [fake Facebook group posing as ""EOS Network""](https://help.eossupport.io/en/articles/5770388-scam-official-eos-social-media-groups-please-report-them).

&#x200B;

4.  [Antelope Coalition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7asilevMdGo&ab_channel=EOSNetworkFoundation) is up!

Anyways. To the main question, on KuCoin I traded 12$ Usdt to Eos, but then when I checked my trading account it said 9$ in Eos, simply put 3$ just disappeared I guess?

I already claimed my own NFT pack and I must say my luck was pretty decent, I got the 84 rated Richarlison NFT, which should be worth a decent amoung of $$$ since he performed so well in the last games.

But imagine you claim your own NFT Pack and get extremely lucky with a Messi or Ronaldo NFT, holy shit I can't even imagine how much they will be worth. And the best thing is, it doesn't stop right there, the World Cup is filled with the greatest players such as Mbappe, Lewandowski, Benzema, Neymar etc. etc. and there are only 1000 available right now, which seems to be a trend with many brands at the moment, so claim yours before they are gone.

I'm holding onto my Richarlison for sure, because I think he will perform just as great in Brazil's upcoming games and his value should increase as well, which, again, is purely logical the way the crypto and NFT market works.","self","https://redd.it/z6dxpi"

A: EOS is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and scale decentralized applications (dApps). EOS is known for its high-performance capabilities and ability to handle large amounts of transactions, making it a popular choice among developers and users of dApps.

EOS was founded by Dan Larimer, who also founded the decentralized exchange platform BitShares and the blockchain platform Steemit. Larimer designed EOS to address some of the scalability and performance challenges that had limited the adoption of other blockchain platforms.

One of the key features of EOS is its use of a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. This algorithm allows EOS to achieve high transaction speeds and scalability by allowing token holders to vote for a limited number of ""block producers"" who validate transactions and maintain the network. This approach allows EOS to achieve high performance without sacrificing decentralization, unlike some other high-performance blockchain platforms that use more centralized approaches.

EOS also includes a number of other features that make it attractive to developers and users of dApps. For example, EOS includes a built-in token system that allows dApps to create and use their own tokens, which can be used to power their applications and incentivize user participation. Additionally, EOS provides a web assembly (WASM) virtual machine that allows developers to write dApps in a variety of programming languages, making it easier for them to build and deploy their applications.

Since its launch in 2018, EOS has become one of the most popular and widely-used blockchain platforms for dApps. As of December 2022, EOS has a market capitalization of over $12 billion, making it one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Additionally, the EOS network has processed over 1.5 billion transactions, making it one of the most active and widely-used blockchain platforms.

EOS has also attracted a large and active community of developers and users, who are building and using a wide range of dApps on the platform. Some of the most popular dApps on EOS include games, social media platforms, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. This strong ecosystem of dApps and users has helped drive adoption and growth for EOS, and it is likely to continue to support the platform in the future.

Looking ahead, the future of EOS is bright. The platform's high-performance capabilities and strong ecosystem of dApps and users make it well-positioned to continue to grow and gain market share in the competitive world of blockchain and decentralized applications. While there are challenges and uncertainties in the broader crypto and blockchain space, EOS has a strong foundation and track record that suggest it is well-positioned to continue to be a major player in the space.","self","https://redd.it/zdqjnv"

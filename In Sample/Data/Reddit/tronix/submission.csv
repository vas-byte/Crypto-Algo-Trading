There's too much risk and undermines the virtues of decentralization.

The best way encourage migration and investment into the TRON blockchain is by dispersing to the public, locking up (for a very long time), and/or burning these funds. These funds need to be utilized in a way that benefits the community, not a small handful of investors.

Otherwise, the TRON blockchain will never realize its full potential.

There was a kick-ass Wolverinu advertisement on Times Square, saw it when passing by. It could‚Äôve totally slipped me though as I was pre-occupied with other stuff. But a bit later while getting coffee I overheard a guy with a flyer that looked like the ad from earlier talking about Shiba Inu‚Äôs designer being involved and remembered. Noticed there were flyers in the area and picked one up and put it in my pocket. It led to some conversation and quick research about Wolverinu during a couple of drinks with some people I‚Äôd met up with that night hahaha.
Got amped about it very quickly.
Very glad I got in since then, imo the projects‚Äô achievements and dedication to quality speak for itself.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community. With this site is also possible to direct withdraw to coinbase for BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, DOGE, ADA, ATOM, ALGO, BAT, EOS, LINK, XLM, XTZ, XRP

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock","self","https://redd.it/rwkt8q"

Sounds like they are working towards Tron's success being out of the direct hands of Justin Sun and the Tron Foundation, which I feel like it was in the past.    I like this new direction.   

It will be interesting to see how things develop into the future.     

I like that it is possible to increase ones stack through voting/staking.

It is also interesting to see Tron continue in a deflationary state:

"rx7fz4","tronix","provoko",1641449491,1641520160,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"best strategy for TRON DeFi right now - 13% APY","Tutorial",0.87,12,0,0,12,0,"No matter a crypto or stock market crash, best thing you can do is have a large bag of stablecoins that equal 1 but also earning you APY.

This strategy is a conservative one **earning around 12% to 13% APY** depending on how much you borrow against your stablecoins.

**Basically** you supply stablecoins to a lending platform like JustLend to earn APY off the stablecoins, then borrow TRX at low APYs, then staking the TRX to vote & earn voter rewards (more APY).

Starting with USDJ, being backed by 1.2 billion dollars worth, also gets the highest APY on JustLend.

USDJ can also be swapped for USDT on sun io with virtually no slippage just in case you need the money by sending it to an exchange like Binance or Kraken.

Then borrow TRX on JustLend, around 50% or more against your USDJ supply. 

Then stake TRX by freezing for resources (energy or bandwidth) and then vote for an SR.

Lastly sell the JST rewards from JustLend for TRX or USDJ and supply it on JustLend, that includes the TRX rewards from voting, and **keep your borrow % around 50%** but you can go higher or lower depending on how aggressive you want to be without getting liquidated.

And that's it, your net APY will be between 12 to 13%.  Sometimes rates go up, as long as borrowers are borrowing then the rates go up, sometimes TUSD or USDT have the highest rates.

**Maintenance**

* If TRX falls in price, borrow more TRX to get borrowing % back to 50% and vote more  
* If TRX rises, unstake TRX (only frozen for 3 days) and repay your loan on justlend to get the % back to 50% borrowed

What might help managing the above is to freeze some TRX for bandwidth and some for energy as that will allow you to unstake (unfreeze) twice in a row within a 3 day period as freezing TRX locks it for 3 days minimum.  You might need to unstake within 3 days to quickly repay your TRX loan on JustLend in the event TRX spikes in price, but you don't really have to do this if you're borrowing less than 60% or even 70%.

**stablecoin only strategy**

An extremely conservative strategy where **you don't lose money would be 100% stablescoins** on JustLend, that's because your stablecoin always equals 1, especially ever since sun io came along on TRON; sun io lets you swap any stablecoin for another stablecoin for nearly 0 slippage and only 1 stablecoin fee.  Coupled with being able to unstake the TRX from voting and repaying your loan, essentially if you borrow 1 trx and stake it, you can unstake 1 trx and repay it, so you never lose the coin you borrowed.

**Rewards**

Don't wait to sell your JST or use your TRX voting rewards as a bear market will drop the value of these tokens.

Although, you could keep a portion of the JST/TRX as a way to invest in those:

**The fact that TRON blockchain has one of the highest paying staking platforms and TRX supply is now deflationary for the last 60 days straight** with fast transactions and low fees, tron's value proposition is there.

A tweak to the reward strategy:  You sell the JST for TRX and with your TRX voter rewards, you use to repay the TRX loan.  At a certain point you paid off your loan and you keep all the TRX you borrowed and still have all the stablecoins you started with.  But this shouldn't be your goal because you're always borrowing or repaying your loan based on TRX price swings.

If you're really conservative/risk-adverse, then you sell JST for USDJ & sell TRX rewards for USDJ and just grow the stablecoins portion only.  You could even buy USDC or TUSD with your rewards.

That's all, I wanted to share this strategy as I don't think it's widely known.  It also allows you to get a ton of energy for gaming or other transactions on TRON.  Let me know if you have any questions.","self","https://redd.it/rx7fz4"

Is there any way I can do this right now?

When I head to Sunswap, there is a ridiculous [94% fee](https://imgur.com/a/tQ10SVh).

This can't be right - I thought all assets in the Tron family traded with each other very inexpensively.  Someone else checked and had a 33% fee, and another person did the same with a 49% fee.  Why the variability and why the unfathomable fees?

Any help?  I'd happily trade for USDT to go buy TRX as well.

Edit:  I have been permabanned on the BTT subreddit for asking this same question.  I appreciate all the help found over here.  Have a great weekend, everyone.

Edit 2:  Now that my question has been answered, here's a second question:  Someone suggested something big might be coming to BTT - hence why this Old to New swap is now occurring.  Is the general consensus among the community that this change required the technical swap for significant new functionality (eg. Upgrade) - or is there any other prevailing thought to why the devs would expend such an effort for a massive technical process?","self","https://redd.it/s4kqso"

Tron Link is browser extension, which seems insecure to me. What if another browser extension spies on it? I don't trust JavaScript with all my life's savings.

So I don't usually do this but I'm freaking in love with this project called [JUSTMONEY.IO](https://JUSTMONEY.IO). 

Really recommend people have a look at this project. The short of it:

**What is it:** A project to build the next-gen payment infrastructure for web3.0. They use a deflationary token called JM.  For every transaction, a 3% fee is taken and, distributed between the existing token owner's rewards in JM and part of this is burned forever.   


So far they've burned 73,890,000 JM tokens.  


**What do they do:** At the moment the key thing is the DEX ([https://tron.justmoney.exchange](https://tron.justmoney.exchange/)). 

Basically an alternative to SunSwap. Given my dislike of how the three biggest apps on Tron (JustLend, Sun, Sunswap) were all created by Justin Sun, supporting projects like this means a healthier ecosystem.   


**The team:** So I've been following their Telegram for ages. The devs are super responsive, intelligent and so far hit every major milestone promised. Check it out if you don't believe me ([https://t.me/JustMoneyTRX](https://t.me/JustMoneyTRX)), but it is worthwhile joining. 

Anyway DYOR but do yourself a favour and at least visit their site (takes 10 seconds) and check it out or chat to the team on telegram.","self","https://redd.it/spqeou"

I recently changed phone, where i was using ""TronWallet"" app. I thought i was quite diligent in using the ""backup wallet"" feature, which has given me the primary key and 12 seed words.  


On my new phone, i have restored the wallet, i can see the wallet in the app as the main account, however it is showing ""0 TRX"".   


Checking the wallet ID online, the linked wallet is showing the expected TRX sitting there.  


Can anyone please advise what i may be doing wrong?","self","https://redd.it/t066sk"

We are very excited about our participation in the first 2022 Hackathon event. USTX project is growing in functionality and utility every day, but we want to keep going and expand our userbase further. The main milestones for the event will be the **Voting platform** and the **Crosschain bridge**.

This is the planned roadmap for the hackathon and the following months:

* Mar 13, 2022: Start of Hackathon, USTX participation will be shared on all our social media accounts. The front-end design will be finalized and deployed. Work on smart contracts ongoing.
* Mar 20, 2022: Voting smart contract deployed on Nile testnet. Integration with front-end and testing continues.
* Mar 27, 2022: Voting smart contracts are deployed on mainnet. Final testing takes place.
* Mar 31, 2022: The voting and governance portal is officially active and the first proposition will take place: which is the next blockchain USTX should launch on?
* Apr 13, 2022: Voting results are available. Cross-chain bridge contracts are deployed on testnets and a first version of the dApp is released for testing. Community testnet and bug bounty programs are launched.
* Apr 30, 2022: Complete dApp is released and smart contracts are deployed on mainnet. Real life testing begins.
* May 13, 2022: End of Hackathon one. The cross-chain bridge is officially available to users.
* June, 2022: The first cross-launch event takes place on USTX Cross-launchpad. Liquidity is raised for listing, marketing and buyback.
* August, 2022: Staking will be available on all blockchains where USTX is present, as an incentive to holding and keep TVL around 75%.
* Dec 31, 2022: By the end of the year, we plan to have USTX launched and listed on at least other 3 blockchains. A first redesign of the dApps and website will be done. More partnerships will be defined. 

There are a lot of great projects participating and we believe this is a great opportunity to make a tangible effort in the growth of Tron ecosystem.

So I tested [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) and wanted to make my own opinion about it:

Crypto.com offers Visa debit cards that give 2% cashback and a range of other perks like free Spotify. This is a very big company. Recently [they started a huge ad campaign starring Matt Damon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8) and they [bought the naming rights to the Staples Center in L.A. for 20 years](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-16/crypto-staples).

The Ruby Steel card tier offers a **$25 instant bonus, free Spotify and 2% cashback on all purchases,** and a premium metal card. To get the card you need to stake ‚Ç¨350 worth of CRO coins and hold it for 6 months. After this time you're free to sell them again (or keep if you want to retain the card benefits).

**Important note:** you don't need to put crypto on the card, you can just load it with Euro or USD and spend it!

All cashbacks and bonuses are paid in the CRO cryptocurrency. You can immediately sell the CRO in the app for pounds/euros, which you can use again for purchases with the card if you want.

\--

**Personal experience:**

I've been using the card for two months now. Lost a small amount as CRO dipped a bit and my staked amount is worth less than before. Yet I got on all purchases a 2% cashback which is currently worth $21 (over all purchases were $1050). I use the card on a regular base but I don't have many running costs. In these two months my Spotify got paid back in CRO ($12.99 each month) and I started staking my CRO on their DeFi Wallet with a 12.58% annual reward.

Also the metal debit card looks awesome :)

* Verify your identity
* Purchase and stake ‚Ç¨350 worth of CRO for the Ruby Steel card tier
* The $25 referral bonus will be credited instantly after you've staked for the card and you can sell it for pounds/euros straight away if you want.
* After your card has been delivered, be sure to set it as the payment method for Spotify so that the 100% rebate can be processed automatically.","self","https://redd.it/t9nptv"

I originally met him on the Loopring Discord Server and we talked a lot about how he has worked with ADA NFT projects like Tiger Society, Billionaire Bears Club and Lazy Llamas. I did some sleuthing and found out that he did work for Tiger Society, but getting a hold of the individuals in the other two NFT projects came up with nothing. Here is a twitter thread I made to help those in need to see that he actually IS a scammer. He was going to do 'The Loopring War: Pirates VS. Aliens' and had a discord setup and everything. He was shilling his project in the Loopring discord and we weren't having it, so me and a few fellow Loopring lovers decided to take it into our own hands and investigate. This is what we came up with.

BrianFerrari360 is his old account (This is private now on Twitter) but BrianLRC was his name for the LRC NFT Project and actually created the @ LRCNFT name on Twitter. See my thread below. If you have any questions, please let me know. Also, please let me know if you find this individual on other blockchains so we can completely rid the crypto community of him. Thanks!

Cake Defi is a decentralized finance platform based in Singapore, utilising the Defichain blockchain which is secured by anchoring with the btc blockchain. Cake Defi offer a very generous $30 sign-up bonus, paid instantly as DFI (Defichain), for anybody who deposits $50. This does not require any additional transactions or trades, just **a deposit which you will be able to instantly withdraw** if you need to.

Cake Defi is currently best accessed via the website, although mobile applications are being developed and are currently undergoing beta testing.

[Referral-Link to get the $30 Bonus](https://app.cakedefi.com/?ref=571562)

[Non-Ref Link (no Bonus)](https://app.cakedefi.com/)

1. Sign-up to Cake Defi using the referral link and ensure that there is the information: *""Referral code has been applied* ***571562***\*""\* to ensure you receive the bonus.
2. Verify your identity using photo ID. This used to take up to 72 hours, but should be much faster for most of the time.
3. *Deposit $50*. There is a limited number of currencies that can be used and if you are planning to withdraw your deposit instantly I would strongly recommend DASH as it has the lowest withdrawal fees. Bitcoin Cash has the next lowest withdrawal fee, followed by Doge and then Litecoin. I suggest checking the withdrawal fee page before signing up to see which suits you best.
4. Once your deposit has been received, your *sign-up bonus of $30* will be paid into your account instantly. This will be staked and locked for 180 days however it does earn interest during that time, currently around **35% APY!** Go to the freezer section and turn off auto-renew if you will want to withdraw after 180 days.
5. The DASH, or whatever you deposited, can be immediately withdrawn to wherever it was deposited from and if necessary, exchanged to GBP and withdrawn to your bank account.
6. After 180 days, withdraw your bonus along with the interest it has accrued. Obviously you are able to do Liquidity Mining on CakeDefi.
7. Do the Learn Lesson and get another $5 of DFI.

I have been really impressed with Cake and Defichain as a whole. I invested a bit more than the $50 and due to Liquidity Mining it already gave a nice bonus which I really apprechiate. I am now using the Freezer on Cake Defi to stake more DFI over a much longer timeframe than the initial 6 months as the APY is fantastic, the longer timeframes gives discounts on fees and I can see the value of the coin appreciating over the next few years.

Cake do have other opportunities to earn interest on your crypto using their liquidity pools or via lending. BTC, ETH, BCH, DOGE, LTC and USDT all have good APRs, just keep an eye on the withdrawal fees for BTC, ETH and USDT to ensure you stake enough or for long enough to make it worth your while.

For anybody struggling with buying DASH, it can be purchased at Bitpanda as previously mentioned, but also Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex and Kucoin. Deposit/withdrawal fees and methods across these exchanges vary.

While other crypto wallets require me to use a seed phrase, with ZenGo, I didn't get any passwords or seed phrases which is strange.

\-------------------  
   Reddit answer to upvote:  
\-------------------  
   ZenGo uses your biometric data (fingerprint) to encrypt a key (password) which, half of it is on your phone and backup on cloud services, and the other half of the password is stored on ZenGo's server.  
In this way, no one besides you can control your crypto, but at the same time, your wallet is also recoverable, unlike cold wallets, which do not provide any backup if the password is lost.  
Being in charge of your own ""cold"" crypto wallet security comes with great responsibility, and human error could lead to theft or accidental deletion.

   By using their wallet, you remove the need for a password, so you can never lose it, and you can never fall into phishing scams or any other password theft hacks that ask for your private key.

   This is enabled by using a unique security model called MPC (Multi-Party Computation), which keeps the user's data hidden from the provider.  
ZenGo describes their security model in depth here: [https://zengo.com/security/](https://zengo.com/security/).","self","https://redd.it/texzu3"

Launched almost a year ago, Liveminertoken set out to deliver an unique experiment **exclusive** on the Tron chain. 

Responsible for more than 20K new users to the Tron chain in months, learning their way around Sunswap and sticking with the best cryptocurrency we all know and love! (Thats Tron yo)

Liveminertoken is an app on Google play that allowed anyone - anywhere with an internet connection to mine blocks by hand and earn blockrewards. This concept is unique to Liveminertoken.

This app offers an aspect never seen before. Instead of using KYC, passport verifications and the likes LMT allows you to trade your time in return for LMT tokens (issued on TRX chain). 

You heard that right. Not a game, not a simple dapp, nothing similar. 

It works roughly like this;

Draw on a board, the drawing gets hashed against an algorithm and when the outcome matched the hash, you earn the reward. If this process confuses you (I know it did for me!) you can check out the process on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/tNEynggTryA).

This proces is done to ensure anyone anywhere can use the app with no restrictions as long as they can access internet. 


Later on, LMT will have built in NFT galleries, staking and much more. All inside an easy to use application so people get an simple introduction to cryptocurrency and play around with Tron. 


NFTs wont be just any images, you will only be able to mint drawings you made in the app. This ensures that all NFTs made will be 100% user generated and have a certain element of difficulty. 


I wanted to share a light on this project because albeit it is small compared to some projects, they work hard to deliver a good experience. 


The app has been up for almost a year, with 24/7 support available and weekly updates which is amazing in my opinion from a small team. Sidenote, team never sold a single token in a year since the start. 

Feel free to look it up on Google play. lmt has a 5 star rating!

I'm having a hard time finding any reports of this migration smart contract working without issue for anyone.  I'm just wondering if anyone can confirm they've done it and had no issues.  Was it as easy as the guide makes it seem?

Also, it implies you don't need a new wallet or anything.  Does that mean the address stays the same and I don't need to set anything new up when coming from MEW?  Just send everything to that address and wait?  


Trying to play it safe here since the guide also says to send **everything** at once which doesn't allow for a small test conversion.

I want to explore various ideas for expanding the use of crypto as a payment method, so my team and I are building a service called [http://metamouse.cc/](http://metamouse.cc/)

. It allows you to spend crypto to pay invoices for goods or services using bank transfers. It works like this:

1. You submit the information of the payment you want to make;
2. Send the crypto to the designated address;
3. We, or one of our partners, execute the bank transfer in your stead.
4. You receive a confirmation once the payment is made.

In the future, we want to experiment with a p2p model, where our platform can connect people, who want to make payments with crypto, with people, who can make bank transfers in exchange for a portion of a fee.

I stocked up on energy and bandwidth to perform operations on the blockchain and I believe it is one of the strongest use cases for TRON. Staking for energy/bandwidth is almost like a redeemable entry ticket to be able to access Tron‚Äôs network and DEFI services. Basically you put up the funds and earn as well, and TRON gains TVL, network strength, and gives access to their services. 

The problem though, is that aside from being able to stake and move funds around, there is not much else you can do with the E/B. 

It would be perfect if we could mint NFTs with energy and bandwidth and not have to burn TRX. It would incentivize people to buy, stake and hold TRX so they could mint NFTs in a cost efficient way. Development on TRON would benefit because game developers could front the energy and bandwidth costs of minting Gamefi NFTs for their users. It would be the perfect blockchain for Gamefi because of the energy/bandwidth mechanism.

I think the best candidate for the marketplace would be on BTT‚Äôs NFTHub which is built upon the BTFS Network. If the marketplace/storage center were built on the BTFS network then the NFTs could be stored on the decentralized cloud and games could be integrated to access them from this storage point and users could trade them through the NFTHub marketplace.

Gamefi can be truly free to play and play to earn if it were powered by the TRON blockchain. It is a win/win situation, players have easier access to the game and Gamefi developers could mint cost efficiently as long as they held a large enough stake of TRX.","self","https://redd.it/tudmp4"

The second type is what r/BoredApeYachtClub is doing. Their images of Apes are funny, some of those agley, some are strange. But this is not the images people buy, but the **club membership** getting special privileges and rights for that particular community.

And there is a third type of NFTs which I recently found. And this last type is neither made for art nor for membership. The main purpose of those is not an aesthetic outlook. I'm talking about **non-art scientific NFTs**, for example the ones that u/VScotch and his team do for r/PatronizeAStar NFT campaign. In this case people do not buy an image because it looks good or it gives an entrance ticket to a club. Particularly *Patronize a Star* campaign uses it for charity. But the images themselves are produced based on exact star coordinates from astronomers scientific databases so it is based on real data and has a scientific value. That is an interesting concept.

JustMoney, the community-driven deflationary token on TRON Network and exchange platform, recently launched its newest product called JustMoney Bridge, which allows users to move assets between TRON, BTTC, BTC, and Polygon.

The newest product makes JustMoney from multi-chain to fully cross-chain and it ensures a fast, easy and cheaper way to move assets from one blockchain to another. Asides from moving TRON and JM tokens, JustMoney also offers this service to other projects that would apply for their tokens to be added to the bridge.

I wanted to make a review for a pretty awesome service called TokenGoodies: www.tokengoodies.com

The website is an energy exchange for the Tron network. It hosts buy and sell orders for energy, which is a totally ingenious idea. 

I had heard of this website before, but I had never tried it out until today. I was able to lend out (for a period of 3 days) 500k energy and I was paid 32.5 TRX for the transaction. The user interface was totally smooth and seamless. I simply connected my wallet, found a buy order for the amount of energy I was willing to lend, and clicked the sell button. The website utilizes the ‚ÄúStake for Other Users‚Äù feature on Tron, so my TRX never leaves my wallet. The 32.5 TRX was paid out to my wallet immediately. I am also able to vote and receive block rewards from my SR as normal. 

For those of you who may have excess energy sitting around, I would highly recommend checking out tokengoodies and earning some profit from it.

Additionally, if you need energy lent to you, give the website a look as well. The lending prices are much cheaper than burning TRX.

This is a great service with so many future applications. And it is a service that is only possible on the Tron blockchain. 

I think that we should do our best to support the good projects in the Tron community, so I hope this post gives them some exposure and inspires other Tron users to try out their platform.

TLDR: Check out www.tokengoodies.com and earn profit from your excess energy or buy energy for cheaper than burning your TRX.","self","https://redd.it/ufheo0"

1. ApeNFT Marketplace - Finally a marketplace that every NFT collection can use. No need for collections to build their own marketplace and have this fragmented BS we had. Now they can focus on something else....like gaming.

https://apenft.io/assets


2. TronVerse - They are being called Tron's leader in the gaming sector for their fast paced FPS action. They launched their P2E Tron Bull Lite version a few weeks ago and it has gotten a lot of positive feedback, even from Justin. The gameplay is extremely fun and addictive and you earn ApeNFT while doing it. They will soon launch the token to an open world combat gaming platform built on the Unreal engine. 

Current Promo:  Mint 5 get 2 free whitelists. Ends Sunday.

3.Cukies World - With a big following, good influencer support(such as Reven), and cross chain functionality(BSC), Cukies World is one to keep an eye on.

4. TronNinjas - Still in early minting phase but their team is working hard to bring gaming utility to their NFTs. They just got verified by ApeNFT as an original collection on Tron.

[https://tdr.org/#/](https://tdr.org/#/)   and [https://usdd.io/#/](https://usdd.io/#/)

I can imagine they will be staying on top of things and watching it very closely.   

"" The Super Representatives (SRs) on TRON play a pivotal role in guaranteeing the security and stability of the USDD protocol. Specifically, they safeguard the TRON network by participating in the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism and provide stability for USDD by absorbing short-term price volatility. To incentivize SRs for the long run, the USDD protocol rewards them with fee incomes incurred from stablecoin swaps and TRX-stablecoin swaps.

 ‚óè Tobin Tax: This is the fixed fee rate for stablecoin swaps in an ecosystem. The fee rate depends on the stablecoin involved in the swap. Since USDD is currently the only stablecoin in the USDD protocol, Tobin Tax is not applicable at this stage and will come into play after more stablecoins are introduced. 

‚óè Spreading fee: Each swap between USDD and TRX will incur a spreading fee (0.5% at the minimum). The USDD protocol will maintain stability under extreme market volatility by automatically adjusting the fee rate. ""

Super Representatives are involved in the process.

About USDD:  The market cap will be managed very closely, while building the liquidity pool.    Their goal is 10-20% of the marketcap of TRX and no higher.  They are not interested in using leverage to build the marketcap.  Current APY's are promotional and will be adjusted at some point.    The rates will still be competitive but not as high.

How are you all?

&#x200B;

Today, I will show you an app where you can earn a healthy amount of money with a little investment.

&#x200B;

For this earning, you just need TRON. You have to buy TRON from any crypto platform and send it to OKTRX app. Let's guess, you deposit 1000 TRX to OKTRX, and you will get 28 TRX daily. You can withdraw your profit every day.

&#x200B;

OKTRX Profit rules:

&#x200B;

For 1000 TRX you will get 28 trx

For 10000 TRX you will get 320 trx

For 100000 TRX you will get 4000TRX

&#x200B;

The best part is that you can withdraw every day and get your investment in one month; then, you can reinvest your earnings for more profits.

&#x200B;

{Always collect your profit daily by going to the trading option and also withdraw daily}

My proposal is to charge fees to sellers below USD 0.9850  (1 - price = fee)  to make an attack expensive and use the fees to burn TRX making TRX more valuable. Doubling down to make it very costly for any attacker.

Examples

USDD at USD 0.9900 - charge the seller 0.10 % nominal fee and use those fees to burn TRX

USDD at USD 0.9850 - charge the seller 0.10 % nominal fee and use those fees to burn TRX

USDD at USD 0.9825 - charge the seller 1.75 % fee and use those fees to burn TRX

USDD at USD 0.9800 - charge the seller 2 % fee and use those fees to burn TRX

USDD at USD 0.9600 - charge the seller 4 % fee and use those fees to burn TRX

USDD at USD 0.9500 - charge the seller 5 % fee and use those fees to burn TRX

USDD at USD 0.9000 - charge the seller 10 % fee and use those fees to burn TRX

...

Buyer of USDD pays no fees as he supports the stablecoin by buying it.

**Someone please forward this to Justin Sun**

Enigmatic ¬†developer Moonoshi, whose person is shrouded in mystery and whose activity is followed by ¬† gossips and speculations,has created a project that now rightly claims the title of original DeFi.

No one could ever make any ¬†modifications or amendments to the contract. The contract gets 100 out of 100 safety grade after the audit. Born as an ordinary meme coin ¬†in everyman's eyes, the coin received its technical component just two months after launch. In collaboration ¬†with ¬†$ CIV team, Sanin Inu is ready to ¬†present its own farming/staking platform just in the middle of June, while as we all know ¬†lots of such type coins get their utility only in a year's time frame. Combined with the fact that $SANI doesn\`t have its own funds even for marketing means we can call it a Community based coin ¬†without any doubts. In addition to the farming/Stacking platform, Sanin Inu will receive its own DAO, where the community will be able to officially make a decision on the further development of the project. Originally announced as Shiba Inu killer, Sanin inu has ¬†close links with this token.It is a proven fact that many early holders of $SHIB have already invested their funds into this new iconic project. The only question that arises is- what will $SANI ¬†be capable of (as an experiment in the field of real DeFi) , if ¬†just in a few weeks ¬†time after the launch they have already created so much fuss around themselves?

Well that surely isn‚Äôt the future of the NFT space. NFTs need utility in some fashion, whether it is gaming with TronVerse or Cukies, or even physical actions that lead to rewards like walking for NFTs with StepN. It‚Äôs time for those NFTs that have zero utility, to be used in some manner.

NFT assets are moving at such a fast pace that NFTs that don‚Äôt evolve are losing it‚Äôs traction, utility is the king of the future. TronVerse is leading the way to open up their open-world shooter, Metaverse experience to other projects on Tron.  Allowing other NFT collections to integrate into their Metaverse if they meet certain requirements clearing up that digital dust in your wallet from NFTs that have zero utility. Have you ever played animal crossing? Cukies is basically the play-to-earn version of it where each NFT has different traits that allow you to harvest more resources. We also mentioned StepN which is a lifestyle app which enables those who enjoy walking or encourages those who don‚Äôt to be rewarded with NFTs for completing goals and requirements with sneaker NFTs. NFTs will be categorized by their utilities they offer going forward.

There are many existing ways that NFTs have utility today, some examples are gaming, event access, staking, rewards based on requirements completed, and much more that is still being discovered and experimented. 

Tron has a great opportunity at capturing the likes of many different niche communities based on the utilities of the NFT collections. What are some utilities that you think are the most prominent at the moment for NFTs?","self","https://redd.it/uzef4q"

I'm not a blockchain expert but as far as I can tell, it looks like there was a smart contract that was signed 40 days ago that gave ""Increased Approval"" to the following address:  TGasPac3bnQRZSS93wLFpmBSmzQATfChym.

Then the scammer address authorized the transfer of the 11.5K from the user's address to this address: TEYjvdueQW8akrAvgmQ6pG5ZKxGpQ5ge8V and the 11.5K USDT are currently still there.

Not only that, but it looks like quite a few other addresses have granted ""Increased Approval"" to this scammer address. To me it looks like the scammer is getting people to sign a smart contract that authorizes them as a spender on their account.

**Here is the user's address who was scammed:**

TYDTfPr4WoFYxWW3K7gwJTaksxatWKXRQh

**Here is the scammer's address that received approval to spend:**

TGasPac3bnQRZSS93wLFpmBSmzQATfChym

**Here is the address that the scammer sent the funds to:**

TEYjvdueQW8akrAvgmQ6pG5ZKxGpQ5ge8V

**Here is the Transaction hash where the funds were stolen:**  eb576eb3a48f4c8fd879113d77c60a2100d37d48407dfbccd2248fc34fb97a50

**Here is the hash for the smart contract from 40 days ago, which gave approval for the scammer to gain access to the user's account:**

0ca32e88cc631b85761ff315760ac1e57a0e789fde8f1488fd5795ff197a2921

If  anyone can help shed some light on this situation, or if they know of a way to contact Tron support, it would be greatly appreciated. I don't know if there is any way that we could help to restore the user's funds, but it's worth a shot.

It's also very concerning that many other users have also given approval to the scammer address. This means that the scammer address can withdraw funds from these other accounts as well. If you're reading this, it might be worth it to look over your address's Approvals on Tronscan and make sure everything is legitimate. Please be careful out there people.

&#x200B;

**Another Note:**

The same user also had \~$927 worth of funds stolen on Metamask AGAIN today. How is this possible that the scammer was able to gain access to two different accounts on two different blockchains? Is it two separate scams or the same scammer? My first thought was a virus, but the user says that they are using an iphone which is extremely rare to get a virus on.

Here is the transaction on etherscan: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1008ae6bd818798659c2d15fdb8db6b23355d99abd13c823cb3bd3d229183621](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1008ae6bd818798659c2d15fdb8db6b23355d99abd13c823cb3bd3d229183621)

Hopefully someone can make sense of this.

 To this end, it purchased the equivalent of USD 50 million in BTC and Tron (TRX) in order to support the issuance of the recently launched cryptocurrency, which maintains parity with the US dollar.

The purchase was reported by the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) Tron Reserve in a tweet. In this way, the reserves would exceed USD 700 million, although the organization's site still lists the figure of USD 669 million.

All this in order to continue to increase the creation of decentralized protocols in its ecosystem, such as DeFi protocols in pre-release in the style of the next LunaFi or growing economy projects inspired by Minosis Token. (According to its community).

It so happens that the amount still includes the 14,040 BTC reported by CryptoNews a week ago. Adding the USD 50 million in bitcoin acquired yesterday, the amount would rise to 15,836 BTC.

The amount of reserves in the stablecoin Tether (USDT) did change since the last publication in this media, as it went from USD 240 million to USD 140 million.

Although Tron's main goal is to maintain USDD collateralization at a rate of over 130% in order to ensure that the stablecoin always possesses the necessary backing, as described in the project's white paper. This strategy is called ""overcollateralization"".

To achieve this, they appeal to an algorithmic method and to create a reserve to be used in cases of emergency. This reserve is composed of bitcoin and other cryptoassets that allow USDD to maintain parity even in the face of unforeseen unfavorable circumstances.

In addition to the parity-preserving algorithm, which emulates the price of various assets so that the stablecoin maintains the expected equivalence, there is also the burning of TRX, the network's other cryptocurrency. To issue USDD, an equivalent amount in TRX has to be taken out of circulation.

At the close of this article, the collateralization of the stablecoin reaches 192%, taking into account the two factors mentioned above. The current supply of USDD is 723,321,764 units. The first phase of the project roadmap, which will run until October 2022, envisages a maximum issuance of USDD 2 billion.","self","https://redd.it/vbjbp7"

When LUNA melted, I sold even more.

I sold my last bit @ .076.

I was always bullish on trx until the USDD announcement.

To ANYONE with more money than they can afford to lose in TRX - please consider selling at least a portion of your position.  This situation can go from bad to worse in a matter of hours.

Justin Sun and co. have thrown 700 million dollars at this, and [here is the chart](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDDUSDT/). Switch to the 5 day for an accurate picture.  This is the data. This is factual. This is a real problem.  The chart looks like this post 700 MILLION dollars. The fact that big money is front-running USDD is also concerning. 

* EDIT I never said TRX and USDD is exactly like LUNA and UST.   They are not.

There is, however, an indirect association with TRX - as USDD is in the Tron ecosystem.  

If USDD goes down, TRX price action will suffer. Trust will be shattered. Tokens sold. Potential Liquidation cascades.

Things are bearish for alt coins. Things are bearish for equities.  Inflation is high. This USDD de-peg could be the final nail in the coffin for the project I once had faith in - TRX.  This is just a warning for your serious consideration.

He owns Kucoin and needs a backup stablecoin to allow exchanges to functions if these other ones continue going to shit.

Justin Sun realized this and has been essentially making an overcollateralized stablecoin more similar to DAI than to UST. USDD is currently so overcollateralized (250%) that other than luna fud and fear im not sure why it is having so much trouble holding the peg. pretty sure people are just making cash in both directions cycling through the funding fees and the depeg.

The only real mistake Sun cab make is burning billions in collateral to unnecessarily defend the peg. All he has to say is at one point, if it goes too low, USDD will simply be redeemable 1:1 for USD. The peg will be restored in a couple trades.

# USDD Is Over Collateralized

USDD currently has collateralization of over 316%.  You can monitor the current reserve by looking [https://tdr.org/#/](https://tdr.org/#/)  


If we just take into account the reserve assets that are non-volatile such as USDC and USDT, there are $1,140,000,000  stable assets to back up only $723 million issued USDD.   


If USDD were to dip to say $0.9, Justin Sun would only need to use $36 million in the reserves to repeg.  
Calculations can be found [here](https://twitter.com/0xSh1r0/status/1536716625474629634?s=20&t=CzvSZeeJ-UpFhYG9uXM5hg)

Liquidity on CEXes is nonexistent As per Coingecko, you just need   

\- $54k in Poloniex 

 \- $125k in Huobi 

\- $59k in KuCoin   

to send USDD to 0.99 (possibly this would be just a wick, you might need some more to backstop it from going down again) 

&#x200B;

[USDD on CEX](https://preview.redd.it/trf9hq0l5x591.jpg?width=2582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d6b144b620e9bc164a2784efdf4353481a4ffd8)

# USDD Is Centralized During Space 1.0

In order to protect the growth of USDD, the mechanism for minting/burning USDD is closely managed by TronDao Reserve and whitelisted institutions during its initial phase. It is not open to the public like in the case of Luna/UST.

&#x200B;

[Excerpt from TDR WhitePaper](https://preview.redd.it/ko42fty67x591.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ebb2744ca40c1c2a426f73fac8daa0e99ec92dc)

The full whitepaper can be read at [https://usdd.io/#/](https://usdd.io/#/)

Later on by the end of the year, the mechanism will be made public and it will be automated.

# So Why Hasn't USDD Repegged?

There are a couple of theories floating around out there.

1. TDR to repeg USDD manually takes time. If market conditions are going to be highly volatile this can be a pain in the ass.
2. Let the consumers restore the peg naturally. This is giving people the opportunity to buy USDD at a discount so that when it repegs they make a decent 1-3% gain. Of course, if consumers don't then TDR will have to spend a little reserve and then slowly release when demand picks up so that they themselves can profit that 1-3%.
3. Letting the USDD peg go a bit baits retail and those who don't understand, into a UST 2.0 narrative, convincing unseasoned traders to short TRX. Big players/institutions (Those behind TDR) can then short squeeze and liquidate shorters to make some $$ and make vested interest in TRX stronger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

4. The TronDao Reserve doesn't consider USDD depegged unless it hits below 5%. This is why reserve wasn't used on the USDD peg but instead used to buy cheap TRX being shorted for the short squeeze.

# But isn't 30% APY Unsustainable? 

Yes... yes, it is. In the case of Anchor/UST, which is everyone's favorite comparison they tried guaranteeing this fixed APY rate on the protocol.    


In the case of USDD, the 30% rate is an introductory offer that benefits early adopters of USDD. It also helps grow the demand for USDD but it is not fixed at all. In fact, Justin says that it will be adjusted as USDD grows in demand.

# Why Back USDD with Another Stablecoin?

In the same interview, Justin explains that they want 2 safety nets, especially during the volatility of the current market. They want 1 the safety net of the algorithm, and if that fails then 2, the safety net of easily deployable backing like USDC or USDT.  Combining both!

&#x200B;

Things aren't looking good!  


but.... what should we be doing as Tronics and investors to benefit?  


If you believe in Cryptocurrency and in Bitcoin, then a return to 60k Bitcoin is inevitable. So the first step is having conviction in Crypto.

# 1. Ask Yourself: Do I See a Return of a $60k Bitcoin eventually? (Conviction praise the lord)

  
If the answer is yes, then we have to understand something else.

Buying during a bull run has more risk than buying during a bear market.  In a bull run, you have the risk of buying at the top and waiting forever for it to return.  In a Bear market, things are already down 80-90% and the only risk is that you don't buy the complete bottom. 

Sure, assets might go further down another 50%. You might lose some money while purchasing now but if you slowly Dollar-cost average in, then the next bull run will make you a lot of money. This is as long as you have conviction in question number 1. 

This bear market could last 1 year, 2 years, or maybe 3 years, so it takes a lot of willpower. 

# 2. Look for the correct Low-Risk Assets (Target Locked)

I know this is a TRON Reddit but there are a lot of Crypto Assets out there. You should be doing your own research into which projects/crypto you want to support and what ""the narrative"" wants to support.  

The narrative is very strong and Justin Sun, one of the best traders IMO,  is a great example of investing outside of the Tron Ecosystem to benefit off of it and then bringing back and securing that money. 

Ideally, you want to be looking at projects that are within the top 100 MC. The lower the MC the higher the risk of assets going completely bankrupt. 

I actually have some $$ invested in a very small community project JustMoney which is built on TRON. This is highly risky but since they haven't received a bunch of outside capital debt and they continue to build, and I have done my due diligence on the team, I feel safe within such a very small project.  Very small projects make you the whale but I wouldn't recommend investing in small projects during the bear. This is more for people who want to support the development and shouldn't be based on making $$.   


Only invest in super low caps to support development. It's basically like charity so consider that money gone. 

# 3. Buy Buy Buy (New Single by Timberlake)

Once you have figured out which assets you are going to buy, then do so. Don't buy all at once. Slowly feed your money into it and consider your investment can still go down. Don't invest more than you should. If you need the money in the short term don't invest at all. 

Now....

**Why TRX?**

1. Justin Sun is going nowhere, he is a billionaire playboy diplomat (not making this up) with enough money from Ethereum/Bitcoin/and other investments to fund the goddamn construction of a new world order. This man is Batman. CryptoTwitter might say lex Luthor. 
2. The blockchain is really good. It works, it functions well. 
3. The blockchain holds a vast majority of crypto stables, if tether and circle somehow die then crypto dies and Tron dies with it. I don't see this happening. 
4. Tron has already survived a previous crypto winter. That's right, it has experience. 
5. TronDao hasn't been hit hard at all due to the fact of the narrative. All these Crypto investment firms going bankrupt are all ones that had little to no interest in TRON due to the CryptoTwitter narrative.  This is actually a benefit.  Bazinga!
6. TRX Supply is fully distributed during the bull run and deflationary on its own. It is hyper deflationary with USDD. For example, AVAX still needs to unlock 30% of its supply into circulation. 
7. TronDao continues to try to attract development via The Tron hackathon and also the continued ApeNFT Developer Fund. This presents teams with the opportunity to build on Tron or BTTC, and win some $$. NFT projects can also receive funding from ApeNFT.

High risks with high returns lure youngsters to invest in cryptocurrencies. But every time you invest in any asset, you must be completely educated about its pros and cons.

The Crypto market is diversified enough with thousands of options to choose from where to invest, profitably. The biggest reason to go for altcoins is that despite being high-risk investments, because of their small market capitalization, they are cheap to invest in. Bitcoin is overvalued. Its maximum is an increase to $100,000 by the end of the year. Your $100 will only turn into $500 which is not bad ofc, but it is much more profitable - to buy alt. The risks are slightly higher, but the growth potential is ten times greater, making a good risk-reward ratio.

* **Tron (TRX)**

TRX is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Originally TRX tokens were ERC-20-based tokens deployed on Ethereum, but a year later they were moved to their network. Tron is here with a solution to a more reliable network structure, user asset, intrinsic value, and a higher degree of decentralization consensus.

* **Harmony (ONE)**

Harmony is a blockchain platform designed to facilitate the creation and use of decentralized applications (DApps). The network aims to innovate the way decentralized applications work by focusing on random state sharding, which allows the creation of blocks in seconds. Their mainnet runs Ethereum applications with 2-second transaction finality and 100 times lower fees. Despite the recent hack, its team will fix the wounds and make it right.

* **Midas (MIDAS)**

It is a crypto-investment platform launched in 2018 that provides passive income streams to crypto investors. Powered by the MIDAS token which is supported and traded on the Fantom blockchain, the platform develops CeDeFi model and expands opportunities to leverage and maximize passive yields. Its token price performance differs from BTC as the [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) provides regular buybacks, yield-farming opportunities on DEXs, apy boost and increased rewards for affiliate partners.

* **Stellar(XLM)**

It is a peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized network created in 2014 by The Stellar Development Foundation. The network officially launched in 2015 to connect the world‚Äôs financial systems and ensure a protocol for payment providers and financial institutions. The platform is designed to move financial resources swiftly and reliably at a minimal cost. Stellar links people, banks, and payment processors and allows users to create, send and trade multiple types of crypto.

* **Ripple (XRP)**

The digital asset XRP was built to be the most practical cryptocurrency for applications across the financial services space. Using proven crypto and blockchain technology honed over a decade, Ripple‚Äôs enterprise-grade solutions are faster, more transparent, and more cost-effective than traditional financial services. XRP powers innovative technology transforming the global financial services space

* **Curve (CRV)**

The Curve is a decentralized exchange for stablecoins that uses an automated market maker (AMM) to manage liquidity. Launched in January 2020, Curve is synonymous with the decentralized finance (DeFi) phenomenon and has seen significant growth in the second half of 2020. Curve recently launched a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with CRV as its in-house token. The DAO uses Ethereum-based creation tool, Aragon, to connect multiple smart contracts used for users‚Äô deposited liquidity.

* **Zilliqa (ZIL)**

Zilliqa is a public, permissionless blockchain that is designed to offer high throughput with the ability to complete thousands of transactions per second. It seeks to solve the issue of blockchain scalability and speed by employing sharding as a second-layer scaling solution. The native utility token of Zilliqa, ZIL, is used to process transactions on the network and execute smart contracts.","self","https://redd.it/vp1v4t"

Justin Sun, the founder of Tron and Grenada Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO), said that blockchain could fix global economic crises at the Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12). According to CoinQuora earlier, Sun spoke during the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) segment, where delegates of various WTO member states raised the discussion on climate change, ocean management, and e-commerce, among other topics.

He revealed that Grenada is ‚Äúheavily dependent‚Äù on a multilateral trading system that is predictable, transparent, and efficient. Sun added that he is ‚Äúworking closely with WTO‚Äôs program on e-commerce in support of digitizing the economy.‚Äù With the emergence of blockchain technology and presence of a high performing distributed execution environment for everyone in blockchains like Stellar, Concordium, etc, it is very possible.

Notably, the MC12 conference discussed pressing issues, including the post-pandemic crisis, food safety and security, environment protection, IP protection on COVID-19 vaccines, and e-commerce, among other subjects. 

The event saw the decision to impose the Work Program on Small Economies, the TRIPS non-violation and situation complaints, and the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Declaration for the MC12 initiative.

 In 2017, Justin Sun founded Tron, a decentralized, open-source blockchain. The businessman stepped down from his post as Tron‚Äôs CEO to become a diplomat for Grenada in December 2021.","self","https://redd.it/vs69mp"

4 years ago Justin bought the Poloniex exchange and revived it. I actually quite like it. Today it would make sense for Justin to buy Celsius:

* Celsius Swap function could route / execute trades on Poloniex adding volume / liquidity
* Celsius could provide liquidity to Poloniex in exchange for interest payments
* CEL token could move to the Tron blockchain drastically cutting blockchain fees
* Celsius staking could merge with Poloniex staking - saving hardware / staff cost
* Celsius mining could team-up with Poloniex offering Poloniex clients cloud mining
* Celsius could integrate safe file storage and sharing utilizing Sun's Bittorrent","self","https://redd.it/vvoyn6"

Explain how USDD isn't an exact replica of the Luna situation. Exactly how does USDD algo avoid the death spiral?

Why will this algo stablecoin work and all others have failed? Because if you say that it's collateralized, it's really just set by Justin sun, so it's immensely centralized, and the colateraliztion is temporary by nature. As soon as it gets big enough it won't be colateralized anymore and will be dependent on the actual algo working.","self","https://redd.it/w0w4gv"

A crypto noob here, needing help in understanding how are these two tokens interchangeable? From what I've read, say that I had 100 USDT on Ether, and I can send them to Tron. 2 questions:

1. how does this technically happen on chain? what are the high level steps involved in cross chain communication?
2. what happens with USDT supply on both chains when USDT is sent from one chain to another?

The USTX team never stopped developing and now our ecosystem has grown with another dApp that many users are liking: WARP!

[USTX WARP](https://preview.redd.it/2lhcc93qdvf91.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=f044365a6201654192a108f401ec5bd0d59b9e56)

# What is WARP?

It‚Äôs a DeFi app, within the USTX ecosystem, that implements a pseudo delta neutral farming strategy. Mmmm‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt sound simple at all. Let me try again: **it‚Äôs an app that allows the users to stake USDD and get 30%+ APR** with low risk and easy access.

You can read all the details about how it works on our [Medium](https://medium.com/@ustx/ustx-warp-how-to-bend-space-and-time-to-simplify-defi-de7147ba21fb) page or on [TronDAO](https://forum.trondao.org/t/warp-by-ustx-team-an-easy-to-use-defi-app-to-maximize-usdd-yield/3747) forum page.

I'm just stating a few facts:

* TVL is close to 30,000 USDD right now, steadily increasing
* APR for ""normal"" users is over **24%**
* APR for USTX holders is over **36%**
* **Deposits are locked for 1 week only, so it's very flexible**
* **Rewards are paid weekly and can be compounded**
* **Stake USDD and get rewards in USDD**
* To use WARP you just need USDD and Tronlink (also Klever and Math wallets are supported)
* **WARP contributes to USTX buyback**, checkout the chart below

What is TronNinjas:

TronNinjas is a NFT GameFi project on the Tron blockchain where you can play arcade games and earn our in-game token TronNinjas Token (TNT). The TNT token can be earned just by playing single-player games and in our bi-weekly tournaments with other NFT holders. We also have the TronNinjas store, where you can spend your TNT for upgrades. TNT is also tradable at JustMoney.

A percentage of the store revenue will be sent to our staking contract, where users can stake their TronNinja NFT. You can stake your NFT and TNT and earn TNT from our staking contract.

Tronbies are post-apocalyptic space creatures from the planet Tronbie. Their traits and attributes are inspired by pop culture. We are driven to help grow and add to the NFT space on the Tron Network! We believe that Tron users have yet to experience the full potential that the Tron ecosystem has to offer.

We have recently created a minting site and deployed our own minting contract for our collection. The uniqueness of this NFT contract is that it contains an oracle within it that makes it impossible to cheat the minting process.

We also have our token, $TBT, that is able to be used as an option to mint our NFTs. As we move further along our roadmap we will create more use-cases for our token in the GameFi space, MetaVerse projects and even an NFT marketplace.

FUNCTIONS OF OUR NFT CONTRACT

\-Minting with $TBT and $TRX  
\-Future NFT Staking  
\-Buy and Sell through our upcoming Marketplace

Circle the creators of USDC have the ability in their coding to freeze USDC assets (USDT also has this feature). Ordered by the US government they froze assets within some Ethereum wallets related to Tornado cash. 

Now while I agree with Tornado Cash being sanctioned as it goes against blockchain being an open ledger, I do not agree with centralized stablecoins being able to freeze assets at orders from the US government. 

The case for a fully decentralized stablecoin like USDD has never been better. 

The issue I have is that USDD is also collateralized by a significant portion of USDT and USDC. So say if the US government thought USDD was a threat to the U.S Dollar and that it is Chinese or sanctions algorithmic stablecoins in general, they could easily ask Circle or Tether to freeze the USDC assets related to the collateralized backing of USDD. 

Now I understand that during USDD's growing years it does need to be backed by something more stable in order to protect itself from volatility and malicious entities trying to depeg it but I don't think USDD can rely on these stablecoins as it gets bigger if it truly wants to be decentralized.

What are your thoughts? 

***\*\* As a side note\*\****  I am kind of sad that USDJ kind of doesn't get the limelight on TRON very often or spotlighted. I kind of wished they would have improved upon USDJ instead of creating USDD.","self","https://redd.it/wjthts"

I see this as a huge accomplishment for TRON because Wintermute is one of the leading crypto market makers on both centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges, trading billions of dollars per month.

There is over $10,000 in crypto for this 30-day challenge, and users will get the chance to win a piece of it every day.  So get out there help and win some CRYPTO!  


Laurent Perello is a recent TRONDAO advisor and a big driving force for inclusivity within Crypto and Blockchain development and bringing Crypto mass adoption to literally EVERYONE in the world.

### What Is TRON?

[**TRON** ](https://tron.network/)is a high-performance decentralized blockchain-based operating system that allows developers to build highly efficient smart contracts. Initially, it was positioned as a social network, but only of a new generation ‚Äî independent of any centralized management. However, TRON has gone far beyond its original vision. And to date, TRON is a popular smart contract-capable platform within which developers launch their decentralized applications and issue custom tokens. TRON solves the scalability problem inherent in Ethereum by increasing throughput and shifting gas fees. But, it is quite difficult to compare TRON with Ethereum because their architecture differs directly. TRON has a hierarchical system of accounts and many management functions available to network participants.¬†

For the developer of smart contracts, if we leave aside the blockchain, TRON offers, in fact, a database with an accounting system, access, and logic that the contract developer controls. TRON allows you to focus exclusively on the business logic of applications, giving the developer almost all the necessary tools to work with accounts and their data. That is why TRON can be called practically an operating system on the blockchain.

### TRON Benefits

* **Scalability.** The number of transactions processed per second is a significant problem for most blockchain platforms. The limitation is that operations require each node to have a consensus for everything that goes through them. Low speed negatively affects users. TRON can provide about 10,000 TPS due to the DPOS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) mechanism.
* **TRON Virtual Machine (TVM).** TVM is a smart contract execution environment supporting the universal JavaScript language. Initially, TVM was a fork from EVM, so it is almost 100% compatible with it. Thanks to EVM compatibility, Solidity developers can easily transfer decentralized applications and benefit from the scalability and cost-effectiveness of TRON. The crucial difference between TVM and EVM is that it uses the concept of Energy. That is, when performing transactions on TVM, TRX is not consumed. In addition, the developers promise that in the future, TVM will be compatible with all mainstream VMs.
* **The platform has the properties of an operating system.** The creators declared Ethereum the main competitor. Ethereum works as a decentralized supercomputer. TRON is an operating system, a complex of interconnected programs convenient for developers and users.

### How Does TRON Work?

TRON operates based on the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) protocol. This is a consensus algorithm in which coin holders choose a group of network validators by voting. As a result, a large list of candidates is created. Participants have their own rating (the number of votes received). The final block producer group is created, consisting of 27 Super Representatives.¬†

Voting is one of the types of transactions. The user signs the transaction with a private key indicating the candidate and sends it to the network as a regular transaction. To participate in the procedure, it is necessary to maintain a fixed number of tokens on the account constantly. If you withdraw coins, the results will be canceled.

Every 6 hours, Super Representatives are re-elected. Super Representatives receive rewards for verifying and packing all transaction data broadcasted on the network. A new block is released every 3 seconds and contains 16 TRX (Block Rewards). Nodes selected by users share part of the reward with those who voted for them.

### TRON Transaction Fees

The difference between TRON from other cryptocurrencies is that transactions are free. There are no fees charged for the transactions performed. Instead, some of the system resources are reserved for processing outgoing transactions.

TRON differs from other platforms by its architecture. From a technical point of view, it is a server with multiple hardware (processors, RAM, bandwidth). Users can reserve resources for their needs. 5000 bandwidth points are allocated to the user every day. The regular transaction consumes part of the bandwidth points. In case of exhaustion of daily points, users can freeze their TRX to get more bandwidth points. If the user has not frozen TRX and his bandwidth points have been exhausted, the protocol charges TRX from the sender‚Äôs account. Smart contract transactions consume Energy. Users need to freeze TRX to get a daily energy limit to make a smart contract transaction. This solution allows the network to increase capacity without changing the cost of transactions.

### TRON Tokens

The native [**TRX**](https://simplehold.io/coins/tron) coin is issued on the TRON blockchain and is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain and its virtual machine. TRX does not have a maximum limited supply; at the time of writing, about 93 billion TRX are in circulation. TRX is used to issue rewards, receive bandwidth points and Energy, participate in voting, as a medium currency for all TRC-based tokens, and as a unit of calculation in the products of the TRON ecosystem (NFT marketplaces, DeFi lending markets, and so on).

To counteract inflation, in addition to staking, a burning mechanism is used. As already mentioned, transactions in the TRON network consume bandwidth points and Energy. If users do not have enough bandwidth points or Energy to cover the resources needed to complete the transaction, they are required to burn TRX. Thus, TRX is permanently removed from circulation.

In addition, TRON provides several TRC token standards to enhance the capabilities of all types of transactions inside and outside the network. The main TRC token standards are:¬†

* TRC-10. The most developed token standard initiates transactions in the blockchain. It allows you to perform operations at a low price without using the TRON Virtual Machine (TVM). To issue TRC-10 tokens, the user must pay 1024 TRX.
* TRC-20. An improved version of the TRC-10 standard. The standard allows for cryptocurrency transactions on the TRON blockchain (for example, USDT TRC-20, USDC TRC-20, BTT, etc.). Its function is similar to TRC-10. The only difference is that it is connected to the TRON Virtual Machine (TVM). This token standard is compatible with ERC-20.
* TRC-721. This is the standard for issuing non-fungible tokens (NFTs). TRC-721 is fully compatible with ERC-721.

### Closing Thoughts

Many DeFi projects today are moving away from Ethereum towards less loaded blockchains, and TRON is one of them. It has several advantages:

* Freedom of data. Users have power over their smart contracts, applications, and content. Safe and censorship-resistant.
* High throughput. Up to 10,000 transactions per second.
* No fees. Zero fees for everyday needs and freezing TRX for resource-intensive tasks with the possibility of a refund.
* Popularity. TRX is listed on many cryptocurrency exchanges and is used by developers.
* ICOs. Users can conduct fundraising on the platform.
* Support for the universal JavaScript language. Compatibility with Solidity.

Developers are working hard to make the network easy to use. For example, TRX has successfully integrated some services, allowing users to tip content creators with TRX (Peiwo), pay for travel (Alternative Airlines, Travala), pay for purchases (Spend credit card, Coinsbee), and even pay for adult services (Pornhub). In addition, many popular DeFi protocols have been launched on the TRON, for example, decentralized stablecoin lending platform ‚Äî JustStable, SunSwap DEX, oracle project WinkLink, and others.

Moreover, such popular stablecoins as USDT and USDC function on the TRON blockchain, allowing users to make fast and cost-effective transactions.

Edit: You need to use version 1 of SunSwap in order to get a normal price when swapping for BTC or ETH. Liquidity is sufficiently high when using SunSwap version 1. I was looking at swaps using version 2 of SunSwap and that's why the liquidity was so low.

I previously used KuCoin to transfer BTC and ETH into the TRON account, but the TRX network (for withdrawals) for BTC and ETH have been disabled.

Also, the liquidity for BTC and ETH via SunSwap is now very low (the price impact is very high when trying to swap small amounts for BTC and ETH).

What is going on?

Why is liquidity of BTC and ETH on the TRX blockchain so low right now?

This seems to be a new thing, because I was previously able to swap or transfer (from KuCoin) for BTC/ETH without any issues just a few weeks ago.","self","https://redd.it/x6esr3"

**Performance**

[Last 3 months USTX vs. BTC vs. TRX](https://preview.redd.it/u7171op7dtm91.png?width=1826&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd7e1e2988d2abb7a52a87798b226783963fc422)

The chart shows a solid performance over the last period, with a steady growth. Remember that USTX main characteristic is to be a low volatility token and from the chart that is quite obvious.

**Staking options**

On top of the performance shown above, users can benefit a high yield and sustainable staking with APR from 2% up to 12%, depending on the lock period chosen.

**Development and awards**

https://preview.redd.it/hz1vbg3mftm91.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5dc7aff75cc7b907231e1265e253846e9e91f0e

Two new products were released: UpFolio and the award winning WARP!  
We particpated in 2nd round of Tron Grand Hackathon and won 1st place in DeFi track with WARP. WARP is a single staking USDD app, that gives the best yield (around 30%) on stablecoin.

The overall look and feel of the platform has been tweaked and modernized.

The last development happened a few days ago, following a stakeholder vote on our portal: now USDD is one of the tokens in the main DEX reserve, replacing USDJ.

**Marketing**

The #sTRONgerTogether challenge launched by Laurent Perello has been a great initiative that brought visibility to our project and to many others. We'll keep cooperating with other projects and influencers to improve our project reach toward new users.

**Tokenomics**

USTX mcap is $512,000

USTX staking TVL is 77% of the circulating supply

WARP TVL is 44,000 USDD

USTX ecosystem TVL is $ 465,000 or 91% of total mcap","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/FLVgKKzJh8IfVTTigAXBYfSxMMPFL-DbcUBfWVHj-jI.jpg","https://redd.it/x9ss54"

Do you see yourself as the next entrepreneur, prominent software developer or just someone looking to break into decentralised industries of the future? An exciting and upcoming Hackathon for the TRON community will allow you to not only win funding for your idea and project, but get noticed by industry big-wigs and also have the opportunity to be introduced to potential high-level partners.

**Your Chance to Get Recognition and Funding**

The TRON Grand Hackathon 2022 Season 3, launched by the TRON DAO and [BitTorrent Chain](https://bttc.bittorrent.com/) (BTTC), is about to start accepting applications soon. The widely popular TRON network has over 110 million user accounts on the blockchain, so this is an opportunity to make a real impact on the world. Apply to join the event at [Trondao.org](https://trondao.org/hackathon/) to find out if you have what it takes to win.

**The Hackathon will have a $1.2 million prize pool for winners in six tracks:**

1. **DeFi** ‚Äì From where it originally started, DeFi continues to be a crucial movement for the crypto space as it enables financial services to operate in an open, accessible, and more transparent digital form. The DeFi track focuses on looking for innovative DeFi solutions that are providing accessible financial services to billions of people.
2. **GameFi** ‚Äì The future of gaming is on the blockchain. Entertainment meets web 3.0. This track focuses on finding and developing the next big game idea.
3. **NFT** ‚Äì **Supported by APENFT**, the NFT track embraces creator economies by giving NFT creators both financial benefits and technical support so that their work can reach its full potential. In addition, it looks to empower developers who create novel NFT applications.
4. **Web3** ‚Äì This track focuses on discovering projects who are helping bring the future of the Web to billions of users.
5. **Ecosystem** ‚Äì The first iteration of this Ecosystem track will be mainly focused on Ethereum-based projects (both PoW and PoS) to incentivise ETH developers to work on cross-chain functionality by utilizing the BitTorrent Chain, as well as others, bridging solutions, allowing major L1 blockchains to be linked, and explore the TRON ecosystem at large.
6. **Academy** ‚Äì The TRON Academy track is focused on doing a real-life event for enrolled university students in a ‚ÄòHacker House‚Äô fashion and allowing them to experience the TRON culture and potentially win prizes for developing on TRON.

**Why You Should Join the TRON Grand Hackathon**

Commencing a few months ago, Season 2 of the TRON Grand Hackathon 2022 was a resounding success. It had over 1800 participants, with winners sharing the aggregate bounty of $1 million spread between four tracks: Web3, NFT, GameFi, and DeFi. The high level of participation means that many talented developers have created new projects that will enrich the whole TRON ecosystem for millions of users.

Similar to season 2, there will be judge-voted winners and community-voted winners. The list of [judges](https://trondao.org/hackathon/judges/) includes esteemed industry experts, institutional professionals, and key opinion leaders in the blockchain community, bringing multi-perspective thought leadership in evaluating the wide range of Hackathon projects. Along with revolutionary leadership, mentorship from the judges and feedback, the Hackathon also supported winners with various resources, including potential funding opportunities, liquidity, and integration with partner exchanges.

* Pay for TRX transactions with Bandwidth points from your TRX stake üîú

All in all, lost 2.2k TRX and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND any other wallet that provides staking, these guys are pretty shady, guess it's a lesson, still have recovery phrase so maybe when/if a shake up happens I can get my crypto unlocked and the fuck outta their app. Till then, guess I am out it, just wanted to warn some people, and to learn from my mistake, 2k will be locked till I can access it so... guess I burned 2k üòÇ.

So even if you don't know about all the drama happening over at twitch right now then I can at least wager a guess that you've heard of it before. One of the many things that is combusting the platform at the minute is the revelation that twitch is going to cut big creators split from 70/30 to 50/50. There are a lot of reasons why a big creator might currently want to leave the platform but that plus twitch's recent gambling ban has I'm sure given some very big content creators itchy feet.

And where could these itchy footed content whales scurry to? Not YouTube, that's apparently worse than twitch. Not Facebook that's a career instakill, how about somewhere that allows gambling, has a very attractive revenue spilt and is hungry for content so will do practically anything to accommodate bigger streamers? Say it with me - DLive!! 

As I'm sure you all know, TRX token is intrinsically linked with DLive as it's the way you tip streamers, so it falls to reason that viewers go up, so does the price. And all it could take is one streamer to try the platform, just for a week, that might be enough to start an exodus. You really don't know with the streaming world, literally anything could happen. 

Anyway, that's my take, and if I was holding TRON right now I would be heading over to https://m.twitch.tv/trainwreckstv and spamming the chat hard about moving to DLive, because something's gotta give. 

DISCLAIMER - I DONT REALLY KNOW SHIT AND I TOOK SOME GUESSES ON HOW SOME STUFF WORKS SO OF I'M WRONG DONT COME AT ME. But if I am right and I make you millionaires you can send your appreciation in Tron to -

The TRON community initiated a discussion on upgrading the current stake mechanism. The main content is to separate the resource delegating operation from the staking operation of the TRON network, like supporting resource re-delegating to others without unstaking TRX, therefore, improves the utilization efficiency of resources. At the same time, it is hoped that the new stake mechanism can support the delayed arrival of the unstaked TRX, so that improve the stability of the TRON stake system.

My open-source payment processor  has now implemented tron support for our developer SDK and merchants solutions. You host it on your own server and can connect it to any RPC or your own node. It can accept arbitrary trc20 token payments, not just the ones from top 200 list (those have pre-defined presets in the admin panel).

Also we have implemented a method `get_tx_size` which can calculate bandwidth (size) of your transaction accurately and it can even accurately predict the fee you'll pay!

Here are the questions I have.

* Exactly how much bandwidth is needed for transactions?
* When you say ""zero"" does that include when I send a transaction to an account that is not a smart contract but where I include a message in the transaction text? And when you say ""more than zero"" does that include if I send TRX to a smart contract to call the fallback function (i.e. no transaction bytes)?
* How do I find for sure exactly how much bandwidth I have?
* What happens if I send a transaction and I don't have the required bandwidth?
* Can bandwidth only be held by externally-owned accounts? Is there any way to transfer bandwidth between accounts? Or how about executing a transaction where bandwidth is used by some account that is not the one sending the transaction?
* When I stake TRX for bandwidth, what is the effective rate and exact timing?

&#x200B;

I developed a cryptographic note protocol for the hackathon that works with ZKSnarks, with the goal to create a way to store and transfer value off-chain as gift cards or do instant secure gasless payments that are super simple to use! 

The project is developed with Circom and Solidity and available on BTTC testnet.

You can check it out and please leave a comment on the forums if you like it!

Thanks

I finally found them and added them to my token list in MEW, then I sent them over to Binance. I also did this same process with ETHOS which is now Voyager (VGX). 

Yesterday I wanted to run a tab on my total account so I went to Binance to check up on everything and I didn‚Äôt see my TRX coins or ETHOS. 

Knowing me, I am the type of person to send a small amount of tokens and then wait for the txn to clear and make sure they get deposited. Then I will send a larger amount the second time, wait for txn to process and make sure they got deposited. ESPECIALLY when dealing with something I‚Äôm not familiar with and have to come to Reddit to ask for help on, such as migrating my old TRX tokens to the new ones. 

Anyways, what I can say is I‚Äôm basically 100% sure I sent the coins to Binance, that‚Äôs what etherscan shows as well. 

What doesn‚Äôt make sense is this, keep in mind the person I am which I described above. Always cautious and paranoid so I make sure transactions arrive, I alwayssss do this. Especially when I‚Äôm transferring 100% of the tokens, which was the case here. 

I had like 7,800 TRX and 100 ETHOS/VGX ‚Ä¶ 

My Binance account has .001000 TRX on the dot, and .500000 ETHOS/VGX on the dot. There‚Äôs no way, you just end up with those flush numbers from swapping or converting tokens or something. It‚Äôs like Binance took away my coins or something and left me with this. We could say the coins never arrived or something, but again, I always make sure deposits clear when I‚Äôm moving 100% of the tokens which would‚Äôve been the case here. There‚Äôs literally a 0% chance I sent all my tokens & just said ‚ÄúF it they will get there don‚Äôt caaaaare.‚Äù 

Another thing to even add more weight to this, since they were old contract coins, I would‚Äôve had to take the time to even swap them out for the right coins, which would‚Äôve been the whole point of sending them from my ledger to the exchange anyways. So I‚Äôm absolutely lost at this point. Does anyone have any idea or has anyone been through this?","self","https://redd.it/ypxy5y"

# TRON continues to BUILD

1. **TRON hosted its very first hacker house at Harvard University**. It was a great success and one of the goals of TRON is to get more young bright minds involved in blockchain technology. The academy track within the TRON Grand Hackathon Season 3 was made for students all over the world to start developing on the blockchain and get involved.   


[Harvard University Hacker House event Nov 12  - 13](https://preview.redd.it/3fgu8yznfwz91.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbf7598b1e5353882cf3af9d63a0deca3aa07336)

2.  **The TRON Grand Hackathon Season 3 is almost at a close.** Tron has hosted 3 Hackathons so far. Each improving upon the past. These are no small prizes as well. The $1,000,000+ prize pool is quite competitive with other popular blockchain hackathons hosted by Solana, Polygon and Near. 

We all know TRON's weak point is the amount of Dapps that currently reside on it. Getting more developers and those of quality is one of TRON's priorities.   


There will be a season 4 next year. 

Season 3 [https://trons3.devpost.com/](https://trons3.devpost.com/)

3.  **TRON DAO has also initiated grants.** There is a developer grant, ambassador grant, and influencer grant. These grants are there to further promote the blockchain within developer groups, communities, and those who wish to create content about TRON. 

There is a $1 billion ecosystem fund as well for bigger projects that need continued support for developing on TRON. 

You can see them here [https://trondao.org/grants/](https://trondao.org/grants/) 

[Grants](https://preview.redd.it/2n6qwdnrtwz91.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9708e5999ce0807186c171c67d6bf10f0ca70a9c)

4. **If you haven't noticed, TRON DAO is building a NA team.** TRON DAO / BitTorrent continues to hire through this terrible crypto market. This is a good sign to see continued job listings. If you want to work remotely in North America and bring a presence to TRON here, then you should consider the options

See jobs here [https://www.linkedin.com/company/trondao/jobs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/trondao/jobs/) 

**5. BitTorrent (Tron's L2) continues to develop.** They have recently released a relayer to make fast **decentralized bridge transactions** from TRON, BSC, and Ethereum.  They have also recently released a BTFS storage site and you can upload websites using BTFS storage. While they have a long way to gather market share from IPFS they are headed in the correct direction. 

BTTC Chain remains to be one of the cheapest and fastest blockchains, even cheaper than TRON. I can only see more infrastructure building there in the future. 

&#x200B;

6. **Justin Sun has positioned TRON nicely with USDD and Huobi.** As regulations on crypto open up in Hong Kong and hopefully to the rest of China eventually, Huobi is positioned nicely to take that market share and compete with Binance. More and more USDD pairs are being added on Huobi with 0 trading fees and it seems like USDD will be the stablecoin pair choice just like how Binance has BUSD on their exchange. 

With the recent doubts about exchanges though the future will most likely look towards DEXs. 

&#x200B;

[USDD Pairs](https://preview.redd.it/fy8o08u2rwz91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0c61b873c302edc9e7ef2fa769d129a5ef67ea6)

7. [Sun.io](https://Sun.io) and [sunswap.com](https://sunswap.com) continue to burn $SUN from LP fees. While it is small for now as more people adopt TRON it will continue to grow. The DEX has **future plans to bring in decentralized margin + perpetual trading as well**, as performed on other chains. This will bring in a lot more utility to those wanting to trade on TRON. They also want to make it cross-chain. 

You can see all the future improvements they want to make to the dex here on page 14 Future plans [https://sun.io/docs/SUN\_V2\_Whitepaper\_en.pdf](https://sun.io/docs/SUN_V2_Whitepaper_en.pdf) 

&#x200B;

[SUN Future plans](https://preview.redd.it/dntngvmvpwz91.jpg?width=990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c83c0307f84ef4f7566413dd362c9ada6497f33)

8. Adoption by Dominica was the first step to getting adoption by countries. This makes TRON tokens legal within Dominica as a means of exchange. While Dominica is small, this could lead to more Caribbean countries adopting TRON as a blockchain.  Depending on how TRON plays its cards this is a great first step to more legal/regulatory acceptance. 

&#x200B;

[Dominica](https://preview.redd.it/en2jpyddqwz91.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=109b14eb9165adbf6b2fa34da22308dacfd64e31)

9. TRON still has a massive grasp on the stablecoin market. Being one of the quickest ways to transfer USDT amongst exchanges TRC20 has become a standard for people even if they don't know they are using it. Not as big as Ethereum though. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/52p3qprhrwz91.jpg?width=1349&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30eea8d71bf405929cf6f74ee8210ddc1864e93d

10.  While there might be not a lot of dapps on TRON. There are few passionate projects. I personally know of long-term builders such as [TURUGlobal](https://twitter.com/TuruGlobal) , [JustMoney](https://twitter.com/JustMoneyIO), [DCloud](https://twitter.com/dCloudStorage), [USTX](https://twitter.com/USTX6), [Tronbies,](https://twitter.com/tronbies) and more. These people are highly passionate and have continued to build on TRON. A lot of the community projects are listed on JustMoney's dex. 

TRON understands the future will be multi-chain which is why they created the BitTorrent Chain so it only makes sense that projects on TRON should also not restrict themselves to only TRON. TRON is a great place to start though. 

I could continue on but.....the building never stops. 

So take this time in the current markets.... make a list of crypto you want to buy, doesn't have to be TRON. It could be a diverse portfolio.  Then just start....

Proposal 79 has 18 votes:  [https://tronscan.org/#/proposal/79](https://tronscan.org/#/proposal/79)   (18 votes leads to proposal being adopted)

It will go into effect  2022-12-04.

Some thoughts mostly based off the **github link above** and comments there:

The unit price of energy has been raised three times and every time it has lead to an increase in the amount of TRX staked.   [https://tronscan.org/#/data/charts/OverallFreezingRate](https://tronscan.org/#/data/charts/OverallFreezingRate) 

With TRON you can freeze TRX to obtain Bandwidth or energy.   TRON bandwidth allows you to perform transactions on the TRON mainnet without paying any gas fees/transaction fees.     Energy is a resource used to process smart contracts on the TRON network.  Smart contracts consume Energy in addition to Bandwidth.    [https://support.token.im/hc/en-us/articles/4404302141721-What-is-TRON-Bandwidth-and-Energy-](https://support.token.im/hc/en-us/articles/4404302141721-What-is-TRON-Bandwidth-and-Energy-)

 In the case of this proposal, Part of what makes TRON different is the ability to stake TRON to obtain energy to process smart contracts on the TRON network for free. Will changing the unit price of energy lead to the number of energy obtained by staking TRX to increase? The proposer seems to think so. Will it lead to a staking rate over 51%? Seems like that could happen over time anyways. 

Is TRX's main focus going to be on stable coin/currency transfers (with free transactions coming from staking TRX) ?  Will the majority of DAPP development focus for TRON be moved to the BitTorrent chain whose BTTC's token is built on Tron, with energy fees increasing?

The good news is they can try out different things and see what the results are and than pivot if needed.   The changes illustrate the importance of the way staking works on TRON.

It is also interesting to view the proposal history.  [https://tronscan.org/#/proposals](https://tronscan.org/#/proposals)

In August of 2021 it was proposed to increase the energy fee to 420 sun but it failed to get enough votes.  In October of 2021, 280 sun energy fee was passed.","self","https://redd.it/zav17s"

Transactions on the Tron network have also grown to a total of 4.33 billion with a weekly increase of 46.61 million new transactions.  The report revealed that the total value locked (TVL) on Tron has skyrocketed to $9.6 billion. By comparison, Tron's TVL was at $9.4 billion in last week's report.

The report highlights another week of positive growth for the network, especially in terms of adoption and utility. Tron is also driving growth through partnerships and real-world development. For example, the network just announced that it has partnered with Huobi to launch the Dominica coin as the first national fantoken.

Since I changed my votes over, I haven't had a single transaction show up on tronscan. Was the TRX being sent to me bonus TRX from that SR on TOP of the voting rewards?

My voting rewards seem to be going up (I used them all 5 days ago and now I have more) but no transactions - so - where can I see a log of my earned voting rewards for each day if they're not in transactions or transfers?

we created a fun game at [TRXflip.com](https://TRXflip.com). The purpose is to demonstrate how incredibly fast the Tron Network is, the fastest crypto in top 100 in our experience. This means you can play games in real time and receive payments back almost instantly, something other networks are not capable of. This means you don't even need to create any account and deposit any coins, you can play from the wallet of your choice directly.

We think this is a great use case for the network. Give it a try and let us know. We plan on adding new, more complex games soon, with the same principle: real time and no account needed.","self","https://redd.it/zz0gks"

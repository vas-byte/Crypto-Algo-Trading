TRX InDepth Review Use Cases and Features New projects are emerging rapidly in the crypto industry One of the brightest representatives was the TRON platform which has been under development since 2017 The project is a platform for the operation of decentralized applications which in many ways surpasses Ethereum To understand all the features of TRON we suggest you dive deeply into its ecosystem What Is TRON TRON a highperformance decentralized blockchainbased operating system that allows developers to build highly efficient smart contracts Initially it was positioned as a social network but only of a new generation independent of any centralized management However TRON has gone far beyond its original vision And to date TRON is a popular smart contractcapable platform within which developers launch their decentralized applications and issue custom tokens TRON solves the scalability problem inherent in Ethereum by increasing throughput and shifting gas fees But it is quite difficult to compare TRON with Ethereum because their architecture differs directly TRON has a hierarchical system of accounts and many management functions available to network participants For the developer of smart contracts if we leave aside the blockchain TRON offers in fact a database with an accounting system access and logic that the contract developer controls TRON allows you to focus exclusively on the business logic of applications giving the developer almost all the necessary tools to work with accounts and their data That is why TRON can be called practically an operating system on the blockchain TRON Benefits Scalability The number of transactions processed per second is a significant problem for most blockchain platforms The limitation is that operations require each node to have a consensus for everything that goes through them Low speed negatively affects users TRON can provide about 10000 TPS due to the DPOS Delegated ProofofStake mechanism TRON Virtual Machine TVM TVM is a smart contract execution environment supporting the universal JavaScript language Initially TVM was a fork from EVM so it is almost 100 compatible with it Thanks to EVM compatibility Solidity developers can easily transfer decentralized applications and benefit from the scalability and costeffectiveness of TRON The crucial difference between TVM and EVM is that it uses the concept of Energy That is when performing transactions on TVM TRX is not consumed In addition the developers promise that in the future TVM will be compatible with all mainstream VMs The platform has the properties of an operating system The creators declared Ethereum the main competitor Ethereum works as a decentralized supercomputer TRON is an operating system a complex of interconnected programs convenient for developers and users How Does TRON Work TRON operates based on the Delegated ProofofStake DPOS protocol This is a consensus algorithm in which coin holders choose a group of network validators by voting As a result a large list of candidates is created Participants have their own rating the number of votes received The final block producer group is created consisting of 27 Super Representatives Voting is one of the types of transactions The user signs the transaction with a private key indicating the candidate and sends it to the network as a regular transaction To participate in the procedure it is necessary to maintain a fixed number of tokens on the account constantly If you withdraw coins the results will be canceled Every 6 hours Super Representatives are reelected Super Representatives receive rewards for verifying and packing all transaction data broadcasted on the network A new block is released every 3 seconds and contains 16 TRX Block Rewards Nodes selected by users share part of the reward with those who voted for them TRON Transaction Fees The difference between TRON from other cryptocurrencies is that transactions are free There are no fees charged for the transactions performed Instead some of the system resources are reserved for processing outgoing transactions TRON differs from other platforms by its architecture From a technical point of view it is a server with multiple hardware processors RAM bandwidth Users can reserve resources for their needs 5000 bandwidth points are allocated to the user every day The regular transaction consumes part of the bandwidth points In case of exhaustion of daily points users can freeze their TRX to get more bandwidth points If the user has not frozen TRX and his bandwidth points have been exhausted the protocol charges TRX from the senders account Smart contract transactions consume Energy Users need to freeze TRX to get a daily energy limit to make a smart contract transaction This solution allows the network to increase capacity without changing the cost of transactions TRON Tokens The native TRX coin is issued on the TRON blockchain and is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain and its virtual machine TRX does not have a maximum limited supply at the time of writing about 93 billion TRX are in circulation TRX is used to issue rewards receive bandwidth points and Energy participate in voting as a medium currency for all TRCbased tokens and as a unit of calculation in the products of the TRON ecosystem NFT marketplaces DeFi lending markets and so on To counteract inflation in addition to staking a burning mechanism is used As already mentioned transactions in the TRON network consume bandwidth points and Energy If users do not have enough bandwidth points or Energy to cover the resources needed to complete the transaction they are required to burn TRX Thus TRX is permanently from circulation In addition TRON provides several TRC token standards to enhance the capabilities of all types of transactions inside and outside the network The main TRC token standards are TRC10 The most developed token standard initiates transactions in the blockchain It allows you to perform operations at a low price without using the TRON Virtual Machine TVM To issue TRC10 tokens the user must pay 1024 TRX TRC20 An improved version of the TRC10 standard The standard allows for cryptocurrency transactions on the TRON blockchain for example USDT TRC20 USDC TRC20 BTT etc Its function is similar to TRC10 The only difference is that it is connected to the TRON Virtual Machine TVM This token standard is compatible with ERC20 TRC721 This is the standard for issuing nonfungible tokens NFTs TRC721 is fully compatible with ERC721 Closing Thoughts Many DeFi projects today are moving away from Ethereum towards less loaded blockchains and TRON is one of them It has several advantages Freedom of data Users have power over their smart contracts applications and content Safe and censorshipresistant High throughput Up to 10000 transactions per second No fees Zero fees for everyday needs and freezing TRX for resourceintensive tasks with the possibility of a refund Popularity TRX is listed on many cryptocurrency exchanges and is used by developers ICOs Users can conduct fundraising on the platform Support for the universal JavaScript language Compatibility with Solidity Developers are working hard to make the network easy to use For example TRX has successfully integrated some services allowing users to tip content creators with TRX Peiwo pay for travel Alternative Airlines Travala pay for purchases Spend credit card Coinsbee and even pay for adult services Pornhub In addition many popular DeFi protocols have been launched on the TRON for example decentralized stablecoin lending platform JustStable SunSwap DEX oracle project WinkLink and others Moreover such popular stablecoins as USDT and USDC function on the TRON blockchain allowing users to make fast and costeffective transactions Thanks for reading The article was originally written for SimpleHold Blog,Bullish,0.6857174038887024

State of TRON WHAT IS HAPPENING Obviously the crypto market is in a state of winterrepair While everyone is busy talking about regulations fallen exchanges and spreading fear and terror You have to stop and think about how you can benefit from this opportunity Prices of crypto are cheap These types of prices are what people wanted to buy long before when we were at alltime highs You dont want to be buying the projects that go out of business but I can say for certain TRON is not one of those projects TRON continues to BUILD 1 TRON hosted its very first hacker house at Harvard University It was a great success and one of the goals of TRON is to get more young bright minds involved in blockchain technology The academy track within the TRON Grand Hackathon Season 3 was made for students all over the world to start developing on the blockchain and get involved Harvard University Hacker House event Nov 12 13 2 The TRON Grand Hackathon Season 3 is almost at a close Tron has hosted 3 Hackathons so far Each improving upon the past These are no small prizes as well The 1000000 prize pool is quite competitive with other popular blockchain hackathons hosted by Solana Polygon and Near We all know TRONs weak point is the amount of Dapps that currently reside on it Getting more developers and those of quality is one of TRONs priorities There will be a season 4 next year Season 3 x200B 3 TRON DAO has also initiated grants There is a developer grant ambassador grant and influencer grant These grants are there to further promote the blockchain within developer groups communities and those who wish to create content about TRON There is a 1 billion ecosystem fund as well for bigger projects that need continued support for developing on TRON You can see them here Grants 4 If you havent noticed TRON DAO is building a NA team TRON DAO BitTorrent continues to hire through this terrible crypto market This is a good sign to see continued job listings If you want to work remotely in North America and bring a presence to TRON here then you should consider the options See jobs here 5 BitTorrent Trons L2 continues to develop They have recently released a relayer to make fast decentralized bridge transactions from TRON BSC and Ethereum They have also recently released a BTFS storage site and you can upload websites using BTFS storage While they have a long way to gather market share from IPFS they are headed in the correct direction BTTC Chain remains to be one of the cheapest and fastest blockchains even cheaper than TRON I can only see more infrastructure building there in the future x200B x200B 6 Justin Sun has positioned TRON nicely with USDD and Huobi As regulations on crypto open up in Hong Kong and hopefully to the rest of China eventually Huobi is positioned nicely to take that market share and compete with Binance More and more USDD pairs are being added on Huobi with 0 trading fees and it seems like USDD will be the stablecoin pair choice just like how Binance has BUSD on their exchange With the recent doubts about exchanges though the future will most likely look towards DEXs x200B USDD Pairs 7 Sunio and sunswapcom continue to burn SUN from LP fees While it is small for now as more people adopt TRON it will continue to grow The DEX has future plans to bring in decentralized margin perpetual trading as well as performed on other chains This will bring in a lot more utility to those wanting to trade on TRON They also want to make it crosschain You can see all the future improvements they want to make to the dex here on page 14 Future plans x200B SUN Future plans 8 Adoption by Dominica was the first step to getting adoption by countries This makes TRON tokens legal within Dominica as a means of exchange While Dominica is small this could lead to more Caribbean countries adopting TRON as a blockchain Depending on how TRON plays its cards this is a great first step to more legalregulatory acceptance x200B Dominica 9 TRON still has a massive grasp on the stablecoin market Being one of the quickest ways to transfer USDT amongst exchanges TRC20 has become a standard for people even if they dont know they are using it Not as big as Ethereum though x200B 10 While there might be not a lot of dapps on TRON There are few passionate projects I personally know of longterm builders such as TURUGlobal JustMoney DCloud USTX Tronbies and more These people are highly passionate and have continued to build on TRON A lot of the community projects are listed on JustMoneys dex TRON understands the future will be multichain which is why they created the BitTorrent Chain so it only makes sense that projects on TRON should also not restrict themselves to only TRON TRON is a great place to start though I could continue on butthe building never stops So take this time in the current markets make a list of crypto you want to buy doesnt have to be TRON It could be a diverse portfolio Then just start TLDR Stay

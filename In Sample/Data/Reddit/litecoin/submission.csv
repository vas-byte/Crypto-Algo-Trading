However, I’m missing some more user facing and technical information. All I see is discussions about the release date, or what Mimblewimble is/does.

Im not interested in the “inner workings” of MWEB, but about the high level technical details of how it was integrated and how it can be used by users and developers:

- Which wallet(s) support MWEB?
- how can I get “private coins”? Do I have to buy them somewhere, or can I just use my LTC in the MWEB context for private transactions?
Who can I send private coins to? Any LTC address? 
- Is there documentation available how wallets can integrate the functionality? Any SDKs available?
- How are MWEB transactions displayed on block explorers? (Obviously private, but is it like Monero where you still see some metadata?) And have any explorers said they will support it?
- Will exchanges support MWEB?

Maybe I’ve looked in the wrong places, but I couldn’t find any answers to those basic questions. With the release just around the corner, I would have expected that most of these things are ready or being worked on, but so far I haven’t heard anything.

The period I'm writing about was very dark for me. However, I have some extremely important questions I was hoping this community could help me answer. Or at least point me in the right direction. Important facts to note: I was a drug addict, xanax and codiene and cocaine. Super productive. No memory and very clutsy. I grew up in rural america and didn't have access to the technologies a lot of kids took for granted. My understanding of computers/crypto was LIMITED. I also was living a sketchy lifestyle and going through phone numbers like crazy.

&#x200B;

In late 2015 I got into bitcoin. I was originally using it to gamble, but after losing 1.29 Btc into a watching only wallet (no fucking seed) (still have it sitting there to this day), I decided to learn the fundamentals and it became clear it was a good investment. I threw around $7000 into BTC, sent it to good ole BTC-e. Grabbed some alts. Shortly after, I got a notification they were switching to coins-e. I have the emails to follow my story at this point on. 

&#x200B;

From BTC-e I withdrew 100.798 LTC to an address that hasnt moved since then. 

18.96 LTC to another that hasnt moved.

80.837 LTC to another address. 

and 47.903 LTC to another address. (following emails all on the same day)

&#x200B;

so either the LTC was moved to a wallet which im fucked, or it was moved to another exchange.  

&#x200B;

I also withdrew 999,999,999 DOGE to a paperwallet, which I did have the email to. Unfortunately, I dumped all of them I was released prepump -\_- (sold doge late 2017), FTC, NMC, and Peercoin. Not worried about them. 

&#x200B;

Its now Jan 1, 2016

&#x200B;

If I remember right, I sent the LTC and few other alts I withdrew from BTC-e to Celery or GliPH, or a mobile exchange wallet, but was arrested a month  later and never had time to solve it. 

&#x200B;

My computer was ruined literally- someone spilt codiene and sprite on the laptop and fried the hardrive they said. I had usb backup, (but the shell and soldering broke) so wallet files werent an optionon the laptop (didnt know that then admittedly), but it was unrecoverable they said. my paper seeds were lost or srcambled or short, because family moved my things for me and bad storage of seeds. I maintained a lot of seeds with words that ring bells, but havent been able to find any LTC or BTC client that will allow me to sweep the seeds I have. i remember backing up my seeds between my desktop and laptop, but I was incarerated for two years and lost access to email addresses, and wasn't paying for the cloud service. 

&#x200B;

I have a fair shot of guessing the extra word, or passwords. 

&#x200B;

No access to old PC's, I have my old pc's MAC and IP address, not sure If I could get lucky and recover the files remotely. But no telling where it is.

What ways are possible for fund to disappear on that app. And over all how safe is it for long term investing of coins.  


Secondly.  While I mainly got it for Xmr, I decided I will put a large stash of Btc into it as well. but Ltc I do not know to much about how it's built or the long term potential of it. Right now it is at a great price to stock up on but what would be the reasons not to if any.

So having acknowledged these points, and knowing that nonetheless there are countless other newbs and/or lazy and/or daunted people such as myself out there who are curious about crypto, I noticed that LiteCoin is one of only four coins available on Paypal, and I'm contemplating buying some.

It seems to be very easy to do, so much so that I can't help but think that LiteCoin being one of the only four available coins there must be beneficial to the coin's health as a whole, as other people like me will also buy some due to utter convenience.

While so many are fixated on the ltc usd/btc pairing (yeah, I admit I watch it as well) I am mostly over the ""price action"" (for now).  Litecoin's imminent upgrade offers **immediate** benefits such as tor v3 support, improved transaction handling, taproot support (pending activation) and other improvements inherited from daddy Bitcoin.

But wait, there's more!  Litecoin gets to exclusively flex MWEB - something no other major chain has had the gumption to develop.  MWEB's ability to **seamlessly** pass your Litecoin in and out of **private transactions** with automatic peg-in/peg-out, while **simultaneously improving network scalability**, is an absolutely mind-blowing advancement.

David, Charlie and the entire Litecoin dev back-end team have shown why Litecoin is so important in the cryptocurrency  space - pushing a major network such as Litecoin to function as a fungible, private cash equivalent is a bold and vital component of hard digital money. **Litecoin again leads the way**.

There are strong headwinds pushing against Litecoin.  Want to damage Bitcoin?  Start by trying to kill its sibling and strongest ally, Litecoin - the network most capable of evolving quickly enough to actualize Satoshi's vision of a **decentralized** PoW chain **performing as real cash**.

So, while we await the official code drop, node upgrades and miner signalling for MWEB, lets all remember... irrespective of the market price, Litecoin is one of the primary reasons why secure, permissionless digital currencies will succeed... and we are all a part of it - right here, right now.

Arise, chickun.  Chickun, arise!  ;-)

One was a Micheal Saylor interview where he's convinced that many smart contract crypto's will be classified as unregulated securities in the US.

This may lead to a crackdown on the crypto industry surrounding them like exchanges, payment processors etc

I was watching an interview with Anatoly Yakovenko founder of Solana where he was asked what would happen if smart contracts built on the Solana or the Solana chain itself was used for criminal/ illegal intent/ storage. He struggled to answer.. which made me think that the more complex and feature full a platform is.. the more it probably does expose itself to regulatory pressure in the future.

Another interview was with Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum when he was asked with so many Cryptos how can you tell the scams from the legit projects. He actually mentioned Litecoin by name as an obvious crypto that's not a scam. This lead me to think about how it was fairly launched and in fact Charlie doesn't own any so can't be accused of shilling for personal gains... where many others could be if regulatory pressure intensified. 

Lastly was another with Charlie Lee himself.. saying that he quite liked Litecoin because it was relatively boring and stable as a currency, not like stablecoins that aren't a store of value like Litecoin and exposed to central bank printing, or highly volatile meme coins. It got me thinking that stablecoins themselves are already under regulatory pressure for representing the dollar and also being accused of manipulating their supply themselves. 

If regulation goes full tilt against crypto you could see it seriously impacting the valuations of many of the crypto's sitting above Litecoin... stranger things in crypto have happened. 

In the long-term Litecoin probably will face less regulatory pressure and scrutiny.","self","https://redd.it/sgs2en"

It is also possible that someone steals the idea😁

For some time now, I have been trying to research and build a mobile Application that will enhance P2P market in Africa and I discovered unique differences about the exchange rates of different companies and countries.


***I will be using Nigeria as the case study.***

Exchange rates of Dollar to naira

Black Market - $1 = 570 Naira
Most Banks - $1 = 490 Naira
International Bodies, CBN, PayPal - $1 = 420 Naira

Most Crypto lovers around Africa are forced to buy dollar from the black market and then convert it to the needed Cryptocurrency.

This App tends to connect foreign Litecoin whales(or people ready to sell Crypto) to Local crypto lovers in Nigeria and Africa at large.

We plan on creating an international P2P market. Where Litecoin can be converted  to any flat note.

People in Africa and other areas of the world where Cryptocurrency is limited and not formally accepted as a legal tender can make direct transfers or card payments to Paypal or Payoneer accounts of whales and the whales(Litecoin Owner) will send the required amount of Litecoin. This approach will be cheaper than Buying Litecoin in Binance(for Nigerians and others).

***Verification***
To reduce scammers, every seller on the International P2P market will be verified and fully registered. Limits and rates will be placed on sellers depending on their activities.

*** Software Dev ***
We plan on making the project open source so that more people can contribute and direct the course of this idea.

*** Budget ***
No fixed amount. If the project is approved, we may receive donations to support the open source developers and to increase the code quality.

*** Audience ***
All Africas and Areas where Cryptocurrency is not a legal tender and are interested in buying Crypto.

*** Litecoin ***
Because of the cheap gas fee, we plan on using Litecoin as the standard digital value in the P2P system 

Conclusion 
I believe deeply that most ""Africa Crypto Buyers"" will immediately adapt this approach in buying their digital Assets because of low expenses.

I'm open to hear from us all.

Thank you.

These reports come as a result of the Director of Financial Stability Elizaveta Danilova’s call to ban crypto. The central bank has since released a 37-page report outlining the reasoning behind this proposal. 

Politics are local, laws are national, and currency/value is international, and therein lies the inherent problem with the outlined proposal. 

The Report in a Nutshell 

A key criticism within the report was the market volatility of cryptocurrencies, highlighted on page 23. However, in this context the central bank fails to address activities such as gambling or stocks with the same level of scrutiny. This is the common underlying theme throughout the document, along with several other key points with similar shortcomings. The report paints crypto as one of the main destabilizing threats to the Russian economy, while loosely aided by the idea that people would invest all of their hard-earned money into Bitcoin, a high-risk asset. While the report goes into further detail, no projections or supporting documents were provided to validate such claims. 

The report goes on to mention that Bitcoin and crypto transactions in general are often used for illicit activities, on page 27. However, the reality is that any form of monetary transaction can be used for such purposes. In fact, it was recorded that in 2021, only 0.15% of crypto transactions were used for illicit purposes. This contradicts the claim that crypto undermines monetary policy, not to mention that it doesn’t align with Russia’s civil code, which recognizes crypto mining as a form of entrepreneurship. 

Additionally, the report raised concerns associated with crypto mining’s high energy consumption and its negative effect on the environment. This point is heavily used throughout the report as a backbone for reinforcing its stance on the crypto ban, while entirely ignoring the possibilities of exploring green and renewable energy solutions that could be researched and funded by Russia’s crypto mining industry. 

The report also seemingly throws around various claims, such as that 0.1% of all miners control over 50% of the Bitcoin mining industry in the country (page 23) without citing any credible sources for such information, and failing to acknowledge that some of the biggest miners in the country are publicly traded companies. There are a plethora of other false statements as well, including that stablecoins are not backed by anything and aren’t regulated (page 24), when in reality stablecoins like Circle USDC are fully regulated and legally redeemable. 

What is the goal of the ban? 

The proposed ban has no intent to ban crypto outright. ""We note that we do not suggest that holding cryptocurrencies by citizens be banned,"" Danilova stated according to TASS, Russia's state media, adding that there are fraud risks, as well as difficulties in asserting rights when acquiring cryptocurrency on foreign crypto exchanges. 

What the ban is targeting instead is to prohibit the issuance of tokens, crypto mining, trading activity that uses the country’s existing financial infrastructure, and prohibiting institutional investors from investing in crypto. 

Russia is currently the world’s third biggest crypto miner by hashrate, just behind the US and Kazakhstan. As mentioned earlier, crypto mining is defined and officially recognized by its civil code, and has immense potential for stimulating a significant economic growth for the nation, should it be embraced. 

Panic Amidst Misunderstanding 

To make matters worse, a number of sources have contributed to the spinning of this story by saying that Russia is banning crypto, including an article by Forbes that incorrectly states (and spells) that “Russian is the third nation to crackdown on cryptocurrencies over the last year, following China and Kazakhstan.” The Forbes commentary isn’t true, and while Kazakhstan did face nationwide power disruptions, it in fact did not crack down on mining and crypto and, as of today, neither has Russia. 

What does it boil down to? 

While the report by the Russian Central Bank’s head of financial stability is 37 pages long, it in itself is just a proposal based on one’s fears and assumptions fueled by misinformation around issues that either do not exist or are not likely to happen. 

For such reasons, it is highly unlikely that the Russian government will take Elizaveta Danilova’s proposal seriously, as it simply lacks solutions and fails to outline any concrete next steps, not to mention that it would put the country on a backward trajectory seeing as Russia has just legalized cryptocurrencies in 2020. If such a ban were to go forward, it would reverse this legislation (which took nearly 10 years to pass), not to mention that it would take several years to implement. 

Such a decision would be counterintuitive, especially in light of recent calls by the US and its allies to disconnect Russia from SWIFT in the event of its invasion of Ukraine. The hypothetical situation has received widespread media coverage, and Russia’s exclusion from the international payment system would have catastrophic effects on its economy. This would in turn push Russia into mass crypto adoption. Should such events take place, it is highly unlikely that Russia would want to transact in CBDC (China’s digital currency) or the Yuan, and would instead have to rely on Bitcoin to transact with the world. 

It is likely that the Russian government understands that it would be far more beneficial to tax the mining industry rather than ban it. Such taxation would present opportunities for infrastructure expansions and reinvestments into green and renewable energy sources. Taxation could also come in the form of utility, or the licensing of mining facilities to use a Russian sponsored mining pool that would implement a tax in real time, further reinforcing the potential for significant economic growth. 

It seems that such potential is not far from being actioned on by the Russian government, with the Russian director for financial policy, Ivan Chebeskov, supporting the regulation of crypto as opposed to banning it. Chebeskov’s sentiment comes as a response to the central bank’s proposal, further indicating the unlikelihood of an outright ban. He further outlines: “We need to give these technologies the opportunity to develop. In this regard, the Ministry of Finance is actively involved in the development of legislative initiatives in terms of regulating this market.” According to Chebeskov, the ministry has prepared its own proposal, this one for the regulation of crypto and digital assets, and is awaiting feedback from the government. 

Industry Experts Weigh In 

“The Bank of Russia conducts its activities independently from other federal bodies of state power, regional authorities and local governments”, meaning they do not have a final say in local government activity and would have a hard time banning utility companies from providing power to mining operations. 

Across the entire report, crypto mining in particular is mentioned only a handful of times and within the context of energy consumption. On page 4 of the report, a brief summary of mining is provided and then swiftly dismissed as a threat to the economy: “In this regard, according to the Bank of Russia, the best solution is to introduce these prohibitions on the mining of crypto-currencies.” No actionable solutions are provided, and the statement is followed by a summary of the Bank of Russia’s plan to develop their own digital currency. 

Roman Zabuga, PR director of mining hosting provider BitRiver, called the probability of an industry-wide ban “negligible”. 

A Widespread Misunderstanding 

While the call for a ban on crypto mining sounds daunting, it is important to note that this is currently no more than a proposal on behalf of the Bank of Russia, which would need to be approved by the government first. Such decisions are usually time consuming and initial proposals are often adjusted through compromise, or rejected altogether. 

Recent events in the industry have showcased a general lack of understanding for cryptocurrencies and mining on behalf of government bodies and other institutional leaders, as seen with Russia’s Central Bank. 

A recent House hearing on energy in crypto mining is another example, prompting Grant McCarty of Bitcoin Magazine to reiterate that Congress doesn’t yet hate Bitcoin: “This hearing didn’t signal malice on the part of Congress; it signaled a lack of education. These people just don’t know enough about Bitcoin to have that strong of an opinion yet [.]” 

In Conclusion 

The Russian Central Bank’s proposed ban is unlikely to pass as it clearly demonstrates the need for a better understanding of crypto within government bodies in order to allow for the technological advancements and economic spurts that are made possible by this developing industry. As a result, the proposal’s lack of credible sources and solutions stems from general fear, uncertainty, and doubt. 

The proposal has also prompted a swift response on behalf of Russia’s Ministry of Finance calling for proper regulation of crypto and digital assets, not a ban. President Putin has also briefly addressed this issue during a conference meeting on January 26, saying that Russia does in fact have a competitive advantage in crypto mining due to a “surplus of electricity and the well-trained personnel available in the country,” further adding to the improbability of a ban on crypto.

Even at the current exchange rate, it should have converted to $20 worth of Litecoin.

But only $12 bucks shows up as total balance. Turns out they kept $10 out of the $22 just to get started, sort of a like a fee, but there is more on that.

Okay, well that is ten bucks gone and you still haven't gotten a card. Now my balance says it has $12, but only $2 is spendable. That other ten bucks is to account for market fluctuation so that you don't go negative on your debit card balance. And to use the card again, you have to bring the balance above $10.

Next up. Your card isn't active yet. They say that your virtual card is included. But you have to pay an additional $10 to get the physical card and that is when they give you the details of your virtual card.

So basically you are spending $20 bucks just to get a card.

On top of that, something that is worth knowing in the small print. Is that there is a $5 monthly fee, which is waived if you spend more than $750 a month on non-cash or withdrawal transactions. 

To close the account, you initiate a withdrawal in light coin of the available balance. Remember the ten dollars you gave them, well they return it to you in a stellar token, not litecoin. 

I don't think this card is worth it. Being a debit card, I don't expect reward points or anything of the kind. But I do expect not to be nickeled and dimed left and right for a simple debit card. Considering that they are holding your money that more than likely is earning them interests. And they charge merchant transaction fees. Its not worth it.

In case you were wondering for security they use email for 2FA, nuff said there.

There are other crypto debit cards that don't force you pay fee (which goes towards a piece of plastic) just so you can have access to your virtual card. And don't charge you monthly fees just to keep the card active. With better security too. 


Needless to say. I'm closing out my card before I even bothered to fully activate it. I can at least regain most of my money, albeit half of it in the form of a token that is useless for me.

I hope this helps other redditors and saves them from losing time and money with bullshit hidden fees.

I'll update later if there is anything remarkable about the close out process.","self","https://redd.it/sjmgfa"

I've downloaded Litecoin core, synced up, put my 2013 wallet.dat file in place of the appdata/Litecoin/wallet.dat file that was downloaded with Core. I shut it down and started it back up and it shows nothing. I can't find any address, balance, or transaction history...though my old log txt files show there definitely was some.

I am unfortunately unable to do this, but we have a great community I'm sure someone has experience for this, and we have a LTC Foundation they can even pay someone to do it if no one does it for free.

I am somewhat new to litecoin and I am using [this](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/index.html) as a reference to what calls I can make on my full local node.  
Essentially, I want to create a list of all addresses in the litecoin transaction history that have completed any transaction.

As of now, the method I am thinking of using is the following:

1. getblockhash (to get block hash of a certain height)
2. getblock (gets block and its correlated transaction list)
3. gettxout (gets the transactions in a block)
4. repeat for the whole range of height (using getblockcount)

Of course, this would mean there would be redundant addresses during the scan. Would there be a faster way to obtain all the addresses or is this the only way?

Smart Bitcoiners are recieving first red flags on Bitcoin lacking built-in privacy solutions and as a result unable to be an ultimate tool in a fight with totalitarian government control.

We've had Andreas Antonopulous speaking about importance of privacy and sensorship resistance of sound money FOR YEARS. Yet I don't see any onchain improvements in that direction on Bitcoin protocol!

Now, privacy has it's ""risks"" - it slows down adoption:

1. Most governments will oppose privacy, ban and fight it very hard.
2. Centralized exchanges will refuse to list and may delist privacy focused coins. And we've seen that.

But what we're also seeing in the world, is how fast it becomes a MESS with governments going full control freaks and A LOT of people in need of SOLUTION. And this is the bullish case for Litecoin. But here it gets even more interesting.

With MWEB LTC becomes the most decentralized sound money with OPT-IN privacy solution. I wish it would be stronger though, but that may be a feature yet to come. What I really like is the fact Litecoin foundation acknowledging all that.  
And it's important to understand that the fact it is OPT-IN - centralized entities and governments are LESS likely oppose it, ban it, fight it at an early stage. Exchanges & stores can simply demand transactions in LTC to be open when you operate with them so they don't have to delist, slowing adoption.

Bitcoin may end up getting compromised by governments exploiting it's way too open nature. I strongly believe that the longer Bitcoin community hesitates, the harder it'll be for Bitcoin to reach positive consensus on privacy. So unless Bitcoin gets strong built-in privacy solutions withing the next \~2 years I'm heavily bullish on LTC future for years to come.

By spending LTC we decentralized the bag holders and introduce new users to the crypto space!

I plan on trying to ask people if they accept litecoin more and more!

The more people who have LTC the more litecoin will spread. These new people to LTC will also be able to spend it with other people! People say LTC needs marketing but I believe that we need some big spenders of LTC! Spending LTC is the best way to force new users to learn about LTC!

I bought a car with BTC.
I bought csgo skins with BTC and ETH.
I paid for taxis using BTC and LTC.
I pay for fb marketplace items using LTC.

The only way to be slowly accepted as a universal currency is by spending it!

So let's diversify and invest in our friends and family and spend our litecoin!

I usually ask people if they have a coinbase account to easily send LTC to them since it is the easiest way to send crypto nowadays. Hopefully the new users will DYOR. But we have to take chances! HODLING IS NOT THE ANSWER!!! Spend your coins and enjoy life a bit!","self","https://redd.it/syaxiy"

YOU CAN HELP! For those of you that aren't scammers, please help to downvote, report/flag and UNFOLLOW and block these scam accounts. Especially ones you see with Litecoin in their name. 

The majority of people in the world aren't very knowledgeable about crypto or litecoin and can be easily duped to send LTC to a scam address. 

Example (look at the replies to Litecoin's post): [https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1497983994465456129](https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1497983994465456129) if you don't see those replies, that means the counter actions have worked and twittersupport is actually doing something.

 You can keep on eye on this at: [https://litecoinsignals.quest/](https://litecoinsignals.quest/) 

The Update from Litecoin Talk (Link: [https://litecointalk.io/t/mweb-progress-update-thread/26678/348](https://litecointalk.io/t/mweb-progress-update-thread/26678/348))

""After a slightly bumpy start, MWEB has successfully activated on  testnet, and the chain is progressing forward. Thank you to Loshan and  Charlie for driving this effort, and to the LTC community for really  stepping up in a big way to help test and debug issues.

Speaking of which, there were a number of issues identified, mostly around:

## 1. Encrypted and non-HD wallets

Certain wallet setups were not able to generate stealth addresses  with rc1, and during some flows would actually crash. Fortunately, those  issues were found and reported right away, so we were able to get those  fixed quickly.

## 2. Mining APIs

The code for solo mining was written and tested long ago, but of  course, almost nobody solo mines these days. Mining is done through  mining pools, which use a slightly different method for getting new  mining jobs, and submitting new solutions. I didn’t have access to a  mining pool at the time to test, so the stratum changes just went  unimplemented. At least until last week.

Loshan and I worked together to code and test the mining API changes needed for pool mining, which he describes [here](https://twitter.com/loshan1212/status/1498042654722039812). If you know any pool operators, please point them there so they can be ready for mainnet activation.

## 3. Wallet Transaction List

There were a few bugs around transaction building that seem to be  fixed now, but most of the wallet issues are around how we display  transactions. Between Mimblewimble’s pruning and coinjoining, and the  way “pegging out” works with extension blocks, displaying the wallet  history is one of the most complex changes we’ve had to make for MWEB.

Pegging out actually splits sends into 2 transactions, which can make  for a very confusing history if we’re not careful. And I wasn’t very  careful… Immediately after testnet activation, people were confused by  the numbers of transactions and the amounts they were seeing. Fees  displayed incorrectly, credits and debits were unreliable, and some  really large or whacky numbers would appear at times. These were all  just display issues, not actual problems with the amounts sent/received,  but it didn’t make for a great user experience at all.

I’ve been doing my best to fix each of these issue as they’re  identified, and it’s finally starting to act a little more predictably.  We’ll continue to test and fix these issues until we’ve got a release  candidate that we’re 100% comfortable with. Once that’s the case, we’ll  create the full v0.21.2 release and start (gently) badgering node  operators to upgrade and miners to start signaling.""","self","https://redd.it/t6u65b"

Plays Axie Infinity in First Round","None",0.75,10,0,0,5,0," **6 seed Litecoin** is playing **11 seed Axie Infinity** in the first round of the 3rd Annual Ultimate Crypto Tournament!

Voting has begun and will run for 3 days. The coin with more votes will move on to the next round to play the winner of: **3. Solana** vs. **14. PancakeSwap**

For those unfamiliar, this is modeled after March Madness where the top 64 coins face off in a single elimination tournament. The winner moves on and the loser is out. The last coin left is declared the champion.

This is Litecoin’s third straight appearance in the crypto tournament! In 2020 it made it to the Sweet 16, losing to Final Four coin Tezos after defeating NEM and Holo. Last year, it survived a scar by Enjin Coin before falling to Monero in the second round. Tell your friends and maybe your frenemies; the more votes the better!

This is a real event, not spam and it’s just for fun. I know that different coins have different functions so it’s sometimes silly to ask “which is better,” but I’m still doing it because I think it’s fun. If this isn’t the type of post for this subReddit, I apologize and won’t post here again.

Good to see the community thriving. I'm currently working on a project called [http://metamouse.cc/](http://metamouse.cc/) and I was hoping to get some honest feedback from the community.

The project allows paying fiat invoices with crypto, including LTC. In short, the service works like this:

1. You receive an invoice that you can pay with a bank transfer. 
2. You go to our service, input the amount, payment details and choose the currency you want to pay with.
3. You send the crypto to the designated address
4. One of our partners pays the invoice.

The benefit of using the service is that you don't need to convert crypto to fiat yourself and can easily make cross-border payments.

This is a side project of [AlterCap](https://altercap.com), a licensed crypto exchange, so we can assure the service is safe to use.

Since the launch we at CoinRabbit set ourselves on an ambitious goal — to expand the crypto market adoption and provide as many different assets with more new use cases as possible.

As we approach a huge milestone and list new assets **on a daily basis** we expect **300+ assets** to be provided with crypto loans and crypto deposits features further on.

Short list of our features:

* **No sigh ups** or credit checks needed
* **No KYC.** We do not gather **any** personal information
* Different types of solutions for **all** types of market conditions
* **Our own** special risk-control & security systems implemented. **Security of funds is our first prio**
* **Lightning-fast** (unlike Nexo, for example). Receive and start using funds within 10 minutes
* **Unlimited** time frames. It is up to you to decide when to get your collateral back
* **No hidden fees**

We have strong partnerships with reputable crypto projects such as ChangeNOW, Guarda Wallet, Cake Wallet, and already work directly with several worldwide known crypto issuers (*it would also be great to connect and work directly with the Litecoin Foundation one day!*)

So, the question is: **would any of you guys be interested in LTC-backed crypto loans?**

Right now we are able to list LTC within a **single day.**

We would be grateful for literally any feedback — be it positive or negative. If you want it, let us know. If you have any conserns, PLEASE let us know. Cheers!","self","https://redd.it/tlkek3"

There has never been any major scandals involving the Litecoin development team. LTC is evenly distributed between many holders not just a few select whales. Litecoin has some of the fastest and cheapest transactions of any blockchain. LTC is tradeable on most major cryptocurrency exchanges globally.

My friends and I recently started [Finsheet](https://finsheet.io/), which provides financial data for spreadsheet users.

We have real-time and historical price for Litecoin in many leading crypto brokers. For example, these functions would return real-time price of Litecoin on Binance and Coinbase:

* FS\_Latest(""BINANCE:LTCUSDT"")
* FS\_Latest(""COINBASE:LTC-USD"")

These 2 functions would return intra-day (1 hour) price of Litecoin from the beginning of today (04/01/22) until now:

* =FS\_CryptoCandles( ""BINANCE:LTCUSDT"" , ""60"" , ""04/01/2022"")
* =FS\_CryptoCandles( ""COINBASE:LTC-USD"" , ""60"" , ""04/01/2022"")

I write down the login identifier - wallet address - and private key on a lined index card.

I put the cards in my safe.

This method has been flawless up until now.

Here's where it gets weird.

There were 100 LTC in one wallet and 100 LTC in the other.

I have 2 index cards both wrote in the exact same style at the exact same time. 

Unfortunately the passwords I am entering are not granting me access to either  of the 100 LTC wallets, nor the past wallets that i keep saved even though they are empty, just for reference.

The next step I execute is to download ELECTRUM wallet and sweep/import keys.

ONE of the wallet's private keys works and the 100 LTC is now in a different wallet.

Here's The Problem:

Just to be clear, none of my wallets have been compromised, no extras curricular activity. The coins are indeed where they should be (well, not exactly)

The other wallet who's keys are written down doesn't work. The option to sweep/import stays greyed out.

LitecoinCore returns a similar error along the lines of ""unable to decrypt""

The next route I am contemplating is a bruteforce on Litevault because I know for sure there are only a certain combination of passwords I use but maybe missing a Capital Letter.

Can anybody suggest my best options.","self","https://redd.it/tup25q"

One important thing is that you can create wallets with any n-of-m schema there. It supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Binance Smart Chain and more.

Multisig wallet creation happens off-chain, a bit similar to how it is done in Bitcoin protocol. One advantage that threshold signatures gives is that transactions looks like a single user transaction, so group privacy is preserved.

In the nutshell it works the following way: all participants generate their own private keys, then they derive their respective public keys and share with others. The group public key is literally a sum of participants public keys. When they need to sign a transaction they calculate their individual share of r and s values of a signature. This way they literally can just sum up their signature shares and get a group signature. This approach is called multiplicative-to-additive transformation and is a scope of multi party computation (MPC).

1 units is 800$ CAD with the PSU they came with. Extra 30$ for a new server PSU and breakout board.

You can DM me for my contact info. 

They came from a mine in china during the last ban wave. Have been flashed with HiveOS for easy monitoring while needing to get rid of the virus they all came with.

You can come and pick up in Alberta. Shipping available in North America.

Historically, LTC was more profitability than dogecoin, but in 2021, Dogecoin is now more profitable to mine Check it out here: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/mining_profitability-doge-ltc.html#log&alltime

What I am wondering is what DOGE and LTC price will be going forward now that it is more profitable to mine DOGE. Is this bullish for DOGE and bearish for LTC?

I think the clear answer would be that miners will sell DOGE and hodl LTC bc DOGE is more profitable to mine and sell, but I feel like that is happening. Rather, I feel like miners are hodling DOGE for price appreciation and selling LTC to fund their expenses. Since miners are the biggest cohort of sellers, their actions are v important for the price.

The key difference bw DOGE and LTC is that DOGE has no cap, its supply is infinite while LTC is capped at 84m coins. So long term, I would imagine that LTC would outperform, but I am not too sure of this either. LTC does have amble liquidity and is on most exchanges and is used on the dark net - so there is demand for it. But if users prefer DOGE and miners continue to dump LTC, then LTC could flounder like other merged-mined coins like Namecoin (RIP). 

One thing I am bullish on is the strength of the overall scrypt network. Due to the higher prices of DOGE - more scrypt miners are online so the merged LTC and DOGE chain is much stronger and the hashrate is approaching ATH. I think a stronger chain should lead to a higher price over the long-run. 

What is unique about this situation is that this appears to be the first time that a parent coin (LTC) in a merged-mined relationship was flipped by the child coin (DOGE). So LTC helped secure DOGE and prevent 51% attacks during its infancy, but now DOGE has grown up and is the dominate coin in both price and profitability. So does this spell the end for LTC?

My take: I think the market will notice that LTC is a secure chain that has value. However, I suspect that miners will continue to dump LTC and hodl DOGE in the near term, which will pressure LTC's price. Yet, overtime, I think DOGE inflation will put downward pressure on DOGE while still securing the network - Scrypt will continue to be a powerful PoW chain and LTC will retain value bc of that. Will LTC ever surpass DOGE in market cap? That is completely unknown but I think given the deflationary nature of LTC and the strength of other merged LTC-DOGE network, LTC should outperform in price over the long run (multiple cycles).","self","https://redd.it/uc4ief"

My backup works by converting each word of your seedphrase into its equivalent number using the BIP39 Standard, a static pool of 2048 words. Then you just grab a hammer or mallet and stamp the sequence of numbers into the plate.

Product: [https://cryptonumeris.com/products/plate-s](https://cryptonumeris.com/products/plate-s)

Original wordlist: [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt)

So instead of shipping 27 alphabetical stamps I just ship 9 numerical stamps (6=9).

I use AISI 304 Stainless Steel (Gauge 14) which has a melting point of 1450 °C (2642 °F) so I knew it would not melt, this was rather intended to be an endurance test against high temperature for a long period of time.

\*\*\*

Anyway, so one of my dad's friends runs a ceramics factory which manufactures Raku (his name is Juan), and he was kind enough to let me put one of my plates in one of the furnaces.

On **April 12 at 6:30 am the test had begun**, the furnace was on. Juan told me the peak temperature was gonna be reached at around 4:30 pm so I went to the factory at that time to photograph the live  furnace and the thermostat.

Please note that the furnace was turned off at 6:00 pm but remained closed until the next morning at 9:00 am, an extra 15 hours which I do not have the graph for, but it's safe to say it remained very hot inside the furnace for a good few hours after it was turned off.

# The Aftermath

On **April 13 at 9:00 am the test had concluded**, the furnace was practically at ambient temperature. The first pic was taken by Juan when they first opened the furnace. I got really anxious because you can barely see any marks on the plates so for a moment I thought they were completely done. I arrived at 11:30 am to the factory only to be surprised by the results.

# Result & Conclusions

The backup data was fully recovered, you can see all the numbers because the steel has almost all of its integrity even after being burned down for half a day.

After carefully reviewing both burned plates and the nature of this benchmark, I came to the conclusion that this test was a total success. I like that this ended up being an extreme endurance test that really shows the strength of the steel.

There's no secret, if the furnace would have reached a temperature of 1450 °C (2642 °F) both plates would have melted and redeemed irrecoverable. But realistically speaking, in what scenario would these crazy temperatures be reached? The average house fire temperature oscillates between 600 °C  and 800 °C (1100 °F - 1500 °F). [Source 1](https://firefighterinsider.com/house-fire-temperature-how-hot-does-it-get/) [Source 2](https://jacksonvillesafe.com/2019/07/do-you-know-what-will-not-burn-in-a-house-fire/)

I do not claim to be an expert in house fires but I firmly believe that 12 hours of high temperature is a long amount of time and proves that this grade of steel is suitable for this kind of application.

I would love to hear everyone's opinion on my test, was it good enough? I do believe it simulates a severe house fire. If you have any cool ideas for other benchmarks against steel share it in the comments!

Despite the existing of many other cryptocurrencies, Litecoin has a lot of advantages and here are just a couple of them: **High Transaction Speed, Low Fees, Enthusiastic Community.**

You are given the opportunity to connect to a Litecoin (LTC) node at any point in time when you utilize the blockchain-as-a-service offering by NOWNodes. What this essentially means is that if you have a genuine interest in launching a project that runs on top of the Litecoin blockchain network, you can easily keep track of anything and everything that occurs on top of the LTC network 24/7/365 due to the 99.95% uptime guarantee offered.

If you are developing a decentralized application (dApp), an analytical platform, or you just need your wallet to consistently be connected to the blockchain network in some way, you can easily get access to data such as block height, transaction status, wallet balances, and anything else you might require.

Every product in this category includes a small gift from us: **a free screenprotector**! And as always you get **3% off + free shipping EU-wide** if you pay **with Litecoin**!

If  you want to use LineageOS as a privacy friendly alternative to Android  the first hurdle is always to find a device that is compatible with the  latest version. If you have a phone that is called ""Somephone 10T Lite""  it is not the same as a ""Somephone 10T"" or a ""Somephone 10 Lite"" so if  you are not careful you can be in for an unpleasant surprise if you  bought the wrong one and you did not realize it before you tried to  install a custom recovery using fastboot. With the products in this  category you can be sure that you get a compatible device!

Of  course installing LineageOS can be a challenge in and of itself, it's  much more difficult than installing Ubuntu on a notebook and if you  don't follow the instructions ([https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/)) it can happen that you damage your new device. So please be careful because the device can lose its warranty!

And we also have another offer for you!

534 addresses own 67% of all Ł

Note: I like ltc, I’d like to accept it in my business and hold it on my balance sheet and I’m very optimistic on the longevity of an Ł/₿ combo for daily commerce and a store of value. 

My questions are:

Are you worried about LTC being centralized given that so few hold so much?

How do you reconcile this and still believe in LTC?

As he said that Bitcoin goes up over time because of mining expansion but because of merge mining and unlimited Doge supply, there is no pressure for Litecoin price to go up. So as long as miners are in profit because of Doge, LTC price will never reach it's potential

So is merge mining really good for Litecoin in the long term? And do you think it's a good decision to decouple from Doge?

Especially, when you consider the onchain Bitcoin transaction fee to get your Bitcoin into the Lightning Wallet. People seem to forget this expense. 

Also, transactions on the main chain has added security benefits since you are not relying on a 3rd party. Relying on a 3rd party requires additional trust, no matter how trustworthy that party seems.

So i want to discuss an important subject which is Silver to Bitcoin Gold.","None",0.78,20,0,0,21,0,"I understand why Charlie Lee explained it this way, maybe as a marketing strategy for new people to understand it. And it's really nice of him, great guy.

It does sound nicer saying "" Silver to Bitcoin Gold "" rather then "" Gold to Bitcoin Gold "" which sounds like a competition, but technically both are Gold in a parallel universe. So let me explain...

At some point in history thousands of years ago both were traded equally, there wasn't much difference between them. 

However as time went by, they figured out that Gold is more scarce on our planet and more expensive to mine. So technically since silver is less scarce and cheaper to mine, the inflation rate is higher with silver so Gold became more expensive.

As Gold became more scarce and expensive it made sense for governments to hold Gold. Why? Simply because it needs less space to store or move which makes it cheaper and more convenient to transport from location to location. 

If i could fit 1 million dollar of Gold in a small bag why would i need to hold Silver if i need a much larger bag to hold the same value? So Gold became a store of value and Silver became utility.

It really make me sad when Bitcoin maxis hurt Litecoiners by saying Silver isn't needed when there is Gold. Because while this hold true in commodities, the same rules don't apply in a digital world but they will use that against you at every turn.

Don't get me wrong i have nothing against a digital gold narrative for Bitcoin, and yes Silver isn't much needed in commodities when you have Gold as a store of value but it is irrelevant in the digital world.

When Bitcoiners mix what happened in the past in the history of Gold and apply that in cryptocurrencies to hurt Litecoin and protect their investments, this is something to be upset about. Because what hold true in real world doesn't apply in the digital world.

Because let's be real here, this is a digital world and the parameters are very different. 

1- Bitcoin and Litecoin eventually will have same inflation rate after each  halving.

2- The space needed to move transaction are almost the same. Litecoin is cheaper and faster tho.

3- Due to same inflation rate, they are both equally scarce. 21M vs 84M

Does this look like Gold and Silver to you? It certainly is not! 

To sum it up, Litecoin is not Silver. It does behave like Silver because we believe it is.

There is no universal rule that force humanity to invest in 1 Gold as long as both are equally good. Which is not the case in Gold vs Silver aka the metal.

Technically Bitcoin is Gold and Litecoin is Gold, they can both be gold as long as we believe it is.","self","https://redd.it/uuyb9d"

The blocks are containers of data. They can save all and any information about Litecoin transactions that were confirmed at a specific point in time.   
Traders and users who often buy and sell cryptocurrencies will utilize a block explorer with the intention of checking on the status of their transactions. This is due to the fact that once a user initiates a transaction they will receive an automatically-generated transaction hash which they can use to look up details of the payment and discover if it was actually successful.   


Keep in mind that miners can use the block explorer as well, as they can confirm block activity and check if they have been successful in the creation of a block after which they would receive a block reward.

Before we dive into the serious nature of this subject matter I find it appropriate to go over a few key points that should be kept in mind of the reader. This is the opinion of a user known as “Knight” and nothing more. Anything discussed here is meant to facilitate a vision of what Litecoin offers to the masses as a global solution.

Litecoin… it is a Decentralized fork of Bitcoin with benefits of speed, security, and scalability. But why do we need it? At first glance this is a good question and it took me a long time in crypto before i understood exactly what Litecoin is and what makes it a game changer. In order to understand why any crypto is needed there should be some perspective on the current state of the world and it’s monetary system of centralized power.

Fiat Currency:

For as long as humans have been on Earth we have found ways to exchange goods and services through mediums of exchange. We used stones, sticks, water, land, ect… anything that was of value to the next person of which you needed something from. As time evolved humans began to find more clever ways to do business and a more common medium: Gold! This was before any fiat currency was globally accepted as money. Gold or Silver would be sent by land or water to the places it needed to go and this could’ve taken a month or two depending on location, if not longer.

Time passed and we evolved to paper money (notes) which was used as a more portable option and far less risky. This paper backed money was only good because the banks had the gold to back it up and replace the paper if needed…Until 1971 when Nixon (President of the United States at the time) drove the world’s leading economy away from the gold standard and made it to where people could no longer take their paper and turn it into gold (real money)…

The Dark Ages:

Fast forward to the 2000s and you find a lot of the paper money that used to be backed by gold is not anymore and has been inflated to astronomical proportions. In 1913 a $1 would’ve bought you 16 loaves of bread ($0.06 per loaf), and in 2013 the price of that same loaf is…over $1. At the time of writing (2022) a loaf of bread is $2.74.

The buying power of the dollar has fallen drastically… from 1913 to 2013 you are talking about a 94% decline! This is the cancer of inflation, the root of financial woes and trouble… and who is Economy’s doctor from this? The Federal Reserve and Centralized banks.

Centralized Power:

How is it possible to just create more of something and deem it acceptable by everyone even though it devalues everyone else’s portion without their consent? Government. The Federal Reserve (the Fed) is an independent entity to the Federal Government, but… The Federal Government hires the people in charge of the Fed. And the Feds’ job is to regulate the financial structure of the economy managing the downturns and upswings. Keep in mind that the Federal Reserve is made up of humans and they make errors like everyone else. So in no way is this a proper system to manage the debts and credits of an entire global economy!

Your Bank:

Outside of the Fed regulations and how they inflate the dollar there is also the bank who thanks to the Fed and government can create “magic money” that really doesn’t exist.

Example. Say you have $100 and you put it in your bank. That bank now has control over that money and although when you check day and night your $100 stays there. But what you don’t see is what they do with your money. They loan it out to people and charge interest (for them)! so your $100 gets loaned to charlie with a fee… $97. Charlie then takes that and buys something with it… the merchant then puts that $97 into a bank…and yeah rinse and repeat. Now your $100 has been turned into $33,000 in the system, then that cash is used in the stock market to bet against the very loans they just gave you. No wonder it takes your bank days to process a transaction…

Bitcoin and Litecoin:

The problems above are the root of the cancer that eats away at society and takes it down a road of no return. Bitcoin when it was created had a Libertarian vision of returning to the old method of trade which was peer to peer not needing an intermediary (bank). This vision has been at the core of All of crypto, which is the financial freedom that each human seeks in their heart.

Litecoin as stated above is a fork (an update in simpler terms) of bitcoin and solves every major problem above!

Litecoin is a trusted network that runs by the community and for the community meaning there is no centralized authority on what should be done concerning it. Updates happen as needed and voted on by those working on the open source code! Litecoin also solves the problem of inflation because there will only ever be 84,000,000 LTC in existence and so the supply cannot be manipulated. Litecoin because of it’s speed can get a transaction through at the speed of light and with little to no cost to the user. When you receive your LTC in the wallet there is no one else who moves it around or manipulates it like a bank can do with fiat! It is yours and no one can move it except you! Litecoin also can be used as a payment through the wallet with the card feature so there is no need for a bank! With Blockchain as a monetary policy for a nation, it would eliminate the human potential for error and showcase that the Network knows best how to handle a global economy. From an information perspective it already does, look at google and how many people use it compared to an actual dictionary. Blockchain is no different! Humankind has been through cycle of cycle in a fiat spiral that regardless of how long you evade, it has one destination and that’s destruction. The system has been broken beyond repair and nature has give us a solution: Blockchain! It is the next evolution of a peer to peer infrastructure that will replace a Centralized authority of both monetary policy and social dynamics. Litecoin has already built the tech for the future and is only a couple of steps away from getting us to the vision that is Bitcoin and Litecoin. As soon as the wallet is able to accept a direct deposit and have the funds be converted into photons then the banks will no longer be needed and adoption is all that is left!","self","https://redd.it/v64tiq"

Or is this wallet misleading?","None",1.0,3,0,0,13,0,"Story starts around \~2 month ago when i purchased some LTC from a local atm vendor. Wanted to use the LTC<>XMR swap offered by CakeWallet so i created a new XMR wallet using the same name as LTC wallet( here it bugs, it looks like if you create 2 wallets with the same name, the first one gets broken, maybe overwritten, and becomes inaccesible). Before doing this i have opened the ""show seeds/keys"" menu in cake wallet and saved the PrivateKey. (LE [here](https://imgur.com/a/LMRP5EN) is what CakeWallet shows...from there i saved only the privatekey because i knew it's enough)(that is an empty wallet btw)

Before we get to the next part let's see what is a privatekey and how it works. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-private-key](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-private-key)

Everytime you submit a transaction on the blockchain, that transaction is signed with your privatekey, stored in your wallet app.

Ok, let's recover the wallet, I have the PK(privatekey) so it must be easy.....i thinked. Tried importing it in ElectrumLTC, LitecoinCore and Coinomi. The PK offered by cakewallet doesn't work in any of these apps, but LitecoinCore pops an error saying bad encoding. Ok, maybe it's a different encoding. I have used [https://liteaddress.org/](https://liteaddress.org/) to change the encoding of the PK and the result is a good privatekey that opens an empty wallet.

There must be only 2 possible scenarios from this situation: either i made an error when i saved the PK or the alphanumeric number offered by CakeWallet is not a real blockchain Privatekey(woot?!?). Good thing is that is easy to test. I made a new LTC wallet, sent some 1$ there, carefully wrote down the PK and then I tried importing it into other wallets. Same story as above so the conclusion is that:

The PrivateKey that CakeWallet displays to you when you access the ""show seeds/keys"" is not a real PrivateKey. **THIS IS WAY TOO MISLEADING!**

(I think that it's just a random alphanumeric number that cake generated internally and is using it to decrypt the real privatekey using the seeds...just my theory)

Now i have a ""PrivateKey"" that does nothing and a backupfile generated with CakeWallet that has my wallet with funds bugged on it. I tried to import the backup file in older versions of CakeWallet from github...not working. Next try was to build the source from github and try to workaround that error using Flutter. Looks like it can only be done by a flutter expert, the build tutorial pops a lot of errors and it's missing the command to build the new cw\_haven ([https://github.com/cake-tech/cake\_wallet/issues/337](https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet/issues/337)) . I am ok to hire a dev and help me recover the funds but the support fails to tell me if that wallet is forever destroyed or not. They say if I don't have the seed they can't do shit BUT FOLKS I HAVE THE PRIVATEKEY and that should be more than enough to recover the wallet using any LTC wallet..

&#x200B;

The main question is if this wallet is misleading or am i dumb?","self","https://redd.it/v6ynuf"

But according to Upbit and Bithumb crypto exchange, they had to stop supporting Litecoin (LTC), due to the activation of the MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB) update on the main Litecoin network, which is a protocol which increases privacy on the Litecoin (LTC) network as it uses several technologies, including confidential transactions and CoinJoin, which hides sender and receiver inputs and outputs, and combines multiple transactions into one.

According to Upbit, ""the decision to delist Litecoin (LTC) was guided by South Korea's Specific Financial Information Act, which requires exchanges to be able to check transactions for transparency in order to prevent illegal money laundering or blackmail financing.""","self","https://redd.it/v7x91v"

As Lee explained, it’s a “lite version of Bitcoin.”

In 2017, the Litecoin creator cashed out and sold all of his LTC. And the Litecoin survived!

Similar to Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin is developmental Bitcoins fork. It uses the same protocol as BTC.

What makes Litecoin stand out? It’s efficiency and speed. Although it is similar to Bitcoin, Litecoin’s algorithm was originally intended to create around four times as many coins as Bitcoin. Litecoin transaction processing is quite a bit faster than Bitcoin’s. LTC transaction confirmation time is about 2.5 minutes on average. BTC confirmation takes about 10 minutes.

Even though Litecoin is the #20 most popular cryptocurrency by the market cap, different studies show that customers want to see LTC as a payment option amongst BTC, ETH, and USDC options. Maybe that’s because initially, LTC was created as a cryptocurrency for convenient everyday payments.

Also, 9.3% of total payments made through CoinGate are in LTC. That makes it the 4th most popular currency for payments at CoinGate.  


Why do you think Litecoin stands out?

Hey guys, I'm the guy running crypto for the homeless. We recently just had our 3 year anniversary (4/28/19 start date) a couple months ago - this post is a little bit late.

For those of you who don't know, crypto for the homeless (CFTHL) is a non-profit organization I created with the intention of doing something unique with crypto while at the same time helping the needy.

I started it completely out of pocket at the start and was able to get the organization of its feet immediately due to the massive support shown from social media (mainly reddit).

I never set out to ""solve"" homelessness, as I think that is a systemic problem that even governments can not fix - but rather to re-introduce a human aspect of charity that I felt was sorely missing from most other projects (at least in my opinion).

We differentiated ourselves by utilizing all of the funds we received thus far on food/goods for the homeless, and also delivering food straight to the homeless/needy. In addition to this, we have photo documentation of all food hand outs as well as receipts dating back to the very first time we handed out food (3+ full years of photos at this point) which I believe no other charity has come close to doing.

While we had very humble beginnings, we are proud to have 501c3 status for 2+ years now, and also recently launched our brand new website [http://cryptoforthehomeless.com](http://cryptoforthehomeless.com/) (check it out).

We also have had a massive amount of volunteer support (people buy and hand out food for us and get reimbursed in crypto). Our partners in New Zealand have been doing the most amazing work consistently for us and I could not be prouder. [https://imgur.com/a/cBoAUNg](https://imgur.com/a/cBoAUNg) \- here is an album of some of their recent work.

In terms of donations, we have received enough (roughly $75,000 thus far) to last us probably a decade or more of work at our current rate (if we ration the spending to maintain our current rate), which I view as a massive success and also a guarantee of our longevity.

I've learned a ton from running this project thus far - and I've used a lot of it to try and improve the project if possible.

1. It is impossible to satisfy 100% of people with ANY project - for this one in particular, there are those who oppose helping homeless people in general and thus they will inherently hate this project no matter what I do.
2. It is impossible to make this project 100% ""trustless"" despite what most people who have that criticism say. It is ultimately a project based on human work, and the best that I/we can do is provide a massive amount of proof of work (which we have) that should be used as a basis of our legitimacy. At this point, having 3+ years of photos as well as documenting over $20,000 donations in monero should be more than enough proof of our legitimacy (in addition to reimbursing 100% of our volunteers who participated properly).
3. A lot of people want to steer the project in many different directions - ultimately the project's design is a very personal thing when it comes down to it. I personally created it with a very specific vision in mind - and that may not align with what you(or other people) feel the best vision is. That is perfectly fine - and you/they are free to create a project to carry out that vision in the same way I have carried out mine. Projects like this cost time/money and the very fact that enough supporters on the internet have funded this project to last us 10+ years now at least shows that we have a reason to exist. I am beyond grateful for this support and intend to respect the intentions of our donors for the extreme long term.

Which brings us to future plans -

We currently have a couple people including myself dedicating quite a lot of time each day working on the websites/social media/communicating with volunteer prospects/etc. There are actually a lot of things that occur behind the scenes that are very time consuming and we could use 1 or 2 more people working with us on the team on various things (social media/engagement/etc). This is one of our top priorities right now - so if this is something you can see yourself doing - please reach out to me, even if the amount of time you can commit is small!

Also, as I have stated earlier - we are proud of the fact that all of the funds thus donated to us have been entirely dedicated to the buying and reimbursing of food/goods for the homeless (and I intend to keep it that way). One repeated suggestion that I have had was to pay our employees for their time, even minimal. Because of our pledge to not use the funds for that purpose at the start, we had to come up with a different solution which is as follows:

[https://www.flowcode.com/page/lmcfthl](https://www.flowcode.com/page/lmcfthl) \- these are wallets we set up for the sole purpose of optional support to provide our employees (again this is just to have the option there - we absolutely do not require anything to continue to operate, but if you want to support the employees that have been working completely free since the start this is the way to do it).

That about sums it up for now - I hope we met/exceeded the expectations of those of you who have followed us from the beginning - if not, we will try even harder going forward. Feel free to post any and all criticism/suggestions/support/anything and we will take it all in!","self","https://redd.it/vbln06"

Is it still somewhat traceable since lets say you send a transaction of something like $12.37 to an mweb address, and then like 5 minutes later a transaction of the same $12.37 is sent from a randomized mweb address to a regular ltc address, couldn't someone inspecting the blockchain easily tie the input and output amounts if they're about the same amount?

&#x200B;

Lets say on Litecoin Core you 4 wallets:

1st wallet is all non-mweb LTC you receive from an exchange, lets say $10 which i then send to wallet 2 through mweb and non-mweb addresses

2nd wallet is a mix of mweb and non-mweb addresses you received from wallet 1 ($3 on non-mweb and $7 on mweb) which i then send all to wallet 3

3rd wallet is ONLY all mweb which i then send to wallet 4 (is the $7 mweb to mweb amount completely anonymous on the blockchain?)

4th wallet is non-mweb ... will the input/output amounts on wallet 4 show a single $10 from wallet 3 on the blockchain from the same mweb address?

&#x200B;

They are fast, borderless, with low gas fees!

I think top charities like: 

* ​​[CARE](https://www.care.org/) 
* [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/) 
* [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org/)
* [Founders Pledge](https://founderspledge.com/) 
* [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/) 

Should accept donations in LTC.

No banks No Cash No third party just a way to lock 🔒 up your LTC until you the seller confirms receiving the cash. The buyer only then gets instant access to his new LTC and must send it to his personnel wallet.  May not be kept on the exchange as the exchange wallet and its address’s are deleted once the transaction is confirmed or cancelled. 

The Node only holds the LTC in a separate wallet and does not release it until the transaction is satisfied or cancelled.   Neither the buyer or the seller holds the seeds to this wallet. Only a address to validate the LTC is real and a way to identify themselves to the exchange who knows them only as a address to a wallet on the server. No identity checks required no passwords.  Their public keys 🔑 to the transaction wallet are all that is required. The buyer and seller do not know each other’s address only the server knows them both. Both are required to send the LTC to the buyer or return it to the seller.  


No cash, No identity exchange,  the buyer cash apps the seller directly and once paid confirms the transaction and the LTC is unlocked.  No identity required. His identity is his address to the LTC transaction wallet. 

I think this idea has merit with all the exchanges going tits up stealing millions of crypto.

However, today I noticed that ALL of my LTC is gone from the Wallet when viewing on the ShapeShift platform.

The transaction history shows the dates when I transferred to my Wallet, however it’s now showing my transfer of LTC as a sum of 0/$0. And the coin as N/A.

There’s been no withdrawal from my Wallet, so I’m not concerned it was stolen. It just seems LTC isn’t supported by the platform any longer, but I wasn’t informed of this, and not sure why they would drop support.

The keepkey sub doesn’t seem to have any activity lately so I figured I’d have my best luck on here. Does anybody in this sub use keepkey as their hardware Wallet that can offer some input? I messaged keepkey also, just waiting on reply.

you can also clone it at [https://github.com/qprimed/RTL.git](https://github.com/qprimed/RTL.git) and then switch to the ""Release-0.12.3-qp"" branch on your local repo and install.

I have tested it with my own nodes and it works as expected.

For background... In RTL release 0.10.2 the RTL devs decided to put on their toxic Bitcoin maximalist ass-hats and add a specific check of the LND backend on init.  If the underlying chain was anything other than ""bitcoin"", RTL would throw up a mocking message and basically tell you to screw off -  all of this with no prior warning to users who might find themselves locked out of their LN funds.  Needless to say, LTC is fully supported on Lightning and this just seemed capricious to the point of malice by the RTL devs.  RTL and LND-Admin are two reasonable  LN management consoles and it was a pity to lose one of them.  Hopefully this recent, unfuqd fork will ease some of the pain.

This is due to the fact that many creatives are starting to embrace blockchain technology as a means of bringing their art in front of the eyes of many collectors, and as such, this has proven to be a solid revenue stream for them. 

Litecoin is one of the oldest, as well as one of the most well-known blockchain networks currently available, which has stood the test of time and is regularly available to develop on. If you are a creative that aims to develop their NFTs on top of the Litecoin blockchain network, today, we are going to go over just about everything you need to know about completing this task. Let’s dive in.

**Key Points:**

* Litecoin is a secure network that makes privacy a much more straightforward process and has low fees, which is one of the main reasons why it might be the preferred option to mint NFTs. This means that you can create a Litecoin NFT.
* The Litecoin network is also utilized as a payment method, which means that many cryptocurrency payment processors accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment, which opens up a lot more gateways for creatives to capitalize on their art through it.
* LTC is the native cryptocurrency token of the network, and it is a cryptocurrency that can be mined due to the fact that the network utilizes the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism.
* Anyone can easily connect to a Litecoin (LTC) node through the utilization of NOWNodes, after which they will be fully able to get any blockchain data that they require.

About 1 more year till next halvening!

I have been constantly accumulating and spending LTC as much as possible. (Spending decentralized the network by increasing holders).

Once the supply to demand ratio drops (or halven), I believe this coin will have a surge of demand due to miners not willing to sell at a loss on electricity. Currently the mining rewards are bad. Break even for the L7 antminer is difficult/ impossible with power costs of $.11 kwh.

Btc is at 91% mined and LTC is still 84%

When btc was 84% mined it was in 2019! If this continues how it is going now I believe the next demand increase for LTC will happen once 90 to 95% of LTC has already been mined. 98% of btc will be mined by 2030, 96% of ltc will be mined by 2030. LTC's supply block reward will slowly become closer and closer to BTCs as time goes on.

Will LTC's stock to flow model correct itself?

In the bull market in 2021, many people will join the crypto market for the long or short, and many people are also entering the mining field, such as me.

But it is difficult for me to explain to others what mining is. First of all, it requires a machine and then plugs in the power supply, connects to the mining pool, and obtains a small amount of income every day.

Currently, I am mining LTC and DOGE at f2pool. This is merged mining. When I mine LTC, f2pool will also give me some DOGE.

My Litecoin transaction was never credited to my account after hundreds of confirmations already.

I don't get a message saying the wallet is empty, I simply get a message saying the words are wrong. I had checked balances before, so I know they're correct. About a year ago I sent a support request to Litecoin but never heard a reply.

Any suggestions

EDIT: OK, why I never thought of this before I'll never understand! Let this be a lesson to the rest of you.

DO NOT capitalize any of the letters in your seed phrase. I wrote mine down, after each word I made a hard return, and so the next line began with a capital letter. So each time I tried to re-enter the phrase I copied directly from my typed words. That meant in each of the three locations I checked, they all confirmed one another in that they had a Capital Letter At The Beginning Of Each Word.

Copy exactly as given to you in your wallet - don't capitalize anything!

My wallet is recovered and the LTC is there.

In the process, the department highlighted a few things: The U.S. federal government is dead set on ensuring that U.S. citizens are completely surveilled and subjugated; altcoin projects aren't as decentralized as advertised; and while Bitcoin is significantly more immune to these types of attacks compared to the altcoin projects out, there complacency isn't an option. There are many things that can be done to ensure the network is as robust as possible against efforts by the state to curb bitcoin adoption and usage.  
>  
>By adding Tornado Cash to the sanctions list, the Treasury Department highlighted many shortcomings of the Ethereum ecosystem which claims to be decentralized. Almost immediately services like Alchemy and Infura — centralized API and node infrastructure companies leveraged by many companies and individuals “using” Ethereum — cut off their users from accessing the Tornado Cash contract.

MWEB increases the privacy of LTC, will this be better out of policy regulation? I know that the major update of LTC some time ago has enhanced privacy, does this help to resist regulation? At least these altcoins are not based on the contract mechanism of ETH ecology. So it may be more difficult to sanction, but for some trading platforms that require KYC, it seems to have little effect.

There was never a problem before but this time it is not confirmed yet. It's about 4 or 5 weeks ago and the transaction is still pending? I am not sure what to do. It's only testnet but I want to fix it anyways to learn how to deal with that.  


  


Some more details:

While digital gold is struggling to keep soaring, digital silver, Litecoin (LTC), has managed to withstand the volatility yet again. Current [Litecoin Price Prediction](https://blog.coindcx.com/price-predictions/ltc-price-2022-2023-2024-2025/) estimate that the price will soar in the future. So, understanding the token’s history and benefits becomes essential.

**History**

Even before the 2022 crypto market crash, Litecoin braved various other odds after its inception. Despite failing to half like BTC, the token captured the confidence of the market to rise to $255.79 in 2021. However, currently, the token stands at an 80% lower rate.

Nonetheless, the resiliency of crypto is intact and will prove fruitful in the future.

**Operational Benefits**

On top of being a jumping-off point for other currencies, the basic abilities of Litecoin are more compared to its competitors. The transactions using crypto are four times more quickly processed at a cheaper service fee than BTC. The token is also more secure and transparent with its features of protection from viruses and trojan horses.

**Higher Hard-Cap**

With 84 million LTC, the supply of Litecoin is significantly more than Bitcoin, making the token one of the most in-demand crypto. To top it off, the block creation with the token is of two and a half minutes duration, while BTC takes ten minutes. Besides, the network outreach of the LTC community across all social media platforms has also made it an excellent 'moat.'

**Technologically Advanced**

Despite being a fork crypto of BTC, Litecoin has incorporated tremendous technological changes in its code. With the Scrypt hash function, it is more adaptable to be used as a day-to-day currency. Instead of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICS), the token employs more memory usage to make the network more accessible.

Considering all these aspects, Litecoin seems like a decent investment opportunity even during the bear market. However, it'd be best to err on caution by placing it in a portfolio with a long-term strategy.","self","https://redd.it/wqiy8m"

Litecoin mining generated a 39% profit for miners and outperformed other PoW cryptocurrencies.

LTC witnessed significant growth in  popularity on social fronts. Over the past month, Litecoin’s social  mentions grew by 9.4% and its social engagements increased by 22.8%. 

The Hashrate continues to grow!! A growing hashrate for any proof of work (PoW) network indicates strength and security for the blockchain. Hitting over 500  TH/s

Trustless onchain DEX has always been the holy grail to achieve true censorship resistance plus coin's own fungibility feature.

The idea was demonstrated first back in 2017 with Charlie Lee also involved ([https://twitter.com/satoshilite/status/910534107058233344](https://twitter.com/satoshilite/status/910534107058233344))

After few years' development funded by Decred's treasury, the software/dex has been used extensively within the Decred's community. Now Litecoin has been integrated. 

I believe ERC20 based stable coins pairs will be added soon as well.","self","https://redd.it/xsauxd"

1) MWEB transactions are low frequency (but growing - increased tx frequency is important!)

2) There are occasional high value movements in and out of MWEB - awesome, confidence in MWEB is building!

and a few comments...

1) Use Tor whenever possible to help break potential associations between your node's IP address and your transactions - this, IMHO, is the number 1 safety precaution for already seasoned Litecoin users to help maintain privacy while using MWEB.

2) Once your coins are in MWEB, move them around a bit.  Send them to yourself using another MWEB address (or an entirely separate MWEB enabled wallet).  Generate additional, small MWEB to MWEB traffic to help yourself and everyone else using MWEB.  LTC transaction fees are insanely low, so take advantage of it to help strengthen MWEB and the network as a whole while MWEB boostraps.  Miners will also appreciate even a minuscule bump in tx fee revenue.

3) Trickle your coins in and out of MWEB - right now, large value pegin/pegout transactions stand out - its likely much better to generate many small transactions to more effectively obfuscate interactions between the main chain and MWEB through the pegin/pegout process.

4) Stay on MWEB as much as possible.  USE IT... FOR EVERYTHING (if you can).  User experience and adoption will improve considerably when mobile wallet MWEB support finally drops but, in the meantime, offer the option of an MWEB address to receive payments at every opportunity.  **We must normalize the use of MWEB**.  I am hoping that 12 months from now the majority of day to day cash-like payments will essentially mean MWEB to MWEB transactions in everyone's minds - lets see if we can get there.

MWEB is amazing tech that helps to set Litecoin apart from every other major coin (near universal LTC acceptance, ultra high liquidity, MWEB fungibility, MWEB privacy, etc, etc, etc).  Lets do smart things with MWEB that protect ourselves and everyone else as we grow it.

So I was thinking in order to make accepting crypto easier for businesses wouldn't something like a litecoin wallet address DNS be an idea? Businesses could register a payment address they would usually give out to the general public, the top notch litecoin Devs could implement a type of DNS so a business say ""Microsoft"" could register a short easy name like Microsoft for a payment address.

This way when general wallies like me attempt to make a payment we don't need to check we're sending it to the correct address of random characters, it would be up to the business to ensure they have registered the correct address for DNS. I would only need to send it to Microsoft.

If you are a Web 3 developer who doesn't want to waste time and money on the maintenance of your own node but is looking for an easy and secured access to the Litecoin blockchain for the development needs, this information will be valuable for you.

You can easily access the Litecoin full node and get all transactions' data from the blockchain just using an API key.

We have prepared a short guide on how access the Litecoin full node via a NOWNodes API key.

So I was thinking as mining is obviously smashing energy and generating loads of heat why don't we use that heat to desalinate water in hot countries? or any country for that matter.

As places like Africa has super cheap electricity and no clean water, would it not be a good idea to mine in these areas and then set up a desalination plant, the heat from the mining farm and environment could be used to desalinate sea water, new water could be pumped in to keep the rigs at a reasonable temperature?

Hey guys. I'm here proudly launching [Trocador.app](https://Trocador.app) 's API System as promised.

Affiliate login: [https://trocador.app/en/affiliate/](https://trocador.app/en/affiliate/)  
API Docs: [https://trocador.app/en/docs/](https://trocador.app/en/docs/) (login needed)

Now anyone can create an account and receive an API Key and monetize websites, as well as mobile apps, personal projects such as trading algorithms, etc. The API was tested and is working well over both clearnet and TOR (for better privacy), so any kind of project can be monetized. With this system, you can get quotes and create transactions on any of our listed exchanges, always getting the best rate at that moment, and you don't pay extra for this: our rates are the same you would find on each individual exchange.

If you are not into programming, but have a website, you can also monetize it by copying and pasting the widget HTML tag inside your project. We have also tested the widget on [Moneroj.net](https://moneroj.net/), which can be seen on the main page there. It's Javascript-free.

***Next Steps)***

Looking back these last weeks since the launch, we had hundreds of successful trades with no reported issues whatsoever, so I'll assume we have served well our clients. Litecoin is certainly one of the most used coins on our website. The KYC rating feature, which we added last week, is very useful to warn users about each exchange's policy so they can take the best decision possible before each trade. As for the future, we look forward to:

* create partnerships with other projects, wallets and websites;
* list new exchanges (to provide better rates);
* list more coins;

I'm a long-time lurker of this sub and reading almost every single post reaching my home page. The topics of the posts differ a bit but at the end it always comes to Litecoin being an awesome cryptocurrency with larger blocksize and cheaper fees - the list continues.  
What would you say are some real advantages of Litecoin compared to Bitcoin?  
If so, why are you bullish on Litecoin? Do you also hold Bitcoin?

Don't get me wrong I also hold a small stack but for me it seems it is just a fork with a smaller community.

Litecoin was partly designed to be ASIC resistant but now it's not. I feel like we should fork or something (If possible) to another algorithm to be ASIC resistant. It seems like Litecoin will be just as clunky as Bitcoin before long if it gathers enough steam, and mining will be so specialized the normal folk will be unable to join. Surely we would be better with CPU only mining (I don't know the technicals). This way literally everyone could be involved and its unlikely it would ever become centralized?   
Or do you think we are on the right track and ASIC mining is the way to go? I like the idea one day Litecoin would be a main currency (Maybe I'm dreaming) and I know we have side chains to assist with scalability but they always feel half adopted and a bit mystical, maybe they need time.

Tommy from [AllArk](https://allark.io) here.

We support 4 major cryptocurrencies and Litecoin is one of them. We’ve seen some adoption via LTC for off ramps via PayPal, Zelle and SEPA.

Just curious what other off-ramps would the community like to see or would like to use.

Again, this is to off-ramp from LTC to fiat.

Crypto is now full of shady exchange tokens, stablecoins, shitcoin projects, foundations that gift themselves the majority of the supply... even in the case of Bitcoin Satoshi holds a disproportionate amount. 

I've always known that the fairness of Litecoin has been relatively unparalleled and always completely understood exactly what Charlie was doing by selling his coins and removing even himself as a longterm central point of contention.

Admittedly I've never been the greatest fan of the silver to Bitcoins gold analogy and I'm not sure how well it stood the test of time. However I have always liked the respect for Bitcoin in fact I've always seen litecoin as respectful to the sector in general. 

That's when it clicked, for me the greatest attribute litecoin from its initial distribution to today... is that it is fair. I also believe that's an attribute that's going to be increasingly more valued as time goes on.

The problem is that people who seek to make money ALWAYS arise in a moment of uncertainty and or of tragedy and they're ALWAYS seeking to make money off others. You see this with donations to cancer treatment, domestic and foreign attacks, and even the littlest guy begging on the street corner with a spongebob paper skin and glass bones story that then goes home in a rolls royce. 
The most successful in deception will never let you know that you've been played like a fool until you can  no longer do anything about it. 

So let's come to a consensus. 
What Wallet should people use to store said ltc off of exchanges? Give your pros and cons. State or let others give reasons why one wallet is better than another. We want a spotlight here so we can filter out who's giving a reputable recommendation and who's a scam artist hoping to stay in the shadows. 

We're all in this together. Dont forget that not everyone knows how to set a wallet up or how they can quickly sell their coins if they need or want to down the line.

Litecoin is clearly setup to become the 2nd most valuable coin after Bitcoin, this is almost inevitable, might take a year or two but this is inevitable. I’ll explain below. But first: 

What is the current situation with atomic swap liquidity between LTC and BTC?

Now why inevitable: 

Litecoin has Segwit/LN, atomic swappable with BTC, has Mimblewimble, has Taproot. Can do 56 tps on chain, has no premine, excellent mining decentralization. With all above features becomes the ultimate transactional privacy coin.

I’d like to study the liquidity on BTC atomic swaps currently being provided. Anyone who knows what is happening please comments.

Regulation is incoming, since there has now been an event that reached enough of a scale to provide political cover for stepping into the crypto market.  The number of cryptocurrencies that are clearly securities masquerading as something new is staggering, way over 90%.  Honestly I can count the number of cryptos I have confidence that aren't some sort of outright scam or, at best, an unregistered security on one hand, and Litecoin is one of them.

Bitcoin will continue to lead, and a lot of the fighting as the market clears and develops will involve larger and larger institutions, and governments.  This fighting will not always be clean, and will create a lot of volatility, but huge upward price pressure over time.  Litecoin, being so undervalued in comparison, has an opportunity to quietly tag along on this action, with less exposure to the struggle that is certain to erupt.

I don't know what the timeline will be, but I fully expect Bitcoin to outperform and displace fiat as debt and inflation spiral.  Eventually this Bitcoin is likely to be the pristine store of value that backs core money supply, with strong incentives to hoarding.  There will be a handful of cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, plus (what Bitcoin isn't being hoarded on) Lightning acting as the broad money supply to facilitate daily commerce and economic activity.  If this is the outcome, Bitcoin will be in the 10s of millions USD (in current purchasing power) with Litecoin in the hundreds of thousands.  But before then, the unit of account would have moved on from thinking of things in dollar terms.","self","https://redd.it/z23r7z"

It's difficult to say definitively whether Litecoin is better than Bitcoin, as this is a subjective question and the answer will depend on individual preferences and priorities. Both Bitcoin and Litecoin are decentralized cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology to enable secure and fast peer-to-peer transactions. However, there are some differences between the two that may make one more appealing than the other to some users.

One key difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin is the speed of transactions. Litecoin is designed to generate blocks and confirm transactions more quickly than Bitcoin, which means that Litecoin transactions are typically faster and can be processed more efficiently. This can make Litecoin more appealing to users who value speed and efficiency in their transactions.

Another difference between the two cryptocurrencies is the mining process. Litecoin uses a different mining algorithm than Bitcoin, which is designed to be more efficient and require less computing power. This can make Litecoin more accessible to individual miners and can help to decentralize the network.

Ultimately, whether Litecoin is better than Bitcoin will depend on individual preferences and priorities. Some users may prefer the faster transaction speeds and more accessible mining process of Litecoin, while others may prefer the more established and well-known Bitcoin network.","self","https://redd.it/zge32q"

Hey everyone!

I just wanted to share a thought with y'all about how we can all play a part in driving up the value of the crypto ecosystem. You know what they say, ""a rising tide lifts all boats.""

One way we can do this is by supporting businesses that accept crypto as a form of payment. By doing so, we're not only supporting these businesses, but we're also helping to increase the overall adoption and use of crypto.

Think about it - if more and more businesses start accepting crypto, it becomes a more viable and useful currency. And as the use of crypto increases, so too does its value.

So next time you're out shopping or looking to support a small business, keep an eye out for those that accept crypto. And if you own a business, consider adding crypto as a payment option. It's a win-win for everyone!

Let's keep building and promoting this amazing ecosystem together.

Stay crypto strong!","self","https://redd.it/zpwsoy"

“Litecoin bills itself as the silver to bitcoin’s gold, and they’ve always been about payments and making it a great solution for conducting payments.”

– Stephen Pair, CEO of BitPay said.

The crypto processing platform unveiled its support for litecoin in July 2021. Since then, BitPay has handled more than 200,000 litecoin transactions with a total worth of more than $35 million.

Pair said BitPay users use litecoin for everyday purchases and repeatable transactions of several hundred dollars, while bitcoin is more popular for larger purchases.

making headlines over the last few days with reports of a possible nationwide ban on cryptocurrency and crypto mining These reports come as a result of the Director of Financial Stability Elizaveta Danilovas call to ban crypto The central bank has since released a 37page report outlining the reasoning behind this proposal Politics are local laws are national and currencyvalue is international and therein lies the inherent problem with the outlined proposal The Report in a Nutshell A key criticism within the report was the market volatility of cryptocurrencies highlighted on page 23 However in this context the central bank fails to address activities such as gambling or stocks with the same level of scrutiny This is the common underlying theme throughout the document along with several other key points with similar shortcomings The report paints crypto as one of the main destabilizing threats to the Russian economy while loosely aided by the idea that people would invest all of their hardearned money into Bitcoin a highrisk asset While the report goes into further detail no projections or supporting documents were provided to validate such claims The report goes on to mention that Bitcoin and crypto transactions in general are often used for illicit activities on page 27 However the reality is that any form of monetary transaction can be used for such purposes In fact it was recorded that in 2021 only 015 of crypto transactions were used for illicit purposes This contradicts the claim that crypto undermines monetary policy not to mention that it doesnt align with Russias civil code which recognizes crypto mining as a form of entrepreneurship Additionally the report raised concerns associated with crypto minings high energy consumption and its negative effect on the environment This point is heavily used throughout the report as a backbone for reinforcing its stance on the crypto ban while entirely ignoring the possibilities of exploring green and renewable energy solutions that could be researched and funded by Russias crypto mining industry The report also seemingly throws around various claims such as that 01 of all miners control over 50 of the Bitcoin mining industry in the country page 23 without citing any credible sources for such information and failing to acknowledge that some of the biggest miners in the country are publicly traded companies There are a plethora of other false statements as well including that stablecoins are not backed by anything and arent regulated page 24 when in reality stablecoins like Circle USDC are fully regulated and legally redeemable What is the goal of the ban The proposed ban has no intent to ban crypto outright We note that we do not suggest that holding cryptocurrencies by citizens be banned Danilova stated according to TASS Russias state media adding that there are fraud risks as well as difficulties in asserting rights when acquiring cryptocurrency on foreign crypto exchanges What the ban is targeting instead is to prohibit the issuance of tokens crypto mining trading activity that uses the countrys existing financial infrastructure and prohibiting institutional investors from investing in crypto Russia is currently the worlds third biggest crypto miner by hashrate just behind the US and Kazakhstan As mentioned earlier crypto mining is defined and officially recognized by its civil code and has immense potential for stimulating a significant economic growth for the nation should it be embraced Panic Amidst Misunderstanding To make matters worse a number of sources have contributed to the spinning of this story by saying that Russia is banning crypto including an article by Forbes that incorrectly states and spells that Russian is the third nation to crackdown on cryptocurrencies over the last year following China and Kazakhstan The Forbes commentary isnt true and while Kazakhstan did face nationwide power disruptions it in fact did not crack down on mining and crypto and as of today neither has Russia What does it boil down to While the report by the Russian Central Banks head of financial stability is 37 pages long it in itself is just a proposal based on ones fears and assumptions fueled by misinformation around issues that either do not exist or are not likely to happen For such reasons it is highly unlikely that the Russian government will take Elizaveta Danilovas proposal seriously as it simply lacks solutions and fails to outline any concrete next steps not to mention that it would put the country on a backward trajectory seeing as Russia has just legalized cryptocurrencies in 2020 If such a ban were to go forward it would reverse this legislation which took nearly 10 years to pass not to mention that it would take several years to implement Such a decision would be counterintuitive especially in light of recent calls by the US and its allies to disconnect Russia from SWIFT in the event of its invasion of Ukraine The hypothetical situation has received widespread media coverage and Russias exclusion from the international payment system would have catastrophic effects on its economy This would in turn push Russia into mass crypto adoption Should such events take place it is highly unlikely that Russia would want to transact in CBDC Chinas digital currency or the Yuan and would instead have to rely on Bitcoin to transact with the world It is likely that the Russian government understands that it would be far more beneficial to tax the mining industry rather than ban it Such taxation would present opportunities for infrastructure expansions and reinvestments into green and renewable energy sources Taxation could also come in the form of utility or the licensing of mining facilities to use a Russian sponsored mining pool that would implement a tax in real time further reinforcing the potential for significant economic growth It seems that such potential is not far from being actioned on by the Russian government with the Russian director for financial policy Ivan Chebeskov supporting the regulation of crypto as opposed to banning it Chebeskovs sentiment comes as a response to the central banks proposal further indicating the unlikelihood of an outright ban He further outlines We need to give these technologies the opportunity to develop In this regard the Ministry of Finance is actively involved in the development of legislative initiatives in terms of regulating this market According to Chebeskov the ministry has prepared its own proposal this one for the regulation of crypto and digital assets and is awaiting feedback from the government Industry Experts Weigh In The Bank of Russia conducts its activities independently from other federal bodies of state power regional authorities and local governments meaning they do not have a final say in local government activity and would have a hard time banning utility companies from providing power to mining operations Across the entire report crypto mining in particular is mentioned only a handful of times and within the context of energy consumption On page 4 of the report a brief summary of mining is provided and then swiftly dismissed as a threat to the economy In this regard according to the Bank of Russia the best solution is to introduce these prohibitions on the mining of cryptocurrencies No actionable solutions are provided and the statement is followed by a summary of the Bank of Russias plan to develop their own digital currency Roman Zabuga PR director of mining hosting provider BitRiver called the probability of an industrywide ban negligible A Widespread Misunderstanding While the call for a ban on crypto mining sounds daunting it is important to note that this is currently no more than a proposal on behalf of the Bank of Russia which would need to be approved by the government first Such decisions are usually time consuming and initial proposals are often adjusted through compromise or rejected altogether Recent events in the industry have showcased a general lack of understanding for cryptocurrencies and mining on behalf of government bodies and other institutional leaders as seen with Russias Central Bank A recent House hearing on energy in crypto mining is another example prompting Grant McCarty of Bitcoin Magazine to reiterate that Congress doesnt yet hate Bitcoin This hearing didnt signal malice on the part of Congress it signaled a lack of education These people just dont know enough about Bitcoin to have that strong of an opinion yet In Conclusion The Russian Central Banks proposed ban is unlikely to pass as it clearly demonstrates the need for a better understanding of crypto within government bodies in order to allow for the technological advancements and economic spurts that are made possible by this developing industry As a result the proposals lack of credible sources and solutions stems from general fear uncertainty and doubt The proposal has also prompted a swift response on behalf of Russias Ministry of Finance calling for proper regulation of crypto and digital assets not a ban President Putin has also briefly addressed this issue during a conference meeting on January 26 saying that Russia does in fact have a competitive advantage in crypto mining due to a surplus of electricity and the welltrained personnel available in the country further adding to the improbability of a ban on crypto Read Full Article Here,Neutral,0.5364804863929749

find it appropriate to go over a few key points that should be kept in mind of the reader This is the opinion of a user known as Knight and nothing more Anything discussed here is meant to facilitate a vision of what Litecoin offers to the masses as a global solution Litecoin it is a Decentralized fork of Bitcoin with benefits of speed security and scalability But why do we need it At first glance this is a good question and it took me a long time in crypto before i understood exactly what Litecoin is and what makes it a game changer In order to understand why any crypto is needed there should be some perspective on the current state of the world and its monetary system of centralized power Fiat Currency For as long as humans have been on Earth we have found ways to exchange goods and services through mediums of exchange We used stones sticks water land ect anything that was of value to the next person of which you needed something from As time evolved humans began to find more clever ways to do business and a more common medium Gold This was before any fiat currency was globally accepted as money Gold or Silver would be sent by land or water to the places it needed to go and this couldve taken a month or two depending on location if not longer Time passed and we evolved to paper money notes which was used as a more portable option and far less risky This paper backed money was only good because the banks had the gold to back it up and replace the paper if neededUntil 1971 when Nixon President of the United States at the time drove the worlds leading economy away from the gold standard and made it to where people could no longer take their paper and turn it into gold real money The Dark Ages Fast forward to the 2000s and you find a lot of the paper money that used to be backed by gold is not anymore and has been inflated to astronomical proportions In 1913 a 1 wouldve bought you 16 loaves of bread 006 per loaf and in 2013 the price of that same loaf isover 1 At the time of writing 2022 a loaf of bread is 274 The buying power of the dollar has fallen drastically from 1913 to 2013 you are talking about a 94 decline This is the cancer of inflation the root of financial woes and trouble and who is Economys doctor from this The Federal Reserve and Centralized banks Centralized Power How is it possible to just create more of something and deem it acceptable by everyone even though it devalues everyone elses portion without their consent Government The Federal Reserve the Fed is an independent entity to the Federal Government but The Federal Government hires the people in charge of the Fed And the Feds job is to regulate the financial structure of the economy managing the downturns and upswings Keep in mind that the Federal Reserve is made up of humans and they make errors like everyone else So in no way is this a proper system to manage the debts and credits of an entire global economy Your Bank Outside of the Fed regulations and how they inflate the dollar there is also the bank who thanks to the Fed and government can create magic money that really doesnt exist Example Say you have 100 and you put it in your bank That bank now has control over that money and although when you check day and night your 100 stays there But what you dont see is what they do with your money They loan it out to people and charge interest for them so your 100 gets loaned to charlie with a fee 97 Charlie then takes that and buys something with it the merchant then puts that 97 into a bankand yeah rinse and repeat Now your 100 has been turned into 33000 in the system then that cash is used in the stock market to bet against the very loans they just gave you No wonder it takes your bank days to process a transaction Bitcoin and Litecoin The problems above are the root of the cancer that eats away at society and takes it down a road of no return Bitcoin when it was created had a Libertarian vision of returning to the old method of trade which was peer to peer not needing an intermediary bank This vision has been at the core of All of crypto which is the financial freedom that each human seeks in their heart Litecoin as stated above is a fork an update in simpler terms of bitcoin and solves every major problem above Litecoin is a trusted network that runs by the community and for the community meaning there is no centralized authority on what should be done concerning it Updates happen as needed and voted on by those working on the open source code Litecoin also solves the problem of inflation because there will only ever be 84000000 LTC in existence and so the supply cannot be manipulated Litecoin because of its speed can get a transaction through at the speed of light and with little to no cost to the user When you receive your LTC in the wallet there is no one else who moves it around or manipulates it like a bank can do with fiat It is yours and no one can move it except you Litecoin also can be used as a payment through the wallet with the card feature so there is no need for a bank With Blockchain as a monetary policy for a nation it would eliminate the human potential for error and showcase that the Network knows best how to handle a global economy From an information perspective it already does look at google and how many people use it compared to an actual dictionary Blockchain is no different Humankind has been through cycle of cycle in a fiat spiral that regardless of how long you evade it has one destination and thats destruction The system has been broken beyond repair and nature has give us a solution Blockchain It is the next evolution of a peer to peer infrastructure that will replace a Centralized authority of both monetary policy and social dynamics Litecoin has already built the tech for the future and is only a couple of steps away from getting us to the vision that is Bitcoin and Litecoin As soon as the wallet is able to accept a direct deposit and have the funds be converted into photons then the banks will no longer be needed and adoption is all that is left,Neutral,0.5117247700691223

running crypto for the homeless We recently just had our 3 year anniversary 42819 start date a couple months ago this post is a little bit late For those of you who dont know crypto for the homeless CFTHL is a nonprofit organization I created with the intention of doing something unique with crypto while at the same time helping the needy I started it completely out of pocket at the start and was able to get the organization of its feet immediately due to the massive support shown from social media mainly reddit I never set out to solve homelessness as I think that is a systemic problem that even governments can not fix but rather to reintroduce a human aspect of charity that I felt was sorely missing from most other projects at least in my opinion We differentiated ourselves by utilizing all of the funds we received thus far on foodgoods for the homeless and also delivering food straight to the homelessneedy In addition to this we have photo documentation of all food hand outs as well as receipts dating back to the very first time we handed out food 3 full years of photos at this point which I believe no other charity has come close to doing While we had very humble beginnings we are proud to have 501c3 status for 2 years now and also recently launched our brand new website check it out We also have had a massive amount of volunteer support people buy and hand out food for us and get reimbursed in crypto Our partners in New Zealand have been doing the most amazing work consistently for us and I could not be prouder here is an album of some of their recent work In terms of donations we have received enough roughly 75000 thus far to last us probably a decade or more of work at our current rate if we ration the spending to maintain our current rate which I view as a massive success and also a guarantee of our longevity Ive learned a ton from running this project thus far and Ive used a lot of it to try and improve the project if possible 1 It is impossible to satisfy 100 of people with ANY project for this one in particular there are those who oppose helping homeless people in general and thus they will inherently hate this project no matter what I do 2 It is impossible to make this project 100 trustless despite what most people who have that criticism say It is ultimately a project based on human work and the best that Iwe can do is provide a massive amount of proof of work which we have that should be used as a basis of our legitimacy At this point having 3 years of photos as well as documenting over 20000 donations in monero should be more than enough proof of our legitimacy in addition to reimbursing 100 of our volunteers who participated properly 3 A lot of people want to steer the project in many different directions ultimately the projects design is a very personal thing when it comes down to it I personally created it with a very specific vision in mind and that may not align with what youor other people feel the best vision is That is perfectly fine and yo are free to create a project to carry out that vision in the same way I have carried out mine Projects like this cost timemoney and the very fact that enough supporters on the internet have funded this project to last us 10 years now at least shows that we have a reason to exist I am beyond grateful for this support and intend to respect the intentions of our donors for the extreme long term Which brings us to future plans We currently have a couple people including myself dedicating quite a lot of time each day working on the websitessocial mediacommunicating with volunteer prospectsetc There are actually a lot of things that occur behind the scenes that are very time consuming and we could use 1 or 2 more people working with us on the team on various things social mediaengagementetc This is one of our top priorities right now so if this is something you can see yourself doing please reach out to me even if the amount of time you can commit is small Also as I have stated earlier we are proud of the fact that all of the funds thus donated to us have been entirely dedicated to the buying and reimbursing of foodgoods for the homeless and I intend to keep it that way One repeated suggestion that I have had was to pay our employees for their time even minimal Because of our pledge to not use the funds for that purpose at the start we had to come up with a different solution which is as follows these are wallets we set up for the sole purpose of optional support to provide our employees again this is just to have the option there we absolutely do not require anything to continue to operate but if you want to support the employees that have been working completely free since the start this is the way to do it That about sums it up for now I hope we metexceeded the expectations of those of you who have followed us from the beginning if not we will try even harder going forward Feel free to post any and all criticismsuggestionssupportanything and we will take it all in,Bullish,0.5447016358375549

this sub and rMonero Im guessing this may get downvoted to hell for the same reason behind my decision in the title But its an analytical decision based on time resources and what I personally see as the drivers of momentum and excitement behind projects Also admittedly a personal moral decision Reddit users surely arent the majority of Monero users And this subs users alone certainly arent And especially not the most vocal ones However the most vocal ones matter they help attract similarminded new users help shape public perception of Monero and do seem to me to over the years to increasingly reflect a growing sentiment and demographic of zealous Monero supporter An apparently very young often prepostpubescent male shockingly naive extremeLibertarian brash altrightincelish plagued with absolutist blackandwhite thinking and when enough info is provided to tell often seem to be generally authoritarianleaningJan 6supporting types And yes overwhelmingly American though if more so than the some 98 of Reddit users who knows Those types again not lumping even most Monero users here seem to embody a youre either with us or with the terrorists type of mentality unable to hold and consider as valid multiple competing ideas To them Monero is the only privacyfocused or even privacyadjacent cryptocurrency period and anyone who disagrees must are Sheeple It takes fandom and bizarre levels brand loyalty to an whole new extreme place I have an everdecreasing appetite to be associated in any way with that or to support people like that however indirectly Ie providing my and my CPUs time and notinsignificant resources mining and operating a public node And while it may be a minority of Monero users the fact that Monero seems to attract those types disproportionately compared to other projects is what matters more so than some indeterminate absolute And sure this is unscientific Im only going on the general vibes Im getting from the landscape among the myriad reddit crypto subs Ethereum subs can be pretty obnoxious too but usually not with the creepy Ayn Randinsurrectionistincel undertones Ive mined monero at a loss and run a public node since 2017 Ive also DCAd and hodld into a cold wallet over that time as well as actively traded on a different exchange Im a huge fan of the goals of Monero And am grateful for the efforts of the devs and community But when I get home from vacation Im shutting it all down and divesting Divesting in a down market is easy you can always make that work in your favor as long as your target isnt your national currency of choice eg USD or stablecoin Ill move my XMR to something else that I believe has longterm potential but has been pounded even harder as a percentage Then when the time is right in the future when that is pumping and my next privacyfocused projects are lower in comparison Ill move into thatthose I cant move XMR SCRT now for example as SCRT has been holding up pretty well Look Monero is great But its just a privacyfocused cryptocurrency Nothing more nothing less Its the first and currently still arguably the best sure It was brilliantly designed and had a lot of work put into it And arguably being the biggest is undoubtedly the most decentralized and secure But thats a function of time not necessarily design There are now a halfdozen privacyfocused if not privacyfirst coins At least one a practical ripoff of Monero currently They are new with all the attendant problems that go with that but you know what solves that Time ETH was once new compared to BTC too and too centralized and insecure etc In fact its insecurity was why we have ETC in the first place which is actually the original ETH blockchain ETH is the fork But no one cares about that now due to time Now that the hard work on Monero is mostly done besides ongoing fixes and improvements and the opensource designs and code are available of course part of the general opensource vision is for other projects to take the ideas and code and expand on them in new and innovative ways that the original project cant or is very hard to for myriad reasons And thats exactly what these projects have done all live except Zano Oxen Secret Dero Zano ZCash with optional privacy enabled As Ive mentioned before Secret in particular is attractive to me as it makes it very easy to get in and out of even with a lack of exchanges it supports private smart contracts and privacywrapped ETH BTC etc Dero is cool but so far seems like a Monero clone but with big future plans Time will tell if they deliver If not then why bother But what I like about them so far is the people investing in them by and large are just investors not zealous fanboys They have more practical goals than seeing an Ayn Rand Libertarian utopia wash over the land I sincerely wish the hopefully vast majority of nonQcult Monero holders the best of luck If Monero goes through the roof and my next privacy coin investment tanks Ill sleep just fine at night Some things are more important than investment returns And since no one can predict the future in speculative markets I dont lose sleep on any missed opportunities anyway Thanks for listening Update I havent personally been harassed nor a victim of specific toxicity perse Attempted to probably but hey this is the internet What else is new What Im referring to is mostly what Ive

Hello everyone I come today with something thats really worth paying attention to and studying I mean it If youre a trader set some time aside to review this because you wont see this anywhere else and its high signalnoise Remember last year when I kept hammering on the regression analysis and how that helped me nail the top to the day Well Ive done the same analysis this time to try and identify the bottom Now this is a long post so if you dont read all of I get it But at least review the next two sections and the chart What is a regression analysis anyways And why should I care The idea is to find a best fit equation that models a dependent variable like Price against one or more independent variables like Time Its one of those fundamental data science tools you would use to study any process In this instance we want to extrapolate into the future so that we can make data based predictions on when to buysell at least in a macro sense This isnt the only statistical tool available for price analysis but I would dare say its one of the most fundamentally important ones This is Data Science 101 and when used correctly can be very powerful Just to be clear this isnt arbitrary isnt made up on the fly it isnt subjectively based on some interpretation of hand drawn lines patterns Its fundamentally MORE important and to be weighted higher than any interpretation of moving averages RSI bollinger bands or other TA signals Thats not to say its perfect or will definitely hold All models are wrong some are useful But it does give us the best mostly objective picture that can be gleaned by adhering to the principles and methodologies of one of the most important and fundamental data science tools that we have rather than the mostly subjective interpretations of TA Im fairly confident that these solutions for the upper and lower bounds of Bitcoin price can be considered canonical meaning Ive correctly applied the methodology of regression analysis If you read nothing else this is the distilled version of this chartanalysis Blue Line Is the regression for the blowoff tops This is basically the same equation that I showed yall last year It uses the USD tops from 2010 2011 2013 and 2017 circled in blue Consider this to be the absolute highest possible price for Bitcoin at any point in the future Please note that I havent update the analysis to include Apr 14 2021 I want to illustrate how well this called the top last year without even including the Apr 2021 data Red Line This can be thought of in two ways One as the secondary capitulation during a bear market But you could also consider it to be the absolute lowest possible price for Bitcoin at any point into the future Orange Line This models only the first capitulation lows Remember its variable over time so the further we move into the future the higher the first capitulation low will be You can see that Ive also provided the color coded equations and sample dates for future extrapolations Each of these lines is for the start of a quarteryear Jan Apr July Oct Now remember that these models dont give us a specific date for when we should expect to touch the lower line All it does is give us an idea of what the lowest possible price might be depending on which future date were looking at Going deeper into understanding this model The reason we have two lines on the bottom is simple Bitcoin typically exhibts two capitulations during a bear market You can clearly see that if we only model the first capitulation orange that price still drops below the model Since the goal is to also provide a full lower bound equation beyond which price has never fallen we actually have to run an iterative process It looks like this Model a best fit equation for all price data Then toss out anything above it leaving only the lower portion Create another best fit equation and again remove the data points above it A few iterations of this and it quickly becomes apparent which points diverge the most You can then filter everything but the lowest most divergent points for each bear market and run the regression that produces the red line on the bottom If this doesnt fully make sense to you think of it this way Time is a factor Hypothetically if BTC sat at 30k for the next decade it technically wouldnt be a lower low in terms of USD But because it happened so far in the future it would intuitively feel like a divergence from the exponential price history Thats really what the red line represents The largest divergences from the overall exponential price curve Luckily even the worst divergences are still best modeled with their own exponentially rising curve And thats why models like this are powerful They capture an intuitive concept and yield a solid objectively derived model that you can use for making informed decisions on when to sell the top and when to buy the bottom Even if this model isnt 100 accuate its not lol its VERY likely to get us in the ballpark But didnt people like Plan B and the Rainbow Log Regression already do this Yes and no If you really want to understand why this is a unique analysis reasonably correct canonical and theirs are not it requires a bit more depth Nerd territory alert First and foremost lets understand the limitations and risks of what were trying to do here Extrapolation is always difficult and prone to error Even the best analysis will have some divergence if for no other reason than the inevitability of noise But moreover were attempting to model exponential data So any small procedural or methodological errors will quickly compound over time producing signficantly divergent results to the point of diminishing usefulness Mathematicians and data scientists of the past century have developed a fairly well defined set of mathematics and methodology to check your work and ensure that youre in fact producing the best modeling equation that statistics could dictate while also understanding the limitations and error range of the model Here are some of those things Checking pvalues to ensure your equation is statistically signficant Examining residuals plots to ensure your model is sufficiently complex to model all of the available signal Comparing adjusted rsquared between models to ensure that your equation is not overly complex and not just modeling random noise Running anova between models to determine if there is statistically significant improvement and not just due to chance Understanding your dataset identifying badnoisy data outliers and knowing when its appropriate to exclude data Understanding how to apply these concepts to answer specific questions and aspects about a dataset So whats the difference between what youre looking at here and guys like Plan B the Rainbow Regression or even Benjamin Cowen Its clear that they didnt properly analyze their residuals plots or else they wouldve seen the drift in their models And residuals plots are probably one of the most fundamental checks you need to do to make sure you have a valid model Which tells me that they probably didnt run any of the other statistical checks and probably are misapplying these tools in other ways Now I like Ben and hes gotten the closest of anyone Ive seen so far Hes not arrogant and takes a humble simple approach If anyone knows him personally and feel like pointing him my way feel free to do so He will continue updating his model with new data and it will have some level of usefulness but until he improves the model itself there is going to be a propensity for error at the edges and the further you try to extrapolate Contrast him with a guy like Plan B who is kind of arrogant Hell continue to issue ad hoc adjustments and posthoc justifications aka black swans and unforseen events to try and externalize the blame for why his provably bad model continues diverging rather than going back to the drawing board and really diving deep into proper regression analysis One Last Verification Piece of This Model One extra step that I took was to examine only the data from 2016 and before and apply the same methdology to see how well this would have worked for the last bullbear cycle in 17 and 18 In other words pretending that we were back in time say Jan 1 2017 I wanted to see how accurate this same methodology would have been back then It was accurate to within about 7 for both the top and the bottom Im sure I dont have to explain that on a process which rose 10000 from 2015 low to 2017 high and then dropped by 6x from the high to the 2018 capitulation this was phenomenally accurate Nothing else Ive seen anywhere comes remotely as close as this And again this same methodology was what I used when calling the Apr 14th top last year and it was off by less than 1 Okay thats all folks If anyone wants to do a deeper dive on my methodology hit me up We can do a call screenshare and I can share my rstudio scripts and include as many Monero peeps as want to join I know theres at least a couple statistics nerds out there who can validate my work,Positive,0.9994

a new one a macro metric that I include in my daily checks now which Ill explain later But first a word about some of the popular glassnodeish type analytics Stuff like onchain metrics miner profitability ribbons Mayer Multiple etc Those of you who track them have probably already noticed that most have broken down This isnt a temporary fluke While its easy to say in hindsight these really couldnt have been expected to hold up Primarily because the macro conditions are so different than other bear markets Markets are undergoing a significant monetary contraction phase in combination with high consumer inflation This immediately in the aftermath of unprecedented monetary expansion Not only are interest rates higher than at any time in BTC history they are rising faster as well Another reason is that quite alot of these are somewhat arbitrary redundant Rube Goldberg devices andor laggingdownstream of more fundamental indications Which is why I try to apply simplefundamental statistical concepts like moving averages moving standard deviations zscores and regression analysis After that I seek to understand the large picture funds flows how separate assets relate to each other and how the macro economic charts interrelate with those This essentially gives you the best chance at piecing together whats actually happening and what to expect DXY Lifetime DXY Local bull market DXY has finally gotten inside of the statistical range that Ive been waiting for as a potential top You can see the last time that we were above the lifetime standard deviation was the dotcom bust While DXY still has momentum and likely hasnt made its final high its close It could take 39 months of playing around in this range before longer term reversal happens but in absolute price terms we should be nearing the top DXY is primarily composed of the dollar vs EUR 58 JPY GBP CAD and a couple others Its a nice 30k ft view of risk appetite in the markets between countries with investors with big money During recessions king dollar has historically been the safety play that investors flee to whether from riskon assets like stocks or merely from other fiat currencies This recession has been no different with the dollar dominating the other fiat currencies Reverse Repo Agreements This is the new one that Ive started including Yaxis is in billions of dollars so currently 24T A reverse repo is basically when a large financial institution deposits cash overnight with the Fed in exchange for a very small interest rate At 24 trillion dollars this is significant So how to interpret this I believe this is cash that institutions dont want to deploy into any part of the markets for now but want to still have quick liquid access to redeploy when it makes more sense So this money represents latent economic energy maybe even a compressing spring But at least for now it keeps rising Institutions are still netwithdrawing from nearly all markets stocks bonds real estate Even commodities have come down The only thing showing big strength right now is the dollar Money Supply M2SL and Federal Reserve Balance Sheet M2SL is the sum of all cash coin checking savings and time deposits of less than 1 year Basically all of the liquid currency US currency in the system This is what you would normally think of as bank money The Federal reserve balance sheet is a bit more complex in the functioning of the mechanisms by which additional liquidity ends up sloshing around in the system However in total an expansion of the balance sheet is largely an expansion of the money supply This can be in the form of margin collateral reserves which can be used to print new money on leverage issue loans to businesses The Fed balance sheet also contains govt issued debt aka bondstreasuries It also has about 3T of mortgage backed assets But bottom line both regular bank money M2 and the reserves on the Fed balance sheet side of the equation are flatshrinking So theres less total money sloshing around the system to make NumbersGoUp NGU Overview of US Bond yield rates Top Left Average yield rate of the overall US bond also called treasuries market Top Right The interest rate paid for a 10year maturity US govt issued bond Bottom Left The interest rate paid for a 30year maturity US govt issued bond Bottom Right An birds eye view of the inversion between yields Below zero is overall inverted Bond markets are complex and I only understand the basics But essentially when govts need more money than taxes provide they create IOUs interest yield and sell them on the open market Private entities either buy them or central banks the Fed steps in to make up the difference and buy them In a very broad view slowly falling rates means an expanding money supply and NGU for 2 reasons 1 Lower rates means cheaper loans aka cheaper to print money and to take leverage 2 It creates demand for institutions to buy bonds today because they know if they wait yields will be lower later on So it creates a self reinforcing loop Well that loop is broken now Rates are rising People dont want to buy bonds today because they know that tomorrow theyll get a better rate Yields rise more and it also becomes a self reinforcing loop But what happens when rates rise You cant go buy 3 homes so easily and rent out two of them Rocket Jesus has to pay higher interest rates to squander printed money on digging expensive tunnels making overpriced cars and blowing up rockets Hedge funds cant so easily bid up and buy up loads of high risk assets with fresh cash These higher rates are happening against a backdrop of a shrinking money supply Cherry on top Inflation is still highrising as the economy adjusts to the shock of money supply that flooded the markets in 2020 and early 2021 So despite having less money supply for risk assets stuff costs more which further eats in to the capital which people mightve otherwise had available to buy risk assets Last word about bonds is the yield curve inversion Where longer term bonds are yielding less than short term bonds If you lock money for longer you expect to get higher interest rate Big yield curve inversions and corrections to normal have typically been associated with high risk of negative returns on stocks They represent maximum distortion in debt markets So now finally after examining the system as a whole the contracting money supply the funds flow which result from this contraction understanding the nature of rising yields while valuedemand for bonds drops We can better contextualize where stocks and crypto exist at this moment The simple reality is that I just cant find where exactly the large funds flows into crypto are going to come from Retail is exhausted They already bought the dip 3 times and theyre paying more for basic living than ever before Smart money big money very clearly appear to be in the safety trade DXY and reverse repos Institutional still isnt buying GBTC even at a 35 discount to spot I suppose you could pray to Sam Bankman Paolo CZ Justin Sun Barry Silbert and Mr Armstrange to pump your bags for you against the larger market forces Who knows maybe they will The Bank of England gave the very first hope of respite from these trends however its not nearly enough to have more than a fleeting effect on the current trajectory We would need to see other central banks follow suit particularly the Fed But theyre very unlikely to do so At least not for the next few months Besides what do we know about insiders and news cycles If this was going to be a true reversal markets shouldve shown strength before the news Insiders position themselves first and then the plebs get the news afterwards in order to augment the tradebags already made by insiders So what was this It was a ploy To get people off their shorts and fomod into the long side of the market Nasdaq lifetime channel Nasdaq local view of bullbear market As predicted Nasdaq has returned inside of its lifetime ascending channel The yellow line in the local view is the precovid highs This level is very natural and it will to act like a magnate from here on out The daily weekly and monthly closes for both NDX and SP closed below the June swing lows Theres now a bullhorn pattern on both NDX and SP futures markets Typically broadening structures like this are the result of MMs running stop hunts against the organic trend of the market Clearing out the crowded side of an otherwise correct trade by too many players Stock markets have very similar pattern now as to the May crash You can see that a very similar pattern played out last week as happened with the May crash in stocks Again a wideningbroadening structure Bitcoin also has a very similar pattern as to the MarApr rally and May crash I havent compressedexpanded the timeline of the overlay Its a direct copypaste Bitcoin divided by the Nasdaq weekly candles TOTAL marketcap minus stablecoins divided by Nasdaq BLXNDX is an incredibly illuminating chart and I highly recommend that all crypto traders studyexamine this chart deeply There is a wealth of information there that helps you to see how the price of Bitcoin relates to its companion techrisk market Neither of these charts above are particularly strong At best crypto is sitting at the top of the range in a spot of important horizontal significance While theyre not strong these charts dont seem too terribly weak either Mildly negative Hypothetically if NDX continued its trajectory towards precovid highs 11 and BLXNDX dropped to the bottom of its range about 14 implies a price of about 14k for Bitcoin Which is suspiciously close to the lower bound regression analysis of Bitcoin And also suspiciously close to the June 2019 swing high Last week the BoE shifted the probabilities of market outcomes by a little bit no doubt about it It even caused a secondary liquidity run to the upside particularly in cryptos But after thinking about it and looking at all the metrics that have kept me on the right side of this market for the past year its difficult to believe that the cash needed to pump these markets will just materialize Of course it could potentially happen as MMs have loads of capital on both sides of the trade and could choose to do so Typically though they need a good motivation like the massive 2020 stimulus and monetary injections where they needed to pump hard get the fomo going and distribute their centralized bags at as high a price as possible This BoE announcement although mildly annoying in the short term is a nice little addition to the notion that this next low could be the bottom At a minimum it definitely appears to have delayed a market breakdown But the likelyhood for me still falls clearly on the short side If nothing else it is the time value of money and risks of being long right here which very clearly prevent a reaccumulation of my crypto bags If Im wrong its very likely Ill have the opportunity to rebuy near these levels sometime in the future And that rebuy will happen much closer in time to the next bull market But rebuying here only to lose 3050 while waiting maybe 12 months to recover There is still a riskprobability of an 8k Bitcoin as well It wouldnt totally break the chart Thats just too much risk Ill take the minor loss of being wrong and buying slightly higher in the future with more gains right around the corner than take the major risk of losing half my stack and a year or more of time value Thats about as full as I can manage for one day Hope yall had a nice weekend,Positive,0.9969

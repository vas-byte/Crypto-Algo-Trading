should Hi everyone I posted this on rcryptocurrency but not sure if it would get approved there So posting it here anyway since SOL is my biggest bag Plus I much prefer this sub anyway Prelude Before I get into the weeds let me start by saying that this is purely meant to be an educational post It is not meant to bash any project On the contrary I hope the many DeFi 20 projects still around will eventually recover I know many have rugged shame on those teams However to recover we need to stop the charade Many users still assume that the high APYs equate to free money and that everyone can magically buy lambos if they hold for a year 33 is a myth Sadly many of these users remain uninformed because of ultra defensive mods any form of meaningful real discussion is dismissed as FUD and users who dare speak out get banned from their subs or discords It takes a lot of effort to get a project going and for what its worth I believe many users and devs went head in first like I did without truly understanding the economics of DeFi 20 Hopefully this post brings to light the reality of things and hopefully we can have meaningful discussions on how the projects can create actual value for all its users The Rise While DeFi 20 was started by Olympus DAO early in April 2021 it only really hit mainstream crypto a few months ago around the OctNov 2021 period when multiple forks of Olympus DAO started appearing across multiple chains OHM hit a local peak in Oct rallying nearly 5x from its low in Aug The price appreciation itself is enough to make anyone turn heads but what really drew people in was the fact that it was promising insane APYs If my memory serves me right it was giving close to 8000 at that point This sounds small today if we compare it to the 80k or 800k that some projects are offering now but back then only comparison was yield farming on DEXes giving you two digit APY on average with some occasional three digit ones A good number of people were naturally skeptical to begin with but many saw the success of OHM and were now presented with the opportunity to take part in something identical as many projects were forked but at an early stage Some went further to try to read the docs watched multiple YouTube videos chatted up the community to understand further all in hopes to understand the mechanics of this amazing new protocol Is it too good to be true Or did we the crypto community really come up with something so revolutionary that we all can truly get rich together if we simply held The game theory component really sounded plausible and it seems to have been proven true because OHM was already half a year old Many calculated that they only needed a month or two just to recover their capital solely from the emissions and decided that the odds were in their favor I was one of such people And boy were we so wrong Econs 101 Unfortunately despite how cool game theory is and how this revolutionary experiment found some early success you cannot escape the basics Value needs to come from somewhere If a system does not bring in value externally it is a zero sum game within the system In a zero sum game for you to make money someone else must lose money No matter how you dress it up add sparkles blow bubbles this fundamental truth remains But Moo I have more tokens now so youre wrong Yeah not really You may have more tokens now but in the absence of new investors your portfolio value remains the same The difference is that you may have started out with buying 10 tokens for 100 each and now you have 100 tokens that are worth 10 each Your portfolio was worth 1000 then and its worth 1000 now Of course this didnt happen because what happened in reality was not only did insufficient new investors come in many old investors yanked their money out ie dumped on you So now there is less money in the system for everyone which means on average everyone who did not yank is sitting on losses But Moo I can just hold with my diamond hands and given enough time I will make money because of the rebases Its all about the 33 You know nothing Sorry fren Reminder In the absence of new money you will never recover You may get more tokens but your portfolio value remains the same You may be getting that insane APY but your token value will simply keep depreciating till the end of time Yes even way below the supposed 1 intrinsic value another myth by the way the actual math is it is a parabolic curve that tends to zero but never actually touches it The only way you can recover is that if new money comes in to feed the system And you now make money by dumping on them The Hard Truth And that brings us to our next point New money coming in to feed old money Sounds familiar Thats right Good ol Mr Ponzi Many people dont like this word but unfortunately it really is true for most cryptocurrencies There are many definitions of financial terms but for the sake of this educational piece lets define a few key words so were all on the same page as to what they mean here when I use them 1 Investment Money Money that people are expecting to yield a profit from 2 Revenue Money that people are happy to give up in exchange for goods or services They are not expecting to get their money back In the absence of revenue a project is a zero sum game Investors with their investment money cannot make a profit other than by taking money from another investor Whether you like it or not this is a ponzi scheme So are all cryptocurrencies ponzi schemes A lot are but not all Take Ethereum for example while the gas fees are truly disgusting you dont expect to get your gas money back You understand it is an expense you have to pay and you are willing to pay for it due to the service you receive being able to use the network These gas fees are revenue for Ethereum what they choose to do with it eg burn it is another topic altogether Another example would be DEXes most will charge a percentage fee for using their liquidity pools Usually a large portion of the fees go to to the liquidity pool providers while the rest goes to the DEX Investing in Ponzis Since so many projects are ponzis should we not touch them at all Well generally you should avoid them but there are exceptions Remember our Econs 101 Value needs to come from somewhere So long as the project can eventually bring in revenue ie external value this revenue can be used to pay its investors Not all projects will hit the ground running with a revenue model but if they have the ability to continue in the long haul chances are that they should come up with a revenue generation model Then it might be worth looking at But honestly it would be a safer bet to invest in projects that are already generating revenue Why target DeFi 20 I know there are many nonDeFi 20 projects that technically classify as a ponzi so you may be wondering why I created this giant post specifically about DeFi 20 Well because none of the other projects have insane APYs Sure some of you know the economics but unfortunately the majority naturally equate the APYs to the amount of money they will make Heck theres even a project that has a calculator to show how many lambos you can buy given enough time This to me is a giant lie that DeFi 20 projects are perpetuating and I dont think thats healthy for the community Innovation is great and DeFi 20 actually brought in some pretty cool concepts like self ownership of liquidity pools Innovation should continue if we want crypto to lead the pack but it should never be at the expense of taking advantage of others If we truly want to bring about a brighter future we need to do things above board and be forthcoming with the risks This is one of the tenants as to how we bring in greater adoption into crypto The Future of DeFi 20 There are a few projects that have already started on the path of revenue generation and I commend them for it However we must not kid ourselves that having something like a 8000 APY is realistic Maybe one might succeed and turn into the next richest man on earth but the odds are exceedingly low Reasonably by investing its treasury into stablecoin farms projects should be able to get anywhere between 1020 quite easily Maybe work a little harder dig a little deeper and throw in some luck and maybe just maybe you can return a 100 gain to your investors But higher yields equal higher risks And the more you push it the more you put at risk all your investor money turning to zero Mind you a large treasury also doesnt equate a bigger return for all you investors In fact the larger the treasury the harder it is to generate huge percentage gains For example if your treasury was only worth 10 you could perhaps turn that into a 10x gain by using that to setup a lemonade stand and get 100 back But if your treasury was worth 1 billion you better have some genius level ideas as to how you are going to generate 10 billion back within a year also Elon Musk and Jeff Bezoz would probably want to hire you So what should projects do Start generating revenue AND nuke that APY down to the actual percentage your project can return Investors at that point can then properly decide if this is the level of riskreturns they want and they can choose to stay or leave accordingly The sooner projects accept this truth the sooner they can start working to actually return you your money sorry I know most people are heavily down at this point I am too And for those projects who continue to ban constructive criticisms and want to stay in fairytale land leave the first instance you can Ultimately your fate lies in whether they can execute on the best ideas If they are not sourcing as many ideas as they can and executing on those ideas it is a massive red flag I hope this brings to light what DeFi 20 actually is and I am positive that as a community we can continue to innovate further to bring DeFi to a whole new level,Positive,0.9996

banned forever from rCryptoCurrency aka not even allowed to appeal the ban and muted from sending direct messages to mods for breaking the rule that says Im not allowed to complain publicly What a joke Heres the ban message Here is the set of rules that they claim I broke I find it ironic that one of the sections under rule 3 reason for the ban is No pumping shilling or FUD fear uncertainty doubt Here was the original post Title Putting Solana into Perspective READ FIRST BEFORE DOWNVOTING Disclaimer I hold a significant amount of the following cryptocurrencies BTC ETH SOL ADA ALGO ATOM 1 Lots are complaining about the recent exploit that was in a smart contract that was using a deprecated function that had unintended side effects if extra logic wasnt implemented Lets compare how Wormhole handled this compared to the ETH DAO hack In the Wormhole hack they fixed the bug and covered the 250 million that the hacker stole with help from other partners of course In the DAO hack Ethereum changed the state against the blockchain rules effectively reverting transactions ok not technically on the blockchain but if you rollback the state the same result is achieved which is not how blockchains are supposed to work Both of these exploits resulted in a large amount of ETH stolen the way both of them were handled was very different 2 People claim that Solana isnt decentralized enough Solana has a Nakamoto coefficient of 19 meaning that 19 validators must collude to halt the network those 19 make up 33 of the network so it isnt enough to achieve consensus but it is enough to break quorum On the other hand BTC and ETH have a Nakamoto coefficient of under 5 meaning that fewer than 5 mining pools make up more than 51 of the network hashrate That means that Solana is actually significantly more decentralized based on Nakamoto coefficient and that number is expected to grow with the noncustodial stake pools becoming more popular Furthermore there are 15k validators for reference there are around 3k on Cardano so thats not a bad number of validators 3 People say that Solana is too expensive for running a validator People who say this have never bought an ASIC or GPU 5k10k for running a validator node on Solana you can pay the same price for building a highpowered mining rig on BTC or ETH For the people complaining that you need a large amount of Solana to be staked to be profitable as a validator given fees on vote transactions not only does Solana Foundation have a delegation program where the foundations reserves are staked to smaller validators but also in ETH2 you need 32 ETH 128k at the ATH around 4000ETH minimum to stake as a validator 4 People complain about token distribution on Solana not hearing the same complaints about how the ETH premine ETH2 PoS is risky or complaints about Satoshi if hes still around holding 1 million BTC Also token distribution always gets better over time Solana is still a relatively young network 5 Network went down in September for 19 hours and hasnt been down since then The reason the network went down is that validators were prioritizing high compute operations over consensus this has now been fixed There was no off switch the validators crashed on their own from the overload and cascading effect There was no on switch either in fact it took 19 hours because 66 of the validators by stake needed to come back online to achieve consensus on the upgrade Despite that people keep saying network is down like every other week when its not Fine transactions are only running at a few hundred TPS votes not included instead of a few thousand during these periods of congestion so maybe its a bit slower and you have to try a few times but people here will say that the network crashed when it hasnt This congestion is a sign of high activity on the chain and when this happens to other chains ETH and MATIC fees increase significantly Solana doesnt currently have a fee market but the devs are currently working on building one and also tackling this problem of high congestion in a creative way by increasing fees only on the smart contracts causing congestion while allowing the rest of the network to operate with normal fees Furthermore despite the occasional congestion Solana has smart contracts that actually work most of the time and scale to large numbers of concurrent users looking at you Cardano with SundaeSwap 6 Solanas main network is literally called MainnetBeta and everyone is treating it like there should be exactly zero problems Bitcoin went down back in 2013 when it was still a young network and its easy to forget since its so long ago but these outages arent a unique problem for newer chains Please try to keep the comments civil and purely factbased thanks Also no network is perfect they all have their flaws but its remember to put things into perspective once in a while Edit The title means dont downvote before reading not downvote after reading You

it funny that people are so quick to call NFTs a scam when its a space that is so new and still finding its feet in Web 30 Funnily enough its always towards the trading component and never about use cases outside of this niche within the space Usually because they have no idea of the other utility thats being created and built Its undeniable that the list of use cases will continue to grow and they will become part of our lives over time Some of the below are either happening now or will eventually become tangible in 202223 Vertical Marketplaces NFT projects will shift towards DTC marketplaces like larvalabs and SolanaMBS Managing user experience is critical for retention and eliminating 3rd parties doesnt hurt Soulbound NFTs NFTs are lauded for their transferability but there are many use cases for nontransferable tokens drivers licenses diplomas certifications proof of attendance etc Soulbound NFTs lockin provenance and can not be sold Retail Sector Retailers from 711 to Gamestop will use NFTs to incentivize IRL transactions leveraging creators to drive traffic to storefronts For example Yeezy NFTs that airdrop with purchases from Gap stores or NFTs that unlock exclusive features for Tesla vehicles Borrowing Platforms Because NFTs can unlock temporary accesslike entry to conferencesmarkets for shortterm lending are emerging Imagine this as a marketplace StubHub but for NFTs NFT Indexes Getting exposure to hundreds of NFTs via indexes will boom as market movers tap collectors for funds Imagine a Christies NFT ETF They have the influence to get assets to liquidityinvestors will ape into that It will also broaden support for NFT communities Bounties Creators and brands will drop unique quests within communities rewarding completion with NFTs This could be anything from completing a questionnaire to referring members into the community to attending events Bounties can be highly competitive or open wide Social Investing Web3 streamlines investing by reducing manual processes like spreadsheet mgmt signature collection It also acts as a social recordstartups like PartyRound will build networks around such activity and reinforce them with NFTs Legal The benefits of block security and its ability to trigger transactions via oracles will accelerate the adoption of web3 legal services contract development A DocuSign killer or acquisition target will be built in 2022 and it will deliver NFTs to contract executors Services NFTs will unlock access to services and hobbyist communities QAs and tutorials with influencer chefs photographers doctors and niche enthusiastic communities will boom This will also extend into IRL services like transportation hotels and spas Content Submission Users will submit content like shortform videos reviews and tutorials in exchange for NFTs Its a marketing flywheel Rights can be programmed into contracts so that the use of the contributors content in advertising could yield their future profits Activism Communities where NFT ownership supports political causes will gain traction as millions flow into community wallets Imagine environmental NFT collectives where sales are directed towards lobbying efforts and those efforts are coordinated by a community DAO Social Feed Marketplaces Social feeds based on NFT collections will emerge providing insight into the strategy of top collectors and a platform for collectors to interact These feeds will evolve into social commerce marketplaces featuring reviews analytics and more Multiplayer NFTs will create hive activity by incentivizing group behavior MMORPGs that unlock levels once 10k users have aped in Airdrops of rare NFTs to collector cohorts that have signed contracts to merge their baselayer NFTs Collecting is going to become a team sport Collateralization To date lenders have been averse to NFT holders borrowing against their assets But as institutional money flows in and assets become better stores of value collateral markets will promise flexibility and liquidity for all NFT holders not just whales Fractionalization Splitting up NFTs into individual shares gives more people exposure to bluechip assets like owning a piece of a CryptoPunk The result More liquidity for holders and more appreciation of bluechip assets as money enters the markets DeFi As enthusiasts become more comfortable staking and farming their holdings for yield NFTs promise incentives beyond APY NFTs will become base DeFi assets with community access included These wont be simple savings playstheyll also be investments in communities Loyalty Exchanges As brands and creators seek to reinforce loyalty community behavior will be rewarded with NFTs Did the member contribute content NFT Complete surveys NFT Make a purchase NFT Tokens are more liquid and bragworthy than traditional discount codes RD Brands and creators will exchange NFTs for insights on product development pain points marketing claims roadmap and more The NFTs will unlock early access to product releases and potential profit sharing Brands will track and maintain these key relationships Customer Cohort NFTs Imagine receiving an NFT for being one of the first Air Jordan customers and how valuable that would be today How Nike might reward you years later with special access and product Cohort NFTs prove that you took a certain action at a certain time Education and Customer Support Upon demonstrating exceptional knowledge of a brands product users can receive NFTs in exchange for onboarding newbies into the community or providing support This can be exponentially more impactful than a brand employee doing the same Leaderboards NFT communities will gamify by highlighting the performance and participation of top holders Top contributors will receive rewards and clout thereby incentivizing communities to hold and participate in order to secure better returns on their investments Take a second to actually look

uses a Solana smart contract for job posting We currently have an option to allow users for posting fee with Solana and will include the payment option with our Solana token called Code later We also plan to include more Solana relevant tech like Serum Dex and NFTs and the market for it with Solana and use our token with them You can read this at our website also CodeJobs Whitepaper Disclaimer This whitepaper does not represent an offer document of any kind or financial recommendations or prospectus and is not intended to illustrate a solicitation for investment and the information provided shall not be considered legal financial business tax or investment advice Please seek necessary advice from your tax advisor your legal or any other professional advisor or your local authorities to assist you in making your own decisions 1 Introduction In the modern digital world there are various platforms which a person can utilize to find a job such as LinkedIn for the professional network or social media platforms like Reddit subforums groups There are also other places where a user can seek for professional advice like devto stackexchange etc instead but they are not specialized in producing blockchain content and job research The problem that arose in these platforms is they are not full featured in helping recruiters in finding a candidate or the candidate himself to find a job nor offer any incentive for sharing users to share their own skills since they are either focused only on the recruitment or on the skill sharing without direct returns for the content creator There is also no way to capitalize on the skills of users nor to show them in an ordered manner to attract more job offers It is about having either a completely lax approach like on rforhire which doesnt have an efficient way of sorting or filtering job proposals or a rather strict approach like on LinkedIn which does work for many traditional jobs but not for web3blockchain jobs where titles and one own background or connections dont give the full picture of their actual skills and difficulty in paying with cryptocurrencies because of still unsettled legal and tax issues etc In other words the digital world and most of its platfomrs are not moving fast enough to use blockchain techs fully and mostly using the old methods So the CodeJobs team designed a network to help recruiters business and blockchain startup owners to find skilled professionals and the candidates in search for a job that suits them to find it while letting them have a way to share their experience and skills in a more complete blockchain user friendly way We believe that having a network designed from the ground up to host especially blockchain related and cryptocurrency paying job offers and serving as a community can offer a unique approach to job recruitment and skill sharing for crypto industry 2 The platform General Our website address is codenjobscom It is serving thousands users monthly and has several features Blogging intended to serve as backbone of community building allowing people to share their skills by producing walkthroughs and guides or share a piece of information in an article This feature is free to use We intend to hire more professional writers to produce educational material for new blockchain users and to kickstart the interest towards this part Job posting with the chance to filter jobs based on broad categories eg programming blockchain marketing etc type full time part time free lance contract internship company salary location skills and method of payment fiat or crypto The feature for posting jobs will be possible to use by spending our token Solana or other stable token at our platform Researching and filtering jobs posted at our website is free of charge Profiles with the ability to filter possible candidates and search among the users who optionally provide their information at our forhire page It is also possible to decide not to share your information and participate in the community growth and use our services Direct messaging system is to help the recruiters tcandidates and normal users to connect privately with each other You will be also able to trade NFTs we will publish and the market for them and other digital products directly with another user without need for leaving our platform with this feature A bot built with Rust bot framework Teloxide used to provide support to new users discovering our network and to help them navigate through our channels of information by using various commands to interact with and find a job as fast as possible without need for visiting jobs page from our website We welcome Rust Haskell and other low level developers If you are interested in our website and have a skill for improving it Feel free to contact us Our Vision Our website CodeJobs has various features to help both the recruiter and the candidate at the same time a job seeker can share their skills with a blog post their profile and titles Our users can also share their portfolios all in the same page being able to passively show their skills and reach more efficiently the recruiters without any need for sharing the same all the time The recruiters can also contact candidates with a direct message browse their profile jobs and posts in an ordered manner by filtering them on our site or post a job with our the form with a Solana smart contract for it we are preparing to use with our token We plan to include a resume that users can allow who can read a review review previous history reputation referral system and more features to help job candidates and recruiters We also plan to hire qualified writers and content creators ourselves to bootstrap our educational contents and to help new crypto users to learn how to use blockchain and its relevant techs We will also focus on Solana at the beginning since this is the platform where we deployed our token and have a lot of benefits such as speed low fee helpful and fast developing ecosystem and experienced and well thought development experience behind it Upcoming web3 features With the adoption of blockchain techs we will have a job posting system to receive cryptocurrencies as payment methods including our token We are in the process of upgrading our platform to more web3 capabilities We allow users to use their Solana NFTs for their profiles We will produce NFTs by paying artists then we will build an NFT market so users can trade the NFTs for profile image and other services we will provide We will also deploy a decentralized exchange on the platform with Solana or ETH variants later to allow users to trade their tokens directly without need for leaving our website and have a mean to sustain our service without depending only on the token We will also hire more professional developers and UIUX designers to enrich and improve our site experience and developing our roadmap objectives and timelines 3 Project Tokenomics Token Listing Tokenomics To facilitate the job posting with cryptocurrency and to make the system more crypto user oriented we decided to mint a token of our own using Solana network to deploy it because of its protocol capabilities and lot of benefits We use Solana because of its speed and low fee It will be the best way to use our service blockchain techs Any wallet that can hold Solana SPL tokens can send receive or hold our token as well The goal of introducing CODE is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the CodeJobs Ecosystem without any intermediaries such as centralized third party entityinstitutioncredit Contract address Code7hV6DaK5Werof8c7vPwBxLvhmEWVUbU2AfhBZArB Symbol CODE

be allocated on product development marketing legal counseling day to day operations contingency fund and interaction with investors More on it on next section 4 Funding allocation Whitepaper funding allocation We plan to generate funds from the first IEO and on multiple exchanges later 50 funds will be spent on product development to provide a strong backbone to the platform we intend to build We will focus on dev side and improving our website services We intend to spend 10 of collected funds for marketing deals 10 in business development eg exchange fees and liquidity 10 for legal counseling and other legal expenditures 5 will be allocated for with investors and communities 5 as contingency fund 10 for the day to day operations of our own platform and community 5 Technical Strengths Roadmap Our token is deployed on Solana blockchain for its speed and robustness while remaining decentralized and with low transaction fees compared to blockchains like ETH Solana has 60 thousand times lower transaction fees Our planned Roadmap is as follows Smart contract for Job posting to be expected in Q1 2022 Our own decentralized exchange to be expected in Q2 2022 We will deploy our NFT project to be expected in Q3 2022 NFT market to be expected in Q4 2022,Positive,0.9995

analysis of the much hyped metaverse project SOLICE on the Solana blockchain SOLICE is advertised as a virtual reality metaverse project on the Solana blockchain The fundamental basis for my conclusion is that the product is and has only ever been incentivised for the mass holders The airdrop rewards price and distribution of their NFTs staking APY and the initial ICO was all catered to uberwealthy only Ill outline my experiences with this project below The original buyin via Selenium was for whale holders only and set at 007c After the public launch on gateio they mass dumped after it climbed to 4 Now those rich have all left and the bag holders are stuck with something still heavily overvalued The price of their NFTs which launched publicly after a buyin lottery are set to a floor price well above most people Even with the price of SOL still undervalued youre still looking at about 100 per NFT and in all cases you dont even know what youre getting Many people wanted to buy the land in the Solice metaverse but the only way for this to happen has been to cough up a small fortune or lock thousands of Solice away in staking Fast forward a few weeks and the launch of the NFTs was a dismal failure The products were lame and not up to the standard promised Many users have reported disappointment at the mystery box rarity concept One user in particular spent approximately 10k and received only generic items worth significantly less than their investment The NFTs are suppose to be unique but most are straight up duplicates with the tiniest alteration to each A gamble of course but when one user receives a legendary item on their first try amongst a fouledup launch protocol questions need to be asked Even the names of the NFTs are terrible To provide an example one user bought two avatars at launch They were advertised as unique NFTS Cost approximately 1000 each x200B Solice Genesis 525 x200B x200B Solice Genesis 529 x200B Meanwhile the top ten wallets for this product still hold 95 of all the tokens for the entire project It is said that these are locked for two years but it is not clear exactly how and when they will be distributed Users in the discord have tried to seek clarification on issues but are met only with silence or the most vague of responses It took them days to even acknowledge there was a problem with the launch of the NFTs and even now they are still putting the blame on one of their partners and when I tried to politely question all these points on their Discord I was instantly banned I have a second account to continue to monitor the discord but I do not say anything for fear of being Instabanned again I was fortunate to get into this project on launch and cashed out my initial investment at the beginning But since then Ive become completely disillusioned by the devs and the entire team I never hope anything fails You should always do your own research But after my experiences with the metaverse token Im out More recently land was released for sale This is something that many users had been requesting for quite some time Yet once again the requirements to purchase are hugely restrictive Some users who have been in from the beginning but missed out on the purchase of an avatar are just learning that an avatar is required for the purchase of land This is despite avatars originally only being made available on whitelists or via a lottery And of course many are relisted on Magic Eden with an insane markup Oh and if you want to buy land or an avatar but you have your SLC staked then you have to buy more SOLICE to buy land right now The releases are conveniently timed so that anyone who staked can not withdraw their funds in time to purchase the NFTs But dont forget you need to hold an Avatar at a cost of more than 1000 to be able to qualify to be whitelisted to be able to buy land Should it come as a surprise that the launch of the land sale was also a disaster Probably not Again users have no choice what land they are buying only the size of it For all they know theyre buying a piece of land on the outskirts of town The partners were all given the larger blocks as part of the program The developers are blaming Solana for the problems but essentially the issue is users have paid for their land but transactions failed etc and locked their funds So users ended up with nothing and had to prove their failed transactions to get a refund oh and they still didnt get any land Now its also starting to emerge that several users insiders gamed the system and managed to obtain several land items and still get their tokens refunded The devs even had to go through and release this Google Sheet explaining which wallets were allowed to get land but if anyone else tries it theyre keeping your tokens The discord is currently filled with hundreds of users asking what happened to their NFTs Users bought heavily driving the price up in preparation for the recent sale and were still unable to secure land even if they had already offloaded thousands to secure the avatar requirements Some are even complaining that theyre stuck with useless tokens now that they cant sell because the price is crashing The only remaining land for sale is the 1x1 block at a cost of around 600 There are multiple reasons Ive outlined and multiple reasons I havent But the biggest telling of the corruption of the Devs and mods is that anytime a user challenges a reason or justification they are instantly banned from the discord This has created one of the loudest and most cultlike echo chambers I have ever seen As always DYOR but get out of this project if you can,Negative,-0.9981

Upcoming Upgrades on Solana That Will Improve Network Performance Source x200B Solana has announced three main changes in its mitigation plan to address the stability and resilience of the network 1 QUIC 2 Stake Weighted QoS 3 Fee Markets The measures are targeting the intense traffic responsible for two out of the three recent incidents Although the changes being proposed by Solana developers are considered abstract or deeply technical for the general part of the community the concepts are not completely new being imported from other already mature systems In this article we will try to break down the technicalities and explain them in simple terms The current Solana client version for validator nodes v110 already paves the way for some of these improvements to be iterated on until optimal market fit Fee prioritization is targeted for the v111 release according to the official announcement Some Context on Network Communication Protocols Solana used to adopt the User Datagram Protocol UDP for transmitting transactions between nodes in the network Nodes send transactions through UDP directly to the leader the staked node responsible for proposing the block in that particular slot without a previous connection being established UDP does not handle traffic congestion or delivery confirmation for data In situations of network congestion the leader is unable to handle the volume of incoming traffic which means some packets get dropped Even at quiet times some level of packet loss is normal By sending the same transaction multiple times users have a greater chance that at least one of their attempts will arrive Fig 1 Illustration of UDP protocol featuring multiple data transfers that can burden the receiver and lose packets in the way In contrast to UDP is the Transmission Control Protocol TCP TCP includes more sophisticated features but for this to work it requires a session ie a known connection was previously established between the client and the server The receiver acknowledges acks packets and the sender knows when to stop sending packets in case of intense traffic TCP allows for retransmitting lost packets once the sender stops receiving acks the interpretation is that something must be lost so the sender should slow down TCP is not ideal for some use cases though In particular it sequences all traffic If one portion of the data is lost everything after it needs to wait That is not great for Solana transactions which are independent Fig 2 Illustration of TCP protocol featuring serial data transfer Lost packets affect subsequent ones since the sender waits for server acknowledgement 1 QUIC QUIC is a generalpurpose protocol which is used by more than half of all connections from the Chrome web browser to Googles servers QUIC is the name of the protocol not an acronym QUIC is an alternative to TCP with similar features a session which then enables backpressure to slow the sender down but it also has a concept of separate streams so if one transaction gets dropped it doesnt need to block the remaining ones Fig 3 And QUIC protocol illustration representing a mix of features from TCP and UDP Solana is a permissionless network Anyone running a Solana client is a node in the network and is able to send messages to the leader Nodes can operate as validators when it is signing and sending votes and or they can expose their RPC Remote Procedure Call interface to receive messages from applications such as wallets and DEXs and send those to the leader The leader listens on a UDP port and RPCs listen on a TCP port Given the leader schedule is public sophisticated players with algorithmic strategies bots are able to send transactions to the leader directly bypassing any additional RPC nodes that would only increase latency With the leader being spammed the network gets congested and that deteriorates performance The UDP port used by the leader will be replaced by a QUIC port 2 Stake Weighted QoS Quality of Service QoS is the practice of prioritizing certain types of traffic when there is more traffic than the network can handle Last January after Solana faced performance issues as automated trading strategies aka liquidator bots spammed the network with more than 2 million packets per second mostly duplicate messages Anatoly Yakovenko mentioned in a tweet that they would bring the QoS concept to Solana The Leader currently tries to process transactions as soon as they arrive Because IPs are verifiable through QUIC validators will be able to prioritize and limit the traffic for specific connections Instead of validators and RPCs blasting transactions at the leader as fast as they can effectively DoSing the leader they would have a persistent QUIC connection If the network IP gets congested it will be possible to identify and apply policies to large traffic connections limiting the number of messages the node can send throttle These policies are known as QoS Internally staked weighted QoS means queuing transactions in different channels depending on the sender weighted by the amount of SOL staked Nonstaked nodes will then be incentivized to send transactions to staked nodes first instead of sending directly to the leader for a better chance of finding execution since excess messages from nonstaked nodes will most likely be dropped by the leader According to Anatoly will be responsible for shaping their own traffic and applying policies that will avoid vulnerability For example if a particular node sends huge amounts of transactions even if they are staked validators can take action ignoring the connections established with this node in order to protect network performance 3 Fee Markets Solana fees are currently fixed and charged for each signature required in a transaction 5000 lamports 0000005 SOL If there is high competition in a specific market users face the risk of not getting transactions executed With a fixed transaction fee there is no way to communicate priority or compete by paying more to get their transaction prioritized Without alternatives users usually bots spam transactions to the leader and soontobe leaders in hope that at least one of them is successful In many situations this behavior generates more traffic than what the network can process A priority fee is soon to be included in Solana allowing users to specify an arbitrary additional fee to be collected upon execution of the transaction and its inclusion in a block This mechanism would not only help the network to prioritize timesensitive transactions but also tends to reduce the amount of invalid or duplicated messages sent by algorithms since speculative operations can become unprofitable with an increase in the total cost The ratio of this fee to the requested compute units the computational cost to the program to perform all operations will serve as a transactions execution priority weight This ratio will be used by nodes to prioritize the transactions they send to the leader Additional fees will be treated identically to the base fee today 50 of the fees paid will be collected by the leader and 50 will be burned At this point you could think of several blocks being filled only with transactions targeting an NFT mint However there is a limit time for each account to be locked for writing on a single slot 600 to 800 milliseconds The remnant block space can be filled with transactions writing in different accounts even if they offer a smaller priority fee Highpriority transactions trying to write to an account that has already reached its limit will be included in the next block Each Solana transaction specifies the writable accounts the portion of the state that will be modified This allows transactions to be executed in parallel as long as transactions are independent ie do not access the same accounts If two transactions write or read to the same account these two transactions can not be processed in parallel because they affect the same state The Solana team argues that the priority fee will then behave as parallel auctions affecting only the hot market instead of the global price allowing the fee to grow for a specific queue of transactions trying to write in that account only How does the user know the fee to adopt to get a mint RPCs nodes will need to estimate an adequate fee most likely using a simple statistical method for example averaging the actual cost of similar transactions in previous N blocks or even a quantile The optimal method will depend on the market and whether fees for similar transactions are more volatile high demand or stable less demand In practice the priority fee can have a global effect if the parallel auctions are not implemented on the validator client With RPCs and users being responsible for arbitrarily setting it during high intense traffic applications will likely try to get priority even though they do not interact with the hot market causing an increase in the fee price for other lower demand dApps Fee prioritization is targeted for the v111 release according to the official announcement In Short The present article covered the three pieces Solana is actively working on to deal with congestion issues which include changing the communication protocol from UDP to QUIC adding stakeweighted QoS for transaction prioritization and a fee market that increases fees with high demand All of these 3 improvements aspire to improve the performance of Solana which has been experiencing degraded performance quite often We hope it was possible to clarify these concepts and understand the motivations and choices being made Exploring Solana source code would be an essential next step to investigate the exact metrics being implemented in QoS to select or drop transactions or the mechanism behind the increase and decrease of fees and other questions that remain unanswered I would like to thank the Chorus One team for the enlightening

Good The Bad and The Ugly SOL Sweet Friday 24 June GM and welcome to SOL Sweet Holy sht what a week its been for Solana Check this out Sunday Solend has a brain explosion Monday xNFTs are announced Tuesday Rest day Wednesday Magic Eden becomes a unicorn Thursday Solana launches a mobile phone Friday SOL Sweet hits inboxes Buckle up baby Were gonna cover all that and more in the next 3 minutes and 58 seconds Solend what were you thinking Solana lending platform Solend did something crazy this week They passed a vote to take emergency control of a whales account to avoid a massive liquidation event happening on chain Yes you read that right They tried to centralize DeFi Lets step through how they got to that decision and whats happened since A whale deposited 57M SOL or 170M on Solend The platform claims that was 95 of the pools deposits The whale then used their SOL as collateral to borrow 108M in Stablecoins If SOL hit 2230 they would be liquidated for 20 21M Solend were concerned this liquidation happening on chain could cause massive congestion and crash Solana again They feared it could cause the price of SOL to drop further triggering more liquidations across other DEXs on Solana Solend said they had tried to contact the whale to get them to reduce their risk but they didnt get a response Now hold on shts about to get crazy Instead of letting things ride they issue a governance proposal to take control of the whales account and execute the liquidation OTC over the counter This would have a smaller impact on the price of SOL by avoiding dumping 20M of the token in one go Happens all the time in traditional finance Im told Solend put the proposal to a DAO vote Specifically asking members whether they should Enact special margin requirements for large whales that represent over 20 of borrows and grant emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whales account so the liquidation can be executed OTC The vote passes 98 yes But one whale held a majority of the voting power By the way not the same whale that caused this mess Essentially one yes vote decided the outcome On top of that the voting window was only open for 6 hours and the site was down for 3 hours during that window Naturally theres backlash a lot of backlash Then Solend issues a second governance proposal to undo the first proposal revoking their power to take over the whales account They give the vote 24 hours this time It passes with 998 voting yes No surprises there Since then the price of SOL has actually increased This bought the whale and Solend more time The team released a third governance proposal which passed to reduce the borrow limit to 50M and temporarily reduce the max liquidation factor from 20 to 1 And maybe the best news of all the whale has been in contact with Solend and started moving funds and reducing their position Wow that was a lot to take in Its easy to criticize from the outside but in the end this was a bad move Solend put themselves in an uncomfortable position and wanted to resort to traditional methods to undo it Thats not DeFi The team has announced theyre in the clear for now and will be releasing a full post mortem soon We can only hope lessons have been learnt What are xNFTs Lets play charades 1 word 4 letters sounds like KFC You guess it xNFT is the word Wait what WTF is an xNFT The X stands for eXecutable Essentially Coral is turning your wallet into a backpack Backpack is the operating system xNFTs are the apps Rather than connecting your wallet to different protocols those protocols connect to the operating system According to the announcement xNFTs will eventually be crosschain But is this closer to web2 than we think If you have to build an OS is that centralized Well no because protocols are still built on chain and xNFTs interact with them on chain To be honest were still trying to wrap our head around this We thought we understood but its hard to explain without seeing it in action Hopefully well see more details on xNFTs in the next few weeks Magic Eden is now a unicorn Solanas leading NFT marketplace just raised a 130M Series B valuing them at 16B Thats unicorn status And its all happened in just 9 months since they launched When OpenSea announced Solana NFTs were coming to their marketplace most thought it would be the end of Magic Eden Myself included Instead theyve continued to grow and ride the breakout of Solana NFTs Like partnering with Phantom to allow users to list their NFTs directly in wallet They hosted a party on a yacht as part of NFT NYC and it looked lit Do we still say lit Whatever these guys do it feels like they cant miss And check out this crazy story from one of the founders From broke on a boat to unicorn on a yacht Fcking wild Solana goes all in on mobile In the last week SMS started appearing around Solana twitter Like xNFTs everyone was adding SMS to their twitter names and guessing what it could mean Thankfully we didnt have to wait long with the announcement coming yesterday SMS Solana Mobile Stack Its a toolkit for building web3 apps on mobile And if that wasnt big enough Solana is also launching their own smartphone called Saga Its built on top of Android with a Solana dApp store This is massive news and a huge bet from Anatoly and everyone at Solana But if you step back it makes a lot of sense Mobile has become the dominant platform of everyday life for web2 But web3 hasnt embraced mobile yet Do we really think mass adoption will come by expecting everyone to revert back to desktop They say a bear market is the time for building Solana has grabbed the bear by the balls and is building like crazy Maybe it is Solana Summer after all x200B What a week We wish every week was

Health Report August 2022 Validator Health Report August 2022 Source x200B Solana is a public opensource blockchain that anyone in the world can build on Our mandate at the Solana Foundation is to support the decentralization security resilience and adoption of the Solana blockchain We run a range of programs in support of this mission ranging from creating documentation for validators to issuing grants for projects furthering network decentralization We also monitor the health and resilience of the Solana network Our approach to date in commenting on the health of the network has been focused on surfacing data that make it easy for the community to monitor key metrics like validator count or the length of network outages As the network continues to mature and broaden its user base we think its important to provide the Solana ecosystem and broader web3 community with more context on how we think about the health of the network In the coming months the Solana Foundation will release a series of pieces that touch on various components of network health including network performance software and client updates We welcome input and engagement from the community on this series Fill out this form with feedback questions and metrics that youd like to see tracked In this first report well dive into the validator network and key metrics we track to assess its health You can download this report here Validator Health Overview The Solana network is formed by a collection of individuals and entities that choose to run Solana validator software Anyone in the world can view download modify the validator source code and run the software to participate in the operation and security of the network There is no single entity that controls how the network runs or what kinds of applications or services can be built or used on top of the network In this way Solana is permissionless meaning that nobody needs anyones permission to participate develop extend or use the network A growing community of core developers write test and publish a version of the Solana validator software that is free to use for the community of validator operators Today the Solana blockchain consists of over 3400 validators on six different continents The long term success of Solana is dependent on a strong healthy validator network A large diverse set of validator operators are essential to maintain a resilient distributed and credibly neutral network for the world to use There are many ways to assess the health of the validator network Some of the metrics we track include Total Validator Count Every validator independently verifies the current state of the blockchain data and any new transactions that are proposed to the network The total validator count represents the number of separate copies of the current network state that exists on computers all over the world A high validator count indicates greater guarantees of permanently survivable data storage and network function and recovery in the event of a catastrophic event or major data loss Nakamoto Coefficient This metric first coined by Balaji Srinivasan is defined as the minimum number of nodes that must collude or become compromised to stop or selectively alter block production in a network thereby censoring all or part of the network A high Nakamoto Coefficient is desired to ensure a censorshipresistant network meaning any user can be ensured that their usage of the network will never be hampered Distribution A blockchain with many validators and a high Nakamoto Coefficient is still vulnerable to external factors that can influence the functioning of a blockchain Here we look at the role of geography data center ownership and entity control over validators to better understand Solanas resilience in the case of exogenous variables x200B Total Validator Count Blockchains with more validators tend to be more resilient When a user performs a transaction on a blockchain they want to be confident that their transaction will be recorded Ideally each transaction on a blockchain is recorded on every validator on that chain which is why a higher number of validators is important The more times that a transaction is recorded the more confident a user can be that their transaction wont be tampered with There are two types of validators on the Solana network Consensus nodes Consensus nodes are central to the functioning of the network by providing two essential functions creating and proposing new blocks to the rest of the network and voting on the validity of new blocks proposed by other nodes on the network Each block contains many transactions that are submitted by various users and applications on the network Every consensus node independently verifies all new transactions in a proposed block before voting on its validity The more nodes that participate in this consensus process the more confidence a user or third party has that a change to the network or a transaction was verified by a large population x200B RPC nodes Remote Procedure Call nodes are an applications gateway to the Solana infrastructure RPC node operators can offer API indexing or other services to provide a convenient interface for users and applications to the core Solana network These are often commissioned or run by individual applications and are dedicated to that programs particular task rather than maintaining consensus on the blockchain RPC nodes like consensus nodes all independently verify all new blocks and changes to the network A large number of nodes is critical for the health of the network Theres no brightline for how many nodes is enough Whats important is that Users feel confident that their transaction will be recorded no matter what This is why its important to have a large number of copies of the current state available on many nodes and that they exist in a broad distribution across the world The state tracks the latest balance of each wallet updated in real time and always up to date Nodes operate independently of each other A failure of a single node or set of nodes say run by a single entity or in a particular geography should not impact the functioning of the network Users can verify the accuracy of transactions by looking at other nodes If a single node goes down or has an issue recording a transaction users can rely on other nodes to verify the accuracy of the blockchain How Solana is doing x200B The Solana Mainnet Beta network went live in March 2020 Since then its grown into a network of over 3400 validators across six continents including over 1900 consensus nodes1 An average of 95 new consensus nodes and 99 RPC nodes have joined the network every month since June 2021 x200B In the next section well discuss the Solana networks health in terms of its Nakamoto Coefficient Nakamoto Coefficient Users of a blockchain must be confident that any valid transaction they submit will be included in a block and then confirmed through consensus If a group of consensus nodes becomes compromised or acts maliciously in a coordinated manner it can attempt to alter or prevent the network from achieving consensus on new blocks The Nakamoto Coefficient is a common way to measure a blockchains resilience against such behavior The Nakamoto Coefficient is a metric first proposed by Balaji Srinivasan and is defined as the minimum number of nodes that would need to be compromised to alter or stop consensus in a network thereby preventing some or all new blocks and therefore the transactions within them from being confirmed This process is known as censorship and could impact the entire network or some subset of users or applications In proof of stake networks the Nakamoto Coefficient is the minimum number of nodes required to represent at least 334 of voting power Preventing any blockchain from reaching this point is critical for maintaining its usability and keeping it censorship resistant Consider A business or state actor wants to maintain a monopoly over a certain type of app on a chain If they can strike a deal with validators who represent 3334 of the stake on a blockchain they can stop the entire blockchain from accepting transactions from competitive businesses by refusing to vote on blocks containing the censored transactions What Drives Nakamoto Coefficient On Proof of Stake networks such as Solana consensus nodes compete with one another to attract stake which is a mechanism by which people or programs can direct some of their tokens to be associated with a particular validator or validators Different blockchains implement various incentives or strategies to encourage staking While the details differ across blockchains the core principle is the same for most Proof of Stake networks a validators voting weight or voting power is proportional to the amount of stake associated with it Therefore validators which have more stake can have a greater influence on the outcome of the consensus process and block production than validators with less stake As stake is not evenly distributed across all validators this results in the existence of a cohort of the most highly staked validators on the network which collectively represent 33 of the voting power How Solana is doing x200B On Solana the Nakamoto Coefficient is 31 This means the lowest number of validators that would have to collude to censor the network is 31 This number has grown steadily since the chains launch in March 2020 and continues to rise and its growth is a key indicator of the health of the network x200B Weve also included the Nakamoto Coefficient of several other Proof of Stake blockchains for the sake of benchmarking Blockchain2 Coefficient as of 8722 Solana31 Avalanche28 Thorchain27 Binance7 Cosmos7 Osmosis7 Near7 Polygon3 The Nakamoto Coefficient is important but paints an incomplete picture of the resilience of a blockchain A compromise of the Nakamoto Coefficient would impact the blockchains realtime ability to guarantee that new blocks be voted on and added to the chain In the event that the Nakamoto Coefficient is compromised the blockchain could recover by excising the affected validators and restarting consensus without them A successful recovery depends on a large total validator count which is why the first metric in this report is important There are also other exogenous factors that impact the resilience of a blockchain We discuss those in the next and final section Distribution The Nakamoto Coefficient is a critical metric but doesnt capture the human element involved in running a blockchain One of the least appreciated aspects of validator network health is the role of exogenous factors such as geopolitics natural disasters and corporate interests Thats why in this final section we look at the Solana networks resilience in the context of some of these factors and why theyre important Geography A global resilient blockchain has to continue operating no matter the events in a given part of the world Consider A dissident facing retribution from a dictatorial regime has to feel confident she can access funds even if that regime chooses to shut down servers running a chain incountry A natural disaster disrupts all the nodes in a particular region Users of a blockchain in any part of the world still need to feel confident that chain will keep running even when many validators are unexpectedly knocked offline How Solana is doing Heres a snapshot of the geographic distribution of the network organized based on the percentage of stake in each country Weve included the same analysis for Ethereum or the sake of benchmarking organized by the number of miners across geographies x200B Source last updated 8122 x200B Source last updated 72222 Data Center Concentration Anyone can run a Solana node But because Solana requires highly performant hardware validator operators will often rent server space from privately run data centers to run their nodes This is not unusual the majority of the computing power on most blockchains is done on privately owned servers in large data centers The option to rent privately owned servers has made it significantly easier for anyone to run a validator of any blockchain However the risk of using private data centers to run validators means that the owners of data centers have disproportionate power over the functioning of a blockchain Its important that stake on a blockchain is relatively distributed among private companies that rent server space in order to minimize the risk that a single company can compromise a chain Lets take Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure for instance Consider x200B A large company observes that an app competitive to their service is being built on the Solana blockchain That company enters into an agreement with AWS or Azure to halt transactions related to that particular app If Amazon or Azure has sufficient control over the servers running the Solana network they could agree to this deal and effectively shut the competitive app down x200B An app on the Solana blockchain emerges that enables dissidents to easily message or send funds to each other A country could place political pressure on Microsoft or Amazon to halt transactions on that particular app thereby censoring the blockchain x200B How Solana is doing Weve split out the data below based on the Autonomous System Number ASNs of major data centers based on data thats publicly available An Autonomous System AS is a network of servers with a single routing number Different Autonomous Systems are identified by a unique number known as the ASN Depending on how the internal networkingrouting is configured a single ASN could span multiple physical locations in different geographies x200B Source last updated 72222 Stake on Solana is relatively distributed among ASNs with no one autonomous system hosting anything close to 333 of active stake The Solana Foundation continues to monitor this distribution over private data centers and encourages users to continue distributing their stake to a broader set of data centers Validator ownership across entities There are over 19003 blockproducing nodes on the Solana network but that doesnt mean that 1900 separate entities are running each of these nodes Several companies have built businesses off of running multiple validators on multiple chains In many ways this is healthy for blockchains It means that people have a strong business interest in investing in the security and resilience of a chain However its critical that no one entity builds up too much control over the validator network of a chain even if they are running multiple validators How Solana is doing The Solana Foundation has verified that of 1915 consensusproducing validators at least 1688 8814 are run by independent entities updated as of August 1 2022 The remainder may also be independent of each other but the Solana Foundation has not verified this Looking to the future The Solana Foundation is continuously working to improve the health of the validator network by providing tools and education to our global community of validators and stakers In particular we recognize that continuing to encourage broader distribution of stake across data centers and entities is critical to the health of the validator network We will continue to monitor this data and report on it regularly We welcome feedback and questions as we engage with the community Disclaimer The information in this

Is Solana Solana is a blockchain platform designed for running decentralized applications dApps It was founded in 2017 by San Franciscobased Solana Labs Solana is known for much faster transactions it can process and lower transaction fees compared to such blockchains like Ethereum The blockchain has its own currency called Solana SOLUSD and with the ticker symbol SOL which is used to pay transaction fees and for staking It also empowers holders to vote in future upgrades Its also used by developers of nonfungible tokens NFTs dApps and other software projects Fast Facts A fast cryptocurrency that people consider as a potential alternative to Ethereum ETH It hosts over 350 apps on its network A new technology the PoH mechanism made it possible to speed up the transaction time It can process around 50000 transactions per second TPS Special characteristics Solana is designed to guarantee that network usage expenses are less than one cent per transaction with new more than twicepersecond confirmed blocks How is that speed possible The answer is Solanas innovative PoH mechanism that enables operating faster Solana claims that it can host hundreds or thousands of transactions per second at an average price of 000025 per transaction Compared to Bitcoin which can sometimes be really slow and needs about 90 minutes to process and confirm a transaction Ethereum charges relatively high fees The network has some features worth mentioning such as Sealevel Solana allows numerous smart contracts to run at the same time This saves time and makes Solana a costefficient blockchain network Gulfstream system this system replaces memepool needs as Solanas network can manage a memory pool size of 10000 transactions Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance BFT Solana is protected by BFT which ensures that a particular node failure doesnt impact the working of the whole system This algorithm helps the nodes to continue working even after numerous failures Cloudbreak Solana follows a horizontal scaling method enabling it to increase its scalability Cloudbreak organizes a database that can read and write transaction input and its responsible for setting up a connection between hardware and software Pipeline Solana spreads tasks among different hardwares that quickly validate the information blocks Turbine Solana divides blockchain nodes into smaller chunks the main purpose is to increase the transactions speed And as the cherry on the cake a proofofhistory concept PoH ProofofHistory concept PoH Anatoly Yakovenko who is Solanas cofounder published a whitepaper in November 2017 describing the Proof of History PoH concept PoH is proof for verifying order and period of time passed between events and it is used to encrypt trustless passage of time into a ledger Yakovenko pointed out that blockchains that were then publicly available did not rely on time so each node in the network had its own local time zone without relying on any other participants time in the network Due to such flaws there was no guarantee that every other participant in the network would make the exact same choice Proofofhistory provides a cryptographic timestamp that empowers every validator in the network to trace the correct order of transactions or events Thanks to PoH all nodes on the Solana blockchain can agree on the time in the network without communicating and agreeing with each other on what time it is As validators are in charge of their own clock the verification process is reduced It highly improves the speed at which transactions are processed on the Solana network The nodes can agree on the time prior to consensus about the transactions creating a special environment that can manage far more transactions than any other blockchain network From a technical point of view proof of history cant be called a consensus mechanism but it is critical to Solanas speed since it allows its proofofstake blockchain to operate better than other blockchain technologies Staking and validating Solana How to earn money with Solana Thats quite easy you can simply become a validator or a liquidity provider for the Solana network The Validating option asks for high computing power but staking your SOL to provide liquidity to a pool doesnt require transferring or selling your holdings Powerful computing devices with 12core processors 128GB or more of random access memory RAM and 15TB of hard drive space would allow you to validate transactions You can also use a virtual computing device using a cloud platform According to the proofofhistory operating protocol Solana validators use a system of time stamps and cryptographic verification for adding new blocks to the blockchain Validators add blocks at the same time and they are synchronized across the whole Solana network a bit later The Solana blockchain gives its validators voting privileges within the Solana network It is worth mentioning that Solana validators can participate without a minimum SOL balance using the socalled Solana vote account Plus if you have a wallet that can hold SOL and Solanabased tokens such as Phantom Waves or Sollet you can be engaged with different apps there You can also trade one token for another on a decentralized exchange called DEX such as Raydium or buy an NFT on the Solanart marketplace Solana vs Ethereum People often call Solana an Ethereum killer but why Lets compare the two networks briefly Among Solanas strong points are its transaction fees which are low about 0000005 SOL or around 0001 and the transactions themselves are really swift and smooth they are usually confirmed within a minute Solana operates around 50000 TPs compared to Ethereums 15 TPs Despite all the advantages Solana isnt a bed of roses only Solana is still in beta Its quite strange and risky to invest your money or build an app on the platform once the project is in beta version Above all Solana asks its validators to have extremely high computing power The point is that validator nodes arent mighty enough to manage the network activity slowdown processes or cause instability on the platform As for the Ethereum network it is bigger in terms of users and protocols but it has been running since 2015 Ethereum has long been plagued by high fees for transactions which sometimes skyrocket into hundreds or even thousands of dollars especially at times of high network congestion Its evident that there is no obvious winner in this competition of networks The market and people decide which one is going to be the best but both systems can easily coexist Solanas last updates As you probably know Solana has an alternative to ERC 20 tokens Called Solana Program Library SPL Coinbase the USbased crypto exchange plans to allow withdrawals of SPL While Ethereumbased tokens like Shiba Inu SHIB and Binance Coin BNB have circulating market capitalizations of around 10 billion the biggest SPL token by the same metric is Serum SRM at 281 million according to Coinbase data One of the biggest NFTs marketplaces on the Net OpenSea might support Solana NFTs in the near future but its still more like a buzz Some helpful Solana Here are two main tools to track your SOLs Solscan here youll find all your transactions and other transaction histories The second one Solana Beach explores validators transactions blocks and activity on Serum If you are interested in Yakovenkos whitepaper weve mentioned earlier enjoy reading it here NFTs admirers and lovers can definitely enjoy the following websites digital eyes solanartio magic eden and solseaio Once you want to check on Solanas price growth have a look at these illustrative stats and charts that compare different coins and tokens The Coin Perspective CoinMarketCap and Coingecko Closing thoughts Solana made it possible to have the quickest transactions on low fees it introduced a new algorithm called ProofofHistory PoH it made people compare it with such gigantic ecosystems as Cardano Ethereum it has ambitious plans with introducing a Solana Program Library which is opposition for an ERC20 token If everything is going to be alright Solana will have a bright promising future and become a strong player on the market to give people better variety for crypto investing and trading so lets hope it will Source,Positive,0.9987

Intel Raoul Pal founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor Real Vision hosts Anatoly Yakovenko cofounder and CEO of Solana SOL on the Raoul Pal Adventures in Crypto podcast Raoul questions Anatoly about SOLs sudden emergence the upcoming SOL phone and more Anatolys Journey in Crypto Founding SOL Thought what was interesting in 2017 was ETH because of the smart contracts side Saw smart contracts as a way for developers to write new kinds of code which were weird interesting and good at something Speaking about founding SOL he had a eureka moment when he realized that theres a way to generate proofs for time called verifiable delayed functions Anatoly utilized his experience and coworkers from Qualcomm to help build SOL The Blockchain trilemma the idea that between security decentralization and scalability decentralized blockchains can only deliver two of these values at a time only applies if youre exceeding the bandwidth of the network ETH wasnt built to handle much load whereas SOL from the beginning was conceived as an alternative cheap fast and easytouse network This approach makes the nodes more expensive but hardware only gets cheaper as time goes by SOLs Consensus Mechanism PoH Proof of History Learn More about PoH Here Everything in a blockchain network needs to be proof of something and the consensus mechanism that SOL uses is called PoH PoH uses a recursive verifiable delay function which is a chunk of data that when you look at it you can identify how much time was spent in generating it as there are limits on how fast a computer can work The trick is to create a mathematical function that is sequential so that it cannot be parallelized as well as publicly verifiable The data that is generated needs to be verified quicker than the time it takes to generate SOLs implementation of PoH was trivial and it isnt being researched anymore SOL implements SHA256 the hash function that BTC uses and runs it sequentially There is no way to parallelize SHA256 To verify it they checkpointed it every 1000 or 100000 iterations This process happens based on the availability of the cores to verify the data in parallel SOLs Scalability Prospects Initially envisioned a TPS of 710000 at a 1gigabit node and achieved 110th of that At the moment SOL does 500600 TPS based on the application that has been deployed Claims that the cap depends on the hardware thats deployed The testnet is bigger than the mainnet even with the same hardware Have performed tests at 15000 TPS on the testnet Issues With the SOL Chain Anatoly mentioned that the continuous halting of the chain has been their biggest challenge SOL processes 30 million transactions per day unexpected things happen They were shortsighted on the kinds of attacks that people will throw at the network such as botting NFT mints which could result in validators shutting down breaking or running out of memory If this happens to a third of the validators then the network is stalled until manual intervention brings it back up SOLs cheap fees and fast network enable high amounts of spam and bot activity which can congest the chain The turnaround time with fixes is painful for engineers and builders When the Chinese hash power for BTC shut down the network was processing each block in 2 hours if this same thing happens to a fast network like SOL it would be declared dead How Did the SOL Network Grow Never raised a ton of money only had an 1820 month runway When their competitors were raising hundreds of millions of dollars SOL raised 14 million in the summer of 2018 Team did not have the resources to build EVM compatibility or anything that wasnt necessary Had to build their smart contract language and mentioned that devs are naturally curious so that helped They got lucky in that they didnt have enough resources otherwise theyd have built EVM compatibility and ended up competing with ETH L2s and ETH itself Emphasized the time of the launch being earlier to the market than Polkadot and Binance Smart Chain helped Making NFT tools freely available to nontech people to go and mint NFTs helped build community They felt that if they could get Serum a SOL native DEX featuring on chain order books to work then anything would be possible from a tech POV Crypto Mass Adoption Raoul Pal explains that to stay relevant in the space you need to own a part of the space BTC and ETH have done a great job with that He believes that SOL is targeting the mass adoption consumer layer with the applications theyre building the phone and the shop and that is their narrative For mass adoption he believes that noncrypto communities refuse crypto and blockchain tech they have an immune response For example with gaming the industry is slowly and incrementally moving forwards and whenever a major publisher announces support for NFTs most gamers have a negative response A game or NFTs should derive value from consumption and enjoyment to the end user and not just considered an investment The entertainment value is worth the cost of whatever the user is spending in a particular game Questioned how the community can get to 100 million active users signing transactions Were still a ways away from creating a whole experience wherein the end users can for instance store their SOL NFTs and ETH NFTs seamlessly Working on solutions to keep the seed phrase truly safe will also help with increased adoption In terms of Music NFTs as a means for mass adoption Anatoly feels that theres a lot of value for artists and platforms but it is hard to show that value to fans Why the SOL Phone Anatoly brought up the importance of meeting Jason who is the founder of Awesome Privacy which is the OEM building the phone Privacy and Web3 are closely related no Web3 dapp asks for a username and password We need a business model that depends on privacy otherwise well be left holding the privacy that Google and Apple sell us Feels that if we get to the scale of 100 million people in crypto signing transactions there has to be a mobile phone as that is what most people use Working on adding BIP39 helping with seed creation and recovery This will connect directly to the mobile device so when a Web3 dapp loads it wont have to mention which wallets it supports as it will automatically connect based on the seed Working on a Web3 dapp store and crypto payments as well Hopes theres an app that is built that garners widespread attention and then has someone acquire the hardware Based on the specs the phone will be priced at 1000 They want to build a lowerend device next The goal is not to make a generalpurpose device but to make an awesome phone for crypto natives and a great application store for devs What Gets Anatoly Excited in the Crypto Space Fascinated by the Constitution DAO and how quickly people can come together and accumulate capital collectively Crypto eliminates many bottlenecks and enables communities to form with a clear purpose Interestingly he feels that there probably isnt a need for a Web3 version of Discord or Twitter Web3 groups such as DAOs provide enough community by just being in the group where they communicate doesnt matter much About SOL Hacker Houses The community response after the first SOL conference Breakpoint Many devs got together and started building dapps and the team wanted to support that The SOL team organizes these Hacker Houses across the world Around 9000 developers showed up to these events Month over month the amount of funding the SOLbased projects are getting cant be faked Handling the Massive Correction in SOL Price Having seen ETH drop 70 as they started building SOL at the end of the last bull cycle made it digestible this recent drop digestible This summary was

Energy Use Report September 2022 Source Blog Post In 2021 the Solana Foundation began tracking the carbon footprint of the Solana blockchain and enlisted outside expertise to conduct an independent assessment of the chains emissions Today the Solana Foundation is releasing the third edition of the energy impact report The networks overall emissions rose roughly 26 percent during the past six months driven by overall growth in the validator network and the addition of hardware production ewaste emissions in the analysis The highlights for this report include The assessment of the overall carbon footprint of the network is 3412 tonne CO2 per year up 26 percent from 2707 tonne CO2 per year in March 2022 The overall carbon footprint is measured by adding emissions due to power consumption 1772 tonne CO2 per year and emissions due to hardware production also known as ewaste 1639 tonne CO2 per year x200B The primary drivers of emissions estimate changes are The incorporation of emissions due to hardware production ewaste into the energy use report which added 1639 tonne CO2 per year Decreased emissions as a result of a reduction in the estimated power consumption per validator node which fell 48 percent from 984W to 509W per validator node Improved accuracy due to the inclusion of data centerspecific renewable energy utilization which lowered average network carbon intensity roughly ten percent from 198 to 180 gCO2 per KWh All the data and analysis in this report is being uploaded to Github to further improve its accessibility and so that others can use and build on this dataset While there are always improvements to be made when it comes to emissions reduction its important to note that Solana remains an incredibly energy efficient blockchain and that the network is carbon neutral due through the Foundations purchase of offsets This analysis found that running the entire Solana network for an hour uses less energy than a single Bitcoin transaction Many of the updates since the last energy report are driven by steps the Foundation has taken to be more comprehensive and precise in its emissions accounting Since the outset of the Solana climate report we have erred on the side of overestimating the networks energy footprint with the intention to hone the assessment over time as our methodology improves The updates in this latest energy report are largely reflective of those improvements in methodology These changes include Broadening the scope of emissions measured The report now includes estimates for emissions due to ewaste incorporating the carbon footprint of the production of validator hardware Updating validator hardware requirements Previous reports measured emissions from baseline validator hardware that is more powerful than what is now required to run a Solana node Accordingly the estimate of energy consumption per validator node was revised down to 509 W from 984 W in prior reports Breaking out the carbon footprint of voting vs nonvoting transactions A key takeaway from previous energy use reports is that a single transaction on Solana uses roughly the energy equivalent of 3 Google searches Upon further digging into our dataset we uncovered that a single nonvoting transaction on Solana is the energy equivalent of 3 Google searches However the average transaction on Solana including both voting and nonvoting transactions uses the energy equivalent of approximately half a Google search We will continue to look for opportunities to refine and improve this analysis over time Additionally the Foundation is tracking the release of several new features that we expect to make the network more energy efficient These include Compressed NFTs The release of compressed NFTs will make it possible to mint 8 to 10 NFTs in a single transaction drastically reducing the energy consumption per mint Doubling of Transaction Size This will significantly increase the perblock efficiency of the chain and enable the network to accomplish more in a single transaction for a minimal increase in computing power While this release wont directly impact emissions per transaction it will improve throughput of the network and require less computing power to be used for a given set of transactions Importantly we invite the community to check our work and to continue to build on these analyses Thats why the Solana Foundation is publishing the data used to develop the energy use report on Github Over time well continue to make this data more accessible and useable This is a novel dataset and analysis was built by Othersphere an expert firm led by Robert Murphy that the Foundation enlisted to conduct this independent carbon assessment Data like this is often hard to come by many emissionsrelated datasets are only available behind paywalls if at all From the outset this analysis was designed to be open and improved by community engagement and enhancing visibility and access by posting in Github is the latest step in this effort Its our hope at the Foundation that by publishing this data on Github in collaboration with Othersphere others can build on this work and apply this data set to other use cases We encourage others to dig into this data and use it as a jumping off point for other analyses whether specific to the Solana network or to blockchain more broadly x200B The Solana Foundation will continue to release periodic reports on the Solana networks energy usage and take steps to minimize the ecosystems environmental impact,Positive,0.9981

interview with some of the Solana Summercamp hackathon winners but unfortunately our team decided not to publish it in the blog because of the high volume of different materials being published now Interviews will be published on everstakes twitter one by one soon in a bit different form and also on Janes page with maybe some short videodemonstrations of UIUX where its possible Stay tuned x200B List of the winners who participated in our miniinterview Dual Finance Solana SummerCamp DeFi Track 1st place automated risk management of structured products via gamma scalping on Mango Markets Tensor Trade Solana SummerCamp DeFi Track 2nd place A high performance NFT marketplace that provides pro traders advanced features DreamOS Solana SummerCamp Gaming Track 4th place It turns web3 into an extension of your Mac or PC which enables users to manage gaming and other assets across dApps Monstr Solana SummerCamp Payments Track 5th placeEnables easy access to crypto payments via NFT gift cards Better Call Sol Solana SummerCamp Web3 Track 5th place the missing Solana client The100 Solana SummerCamp Web3 Track 3rd place a TV channel system built on Solana CandyPay Solana SummerCamp

4th place a decentralized mobile chat app and chrome extension allowing easy secure communication between members of DAOs SolStamps Solana SummerCamp University Award software designed to solve email phishing by linking user identities to Solana wallets CINI Next Generation Film Camera Solana SummerCamp Mobile Track 2nd place A next generation film camera ready to revolutionize the photo space with a capture and earn model Thanks to all of the participants you guys are awesome x200B Our questions were 1 How expected was the win for you turned out only 2 participants actually expected to win 2 Tell us a little bit about your team something interesting beyond what youve already mentioned in your presentation or project description 3 What brought you to the Solana Ecosystem 4 How will your project enrich Solana ecosystem and make it better 5 What have you got from the hackathon aside from the prize money and possible future fame and success 6 How was it launching a project in a bear market spoiler builder are not scared of bears 7 What are you most excited about now after winning 8 Which projects of other hackathon participants impressed you fun fact Ora Labs was mentioned 5 times in the answers Interview x200B 1 Lets get to the interview right away How expected was the win for you Dual Finance A definite shocker We had practically forgotten we made a submission because weve been so busy building the project out further Tensor Trade We actually participated in both Solana Riptide Solana Summer Camp Riptide where we won 3rd for an NFT pricing oracle we worked on before pivoting to Tensor Trade Going into Summer Camp we knew that it was going to be much more competitive 60 more participants and knew our chances were slim in general We were overjoyed when we found out that 1 we won 2nd in a category and 2 it was in DeFi were the FTX for NFT trading We knew we had something with Tensor Trade based on the traction weve observed since our public launch but winning something at Solana Summer Camp was further validation that we built something people loved DreamOS Actually rather unexpected as we originally applied for the Web3 track but ended up winning in the gaming track Monstr We did not quite expect it We did the best we could and received tons of help and feedback from the IRL hackathon location in Singapore Better Call Sol We saw some traction online but we were realistic about our odds since our track alone had over 400 submissions It sure was a pleasant surprise though The100 We heard people were enjoying the demo and thought it was cool but honestly winning was still a surprise Sometimes you never know where youll get signal and what will click with people CandyPay We have been working hard for the last 2 months building to power mobile native NFT and Payment experiences on Solana which is the current need for ecosystem users Being power mobile users ourselves the UX is unbearable and we thought it is a problem worth solving Fast forward we have been used at multiple IRL sites across the world with people loving the seamless feel so we had great expectations to win a prize for sure Fun Fact CandyPay might be the only project which not only submitted for this Hackathon but also got used at 5 IRL Summercamp sites where our fellow builders minted those proof of attendance gasless NFTs Lulo We had high hopes but certainly not any expectation for a win Dao Chat Not expected at all we were too busy worrying on whether Dao Chat would be found valuable by the community yet alone the judges SolStamps From the moment we came up with the SolStamps concept and by the time we built a working Proof of Concept our team was fairly confident there was a good chance of being on the potential win radar All the while we were shocked and honored to win the University Award Prize CINI Next Generation Film Camera It was totally unexpected While we were confident that CINI will reinvent the photo NFT space but didnt yet have a clue about its market acceptance Its amazing feedback for CINI to be recognized by the Solana Foundation within a pool of talented teams and projects from the Summer Camp Hackathon x200B x200B 2 Tell us a little bit about your team how could we miss this question something interesting beyond what youve already mentioned in your presentation or project description Maybe some fun facts or your hidden talents My personal favourite question Dual Finance The founders met playing lacrosse at MIT Tensor Trade We Ilja and I were complete strangers living on opposite sides of the world 6 months ago We both found each other through YCs cofounder matching portal struck it off with our first trial project Tensor NFT oracle and the rest is history DreamOS Were the Dream Team We have a very young team Im the oldest person on our team at 28 my two cofounders are 22 and 18 We arent like other startups we dont have deep industry experience in our sector we just have a really good idea and a dream We also actually care about our users We arent obsessed with extracting value I just want to build the tools that blockchain users have been LACKING for so long for whatever reason Web3 has a massive UX problem and yet we have more devs building coin flip games on Solana than working on UX Its mind boggling Monstr CM the cofounder of Monstr is an animal lover We initially started as an animalcentric NFT project to fundraise for the local Animal Welfare Groups and also raise awareness for animal protection There were people in the local community who wanted to support us but found onboarding too much of friction So we decided to join the hackathon to solve this particular pain point Better Call Sol Lab Eleven is a team of Australian web3 engineers split between Melbourne and Sydney Weve known each other through our past careers where we built some pretty complex solutions for a diverse set of clients Were now bringing all that experience and focusing it on Solana Well be at Breakpoint so come say hi or just stare from a distance whatever is your speed Our Jane will be there too btw the100 Were a team of creatives who love art and tech For whatever reason there seems to be a lot of this type in Solana if youre one of them come join us CandyPay We are a team of young builders who love building cool projects instead of studying in school xD Fun fact here will be we all are under 18 yrs and havent passed the legal age yet some just finished high school and others have entered recently So its a roller coaster ride of handling school exams building bugs and stuff Time management and keeping production up and running were the hardest part as there might have been some server issues cause of excess usage and our backend friend might be in school to handle them so we all kept learning new things every day to keep the ship running We have certainly grown out of that stage and have learned a lot more than any school or job could teach us in this short timeframe Lulo Lulo was inspired at the Miami Hacker House Dao Chat The team was made up of two students Bruno and Nick however it doesnt feel right saying it was just us two because we couldnt have built Dao Chat if it werent for many other Solana devs giving us advice ideas and technical help A fun fact is that weve been playing on the same football team for the past 6 years SolStamps James is a professional fly fisherman and was on the National United States Youth Fly Fishing Team Ryan is highly talented at the exquisite art of jumping jacks CINI Next Generation Film Camera In the initial dApp demo Dan recorded CINIs captureanddevelop flow to show the team internally While there were no issues with the demo itself however since it captured the chaotic state of his room the team in unison refused to use that version Now it wouldnt have been a good idea to show the world would it In the spirit of web3 our team is fully remote We had teammates based in Berlin Vancouver and Taipei during the hackathon Working with time zones across three continents was definitely a challenge x200B x200B 3 What brought you to the Solana Ecosystem Dual Finance Cheap rent fast transactions with full onchain CLOBs like Serum Mango Markets to build atop Also a sense that Solana token projects were in the greatest need of better token incentive structures Tensor Trade 1 How cheap it was to experiment and send transactions directly to mainnet and 2 the compelling compute model and 3 using Rust Most of these are technological reasons but this matters a ton when youre trying to build a lowlatency realtime NFT trading platform where realtime actually matters when finality is sub 1second DreamOS NFTs Bored Apes had just minted a couple months prior and everyone was getting into NFTs The first NFT I ever purchased was a Solarian and the first NFT I ever minted was a Degenerate Ape Academy So I spent the better part of a year just minting and flipping NFTs looking back it feels like a massive waste of time But super grateful to be here to meet the people I did in NFTs and now to be building tools for NFTs Monstr The awesome community and developer tooling available Transaction fees are also very low Better Call Sol We wrote a whole blog about this But lets face it people rather skim a twitter thread so here you go The100 Im most excited by the idea of blockchain as code legos an entirely new way to build software that harnesses the internets hive mind Solana with its high speed and monolithic blockchain seems best suited towards this endeavor CandyPay Superteam DAO and the ample opportunities Solana has brought for young builders were the forces that attracted us to the Solana Ecosystem Lulo Low fees High throughput its fun building in an environment like that Dao Chat The first line of Web3 code I wrote was for the Solana blockchain by chance due to a random tutorial I had watched but since then I still havent found a single reason or need to leave the ecosystem or join a new one SolStamps Good question Upon framing a proposed idea for SolStamps we quickly realized that our software would require a blockchain to support its ability to drive a massive number of transactions in a timely manner The reputation of the Solana Ecosystem is scalability and speed a perfect match for a highvolume service such as email Furthermore from a monetization outlook unlike other chains with enormous gas fees the 00025 average cost per transaction allows us to offer our service at a reasonable price while maintaining a considerable margin CINI Next Generation Film Camera The Solana ecosystem is the optimal fit for CINI due to its impressive track record with the playtoearn model and NFTs On top of that with the launch of Saga the first dapp native phone it would create a seamless user experience x200B x200B 4 How will your project enrich Solana ecosystem and make it better Dual Finance Providing sustainable aligned incentive structures for other token projects Goodbye inflationary rewards Hello Staking Options Tensor Trade We want to make NFTs as liquid as Dogecoin and we think we can do it by providing a better trading experience to traders who are used to subsecond realtime DeFi trading We are working on a number of new primitives protocols that will hopefully make NFTs 100x more liquid For example we launched TensorSwap the fastest NFT AMM on Solana just a few weeks after we wrapped up Tensor Trade DreamOS Well the problem currently is that Solana is for the lack of a better phrase homeless Or if you prefer Solana lives in a cardboard box named Phantom And that box is small and only has 1 room What were doing is were building a Home for web3 with endless rooms for all your different web3 activities such as marketplaces DeFi NFT organization Ive been on Solana for over a year now and we still dont have tools to even VIEW your NFTs most people still go to Magic Eden to look at their NFTs and portfolio value this is kind of like going to the grocery store to see what food you have in your fridge So were building all the tools that will make using crypto as easy as using your desktop computer or accessing your bank account from your home Monstr We will make it easy for people to get from zero to one onto Solana with very little friction Our hero product the USDC Gift Cards will redefine remittance crypto commerce as well accessibility to DeFi Better Call Sol Better Call Sol was created to better the Solana development experience and provide a more interactive way of educating users on how to use the chain It was created as a public good and was opensourced right away Lowering the barrier to entry for developers is huge step in ecosystem adoption Next time you just want to run a quick adhoc transaction against the chain remember to Better Call Sol the100 Were aiming to build a product that is engaging but also incredibly simple that reaches users who dont know how to use crypto And then if those users want to go deeper and say become a channel owner then theyll need to learn how it all works which is great for the ecosystem CandyPay Mobile native web3 experiences are still very early and unbearable for users Solana has been working on this direction with Saga Phone and we are here to double down on this movement Our mission is to serve Solana Ecosystem users in a way they feel familiar with and convenient while using solana in their everyday life When they Mint NFTs the experience should be smooth and fast without relying on desktops all the time and thats what we have achieved using QR Codes and Tap to Mint user flows In the coming time we are launching our first Payment product and it will change how people currently transact with Cryptocurrencies Built on Solana Pay we will be powering a 1Click Tap to Pay payment experience which will be on par with GPay and Apple pay tailored for web3 users and merchants it will be a seamless fast costefficient method to pay and merchants can reach a global audience while earning more compared to traditional payment rails This will set a new standard for payments in web3 and we ought to make Solana the best usercentric chain with CandyPay powering creators with the best nocode lowcode solutions This way we feel in the coming time CandyPay will hold a special place in users hearts and will have a great impact on Solana Ecosystem as a whole Lulo Toly has been pretty vocal about rebuilding DeFi using order books We aim to become the lendingborrowing component of that rebuild Dao Chat Dao Chat isnt meant to work alone as we describe it in our video it is more of a missing puzzle piece and tool which will add to the decentralisation and independence of DAOs SolStamps Every user of SolStamps interacts with the Solana Blockchain Even though SolStamps is a blockchainbased company we are not targeting the Web3 community We created our software for anyone looking to secure their email bankers lawyers financial advisors escrow agents psychologists and even the average internet user Designing our product in this way directly connects people who would likely never interact with Web3 to the Solana blockchain The consequence were spreading the reach of the Solana platform and the security offered to an entirely new demographic of users CINI Next Generation Film Camera Web3 adoption still faces many challenges especially with noncrypto users Solana is one of the fastestgrowing ecosystems within web3 however its current infrastructure and applications are not friendly to the average mom and pop Take StepN for example they are one of the first protocols that created such massive waves outside of the web3 space and users This is what we aim to achieve with CINI to make it more accessible for everyday users before being a captureandearn product x200B x200B 5 What have you got from the hackathon aside from the prize money and possible future fame and success Dual Finance Acknowledgement that what were building is worthwhile momentum on our fund raise Tensor Trade We were able to connect with a number of other projects in this space including you guys thanks Looking forward to meeting more hackathon winners in the coming days DreamOS We actually havent received our prize money yet We did get reached out to by several VCs Monstr Connections to the Solana Foundation and access to knowledgeable and talented engineers and founders Better Call Sol Working on an idea from inception to execution in a short period of time is exhilarating Winning the prize also validates our thinking and motivates us to push our project further It has been great to be able to show the ecosystem what we are capable of the100 Ive met some great people Ive been reading Packy McCormicks awesome newsletter Not Boring for quite some time and had the opportunity to pitch to him really cool CandyPay In the initial days when we used to approach projects for a potential partnership most of them used to think of us as a scam or fake promise as we didnt have much social credibility and the promise of completely removing connect wallet from users life and powering a Tap to Mint seamless user experience was a big shift and most didnt actually understood it well This hackathon win gave us what we needed the most Social Credibility and a clear sign that not only Mobile native UX is the need of the hour but our execution is also going in the right direction to serve the users Lulo Credibility is probably the most valuable thing Weve had a lot more inbound interest for partnerships due to the hackathon Dao Chat Above everything motivation is what we received backed by confidence and these are the most valuable assets a developer can have SolStamps First and foremost the competition validated the idea of a Web3centric identitybased cybersecurity software Since validating the authenticity of an email using digital identities is a relatively new concept we found it reassuring to be credited by these esteemed judges Second the victory is a validation of our idea that should help in our fundraising efforts CINI Next Generation Film Camera Coming up with the idea for CINI would not have happened without the hackathon We thought it would be a fun experience to join one on a global scale After several brainstorming sessions we came up with the idea for CINI which we were all excited about Plus nothing beats the high and momentum of completing a project from start to finish There were so many times during the hackathon when we were unsure if we would make it to the finish line Its also been great to connect with talented people within the industry to learn more about all things on how to build a product x200B x200B 6 How was it launching a project in a bear market Dual Finance Great environment to build the right way We dont need to rush to production or try to over market the products The people still around today get the value proposition Tensor Trade Launching an MVPearly stage project in a bear market is the best thing you can do Theres 10x less noise and hype that frankly dilutes projects that are actually pursuing something of substance In a bear market you know if your product has traction or if its just riding on momentary hype that will fade away over time DreamOS Stressful we are launching an NFT called breadheads ahead of the official DreamOS rollout and when the bear market hit the activity got so low on twitter and discord it was pretty discouraging But it was a good lesson and it was an exercise in discipline if you can keep your head down and ignore the noise or lack of noise and focus on the problem youre solving and keep building despite negativity all around you then you are going to make it Monstr To us it does not matter as we are building infrastructure that is useful in a bear or bull market Better Call Sol Bear market is a great time to build There are a lot less distractions and we can get down to building some great products the100 Im fortunate to be able to bootstrap Garden Labs with my creative agency Blanc so I mostly can ignore the crazy swings of the market CandyPay It was tough to be true cause there were not many projects launching in bear markets and most of them pushed their launch date and those who launched simply disagreed to use our minting meta as it was too new for users and they didnt want to do something creative I feel our initial reach outs were simply not the right projects who were too conservative but things have changed for the better recently Lulo Its been a grindbut thats what the bear market is forbuilding Dao Chat It perhaps took some pressure off our backs and really filtered out the true community teamplayers from others only looking for quick returns SolStamps Thankfully the broader economic bear market and the crypto downturn had a negligible impact on SolStamps For the competition we were able to selffund the project More notably our software relies on people using email which is essentially uncorrelated to economic conditions CINI Next Generation Film Camera As we all know the bear market is the best time to get BUIDLing One of the biggest challenges with developing a web3 product is separating speculators from true fans A bear market takes away the speculation and promotes reasonable expectations for web3 products This is the ideal time to focus on building up solid products for users x200B x200B 7 What are you most excited about now after winning Dual Finance Growing the reach of the project continuing to build out our roadmap towards the DUAL token launch Tensor Trade Were still fully headsdown building and working our next big product TensorSwap If youre looking to trade NFTs with super low fees 1 total 09 goes back to creators and want to liquidity farm your NFTs come check out TensorSwap DreamOS Its onto the next hackathon for us were going to be in Chicago for the xHack Hackathon then we are going to Lisbon for Breakpoint You should definitely meat our Jane there but Im most excited for after all of that to move to New York and get our new office set up our team is mostly remote right now but we will be convening in NY after Breakpoint Monstr Getting the first users Better Call Sol Even before winning the prize we were keen to continue this project expanding its scope and adding more functionalities That has not changed if anything now we are even more motivated The tool is still in Alpha and plenty of potential to be explored the100 Hopefully raising some funds to help us move faster And continuing to meet people excited about the project that want to get involved whether thats as a creator a user or just to lurk on the Discord CandyPay After winning the hackathon we are much more energetic motivated and excited to push our mission of powering best ever Payments experiences in the Solana Ecosystem We will keep scaling our NFT initiatives and have direct collaborations with launchpads and Marketplaces to serve a whole new UX to mobile native users Meanwhile a great focus will be on launching our firstever payment product which will allow any online business ecom store or sass service already accepting credit cards to accept Solana and USDC in a seamless low code way with this users can pay in usdcsol in a 1click Tap to Pay seamless user experience which gonna set a new standard of onchain payments and we will change commerce on web3 forever D Lulo Getting back to work talking with other teams about their roadmaps and where we can align Dao Chat Collaborating with other teams and amplifying our voices to other projects SolStamps In the next couple of months were beyond excited to release SolStamps V10 to the public and start scaling the user base As we intend to make blockchains decentralized immutable and trustless attributes accessible to any Web2 user we redesigned the software to eliminate the more technical features included in the proof of concept such as knowing how to set up and fund a Phantom wallet Now with V10 users can reap the benefits of the Solana blockchain without ever needing to send or receive crypto By eliminating the need for the Phantom Wallet only one download is necessary to send emails securely We are also thrilled to begin a preseed round of financing to enable the launch of an app that will be compatible with all email services browsers and devices CINI Next Generation Film Camera It was overwhelming to receive messages in support of CINI and their anticipation for the beta test Were rolling full steam ahead to get the promised MVP ready for beta test ASAP x200B x200B 8 Which projects of other hackathon participants impressed you Dual Finance Excited to see what comes from our fellow Gaming Mobile track winners We see these as major growth areas to onboard more users to Solana who we wish to support by being the projects incentive liquidity infrastructure provider Tensor Trade Ora Labs is working on something that is sorely needed on Solana would be quite excited to see their first MVP and take it for a spin Our friends at Lulo Finance are also working on a much more marketefficient order book model for loans keep an eye out for them DreamOS Ora Labs was an impressive project the blockchain search engine was a feature that we had dreamed of for DreamOS very excited to work with their team on integrating their search engine into DreamOS Monstr Ora Labs for sure Concept is unique and will make Solana Blockchain Data more accessible and easier to understand Better Call Sol I cant speak for our whole team but personally as a developer I am most interested in the developer tooling you probably could have guessed from our hackathon submission The judges seem to be aligned on this interest as we saw the grand prize go to IronForge Along the same lines I think Seahorse the Python framework for writing Solana programs will unlock a whole new block of developers and thats exciting to see the100 Theres this project called Titlepool where theyre basically trying to fix the film distribution industry with blockchain its a great project They also own Channel 4 on the100 and are streaming a huge catalog of awesome indie film content Lulo Sooooo many of them We are friends with the IronForge Ora Tensor PoolProps folks so it was good to see they got recognition as well SolStamps While our team is wildly impressed by the innovation of the winning projects and the development they bring to the Solana ecosystem and Web3 in general the project we are most enthusiastic about is Ora the first search engine for blockchain data The ability to fix a preeminent issue as complex as retrieving chainbased data in a userfriendly way is fantastic The variety of filter and search options in the Ora Transaction Viewer makes for a very palatable and informative search query CINI Next Generation Film Camera The grand champion IronForge Its always exciting to see dev tools to create an easier and seamless development experience and lower the barrier to developing on Solana,Positive,1.0

Performance Report October 2022 Network Performance Report October 2022 Source Blog Post Solana is a public opensource blockchain that anyone in the world can build on and run The mandate of the Solana Foundation is to support the decentralization security resilience and adoption of the Solana blockchain The Foundation supports this mission through various programs and initiatives ranging from creating documentation for validators to issuing grants for projects that further network decentralization As the Solana network matures and broadens its user base its important that the Solana Foundation and greater web3 community understand the state of the network where its going and key metrics to track in monitoring its progress The goal has always been to create a lowcost accessible and efficient global state machine Anyone on the network should be able to access the latest information its state at the same time as everyone else and the only barrier to entry should be an internet connection This is an ambitious goal and while the network and community of builders have come a long way there is still work to do This report the first of a regular series is a deep dive into the networks performance Its an opportunity to reflect on how the network has progressed over the past six months examine where its failed and identify key metrics that provide a holistic perspective on the networks current performance This report is part of a broader series of research on the Solana network that includes the validator health report and energy use report The Solana Foundation welcomes input from the Solana community on this report Fill out this form with questions feedback and metrics that youd like to see tracked Network highlights since March 2022 Announcement of Firedancer an alternative open source validator client In August Jump Crypto announced their intent to build a new opensource validator implementation for Solana This would be the second opensource validator client for the Solana blockchain a major step towards furthering the reliability and throughput of the network Testnet reaches 24000 transactions per second Testnet reached its highest transaction throughput to date on September 22 2022 eclipsing 24000 transactions per second While testnet load is not an exact copy of Mainnetbetas load it is a leading indicator for Mainnetbetas progress This is a significant step for the performance of the network QUIC rollout to Mainnetbeta Solanas transaction ingestion protocol is being reimplemented on top of QUIC a protocol built by Google designed for fast asynchronous communication This is an improvement on top of the existing UDPbased protocol which does not have sessions and flow control built in QUIC is currently live on testnet and mainnetbeta However Mainnetbeta still supports both UDP and QUIC QUIC is planned to be the default transaction ingest and forwarding protocol on Mainnetbeta in the 1134 release Once QUIC is adopted there will be additional options available to optimize data ingestion and discourage abusive behavior Learn more in this tech talk by Anatoly Yakovenko on QUIC Surpassing 2000 blockproducing validators In August 2022 the network surpassed 2000 active blockproducing validators on mainnetbeta a notable milestone in the health of the validator network and the evolution of the blockchain This is one of the largest number of validators for a Proof of Stake network and represents 4x growth in validator count from August 30 2021 when 495 blockproducing validators were online See below for comparison Network challenges since March 2022 The Solana network experienced three outages since March 2022 No user funds were lost in any of these incidents Below we review the outages and what is being done to address them September 2022 Outage On September 30 Mainnetbeta stopped producing blocks for 6 hours and 19 minutes when the network was unable to recover from a fork caused by a bug in the consensus algorithm implementation This led to a validator producing duplicate blocks for its leader slots The bug was and patched Read the full outage report June 2022 Outage On June 1 the Mainnetbeta cluster ceased producing blocks for approximately 4 and a half hours This was a result of stalled consensus caused by a bug in the durable nonce transactions feature Releases v1928v11023 included an update designed to prevent the network from halting if the same situation were to arise again Read the full outage report April 2022 outage On April 30 Solanas mainnet beta cluster suffered a 7 hour outage caused by stalled consensus after an enormous amount of inbound transactions 6 million per second flooded the network Evidence suggested that bots programmatically tried to win a new NFT being minted Read the full outage report Several proposed network upgrades have been implemented or are being rolled out to address the causes of this outage specifically the implementation of QUIC fee markets and stakeweighted Quality of Service QoS Upcoming initiatives Solana core developers have been working on a number of new network upgrades aimed at strengthening the network in the face of massive user growth and adoption Follow the status of these upgrades QUIC QUIC is live on most validators and RPC nodes in Mainnetbeta However Mainnetbeta still supports both UDP and QUIC for transaction ingest QUIC is planned to be the default transaction ingest and forwarding protocol on Mainnetbeta starting with the 1134 validator client release Follow its progress on Github The Solana network previously used a UDPbased protocol to pass transactions between RPC nodes and the current block leader UDP lacks flow control and receipt acknowledgments so it doesnt provide a meaningful way to discourage or mitigate abusive behavior To address this Solanas transaction ingestion protocol is being implemented on top of QUIC a protocol that includes sessions and flow control Stakeweighted QualityofService QoS This was built in parallel with QUIC and enabled before QUIC was adopted on Mainetbeta Follow its progress on Github Currently block producers accept transactions without regard for the transactions source Solana is a Proof of Stake network and stakeweighted QoS extends the utility of stakeweighting to transaction quality Under this model a node with 5 stake will have the right to transmit at least 5 of packets to the leader Transactions submitted by validators that have stake in the network will always be received by the block producer regardless of the amount of traffic coming in from nodes without stake Fee Markets Fee markets have been partially introduced and are expected to be further implemented after QUIC is fully adopted Follow its progress on Github The first piece of Fee Market implementation is support for Priority Fees Previously the network processed transactions on a firstcomefirstserved basis which didnt leave users with any way to express the urgency of a transactions execution Priority Fees change this by offering users the ability to specify an additional fee at their discretion to be collected upon the execution of a transaction and its inclusion in a block Priority Fees are calculated based on the amount of computing resources that a transaction is expected to require For example a simple token transfer would require a lower total Priority Fee than an NFT mint that expresses the same level of urgency Priority Fees have been live on Mainnetbteta since July 2022 Future releases will add additional functionality to Fee Markets These include new RPC methods that will help users and apps determine the minimum additional fee required to be likely included in the next block higher fees for highly contested accounts and improvements to block scheduling These pending improvements are expected to create a more efficient Fee Market for all Solana participants Overview of network performance In order for a billion people to use and take advantage of the benefits of the Solana network users need to feel confident that they can use the network any time it will give them accurate information it will be fast and that their funds will be safe Below are a few of the metrics that the Foundation tracks to see how well the network is measuring up to this goal While a variety of metrics may help illustrate the networks performance we highlight four for the sake of simplicity and to allow users to easily track these metrics and how they progress over time Weve included these metrics as well a few others on a Dune dashboard that makes it easy to dig a layer deeper into the data or run your own analyses Uptime The Solana and broader web3 community have raised important questions about the reliability of the network given outages in the second half of 2021 and first half of 2022 A constantly reliable network is foundational to the trust and continued growth of the network One of the most important measures of reliability is network uptime Below we snapshot the networks monthly uptime measured as the percentage of uptime in a given month over the past 6 months Average monthly uptime Source Ratio of voting to nonvoting transactions Voting transactions are necessary for the functioning of the network a vote transaction happens when a validator votes to confirm one or more proposed blocks Nonvoting transactions are the ones triggered by user behavior on the blockchain For example a nonvoting transaction might represent an NFT mint or a user transferring tokens from one wallet to another A certain number of voting transactions are required for the network to reach consensus but over time we would expect to see the ratio of voting to nonvoting transactions go down because the overall percentage of voting transactions should drop as the network gets more efficient Below is a look at voting to nonvoting transactions over time Block time time to produce a block Block time measures the speed of a single transaction since it measures how quickly the network adds more blocks to the blockchain In this chart we see the average time to produce a block how consistent this metric is and how it changes over time Average and maximum transactions per second Total transactions per second are the most accurate reflection of the current throughput of the network and demonstrate its potential and growth over time The benchmark throughput is 65000 transactions per second based on simple transactions like sending money from one place to another Actual transactions per second will differ due to the varied mix of complex transactions on the network and based on demand at any given moment An NFT purchase for example is much more complex than a simple movement of tokens across wallets The chart below is the best snapshot we have of how well the network is performing in real time Its segmented into average transactions per second on a given day along with maximum transactions per second that the network has ever hit at that point in time Average transactions per second have been increasing since June Its important to note that actual network transactions per second is not a reflection of network capacity but of demand for transaction throughput In almost all cases Mainnetbeta is operating below capacity Average transactions per second Max transactions per second As major proposed upgrades are rolled out the Solana Foundation will update the community on its progress on the upgrades page The Solana Foundation will continue to monitor the performance of the Solana network and use reports like this one to help the community track its development over time,Positive,0.9929

looking forward to Hey yall Im a validator on the network Overclock validator team and a mod on the Solana Tech discord as well as here Im very optimistic about Solanas ongoing performance improvements which heavily contrasts with the bearish static and pervading views regarding Solanas reliability that a lot of people might have People dont seem to understand that technology can improve and that Solana definitely has improved over the course of the past year That doesnt excuse past outages which were definitely painful but I think we have much to be optimistic about and Im curious about your thoughts around how to flip this bearish perception around more quickly assuming chain performance remains good If you have any ideas around the type of PR information etc you would want to see to help make you more confident in the reliability of the network it would be great to hear your feedback The issue I see is that people will continue to echo in social media that the chain goes down all the time even if that might not be the case after quite some time Im wondering how we can silence the echo in the future Anyway I also summarized some things below which I see as positives things to look forward to Some recent positives 1 In the last few weeks the network performed exceptionally well when Hetzner turned off 20 of the stakeweight on the network and over half the validator servers This was the largest server provider on the network and the fact that the network passed this obstacle without much of a blip is a good testament to the networks robustness regarding this risk Confirmation times were steady at around 2 seconds A positive of this is that Hetzner shutting things down will also lead to further server provider decentralization I presume 2 Last week was the worst volatility we have seen since Covid hit and the chain performed relatively well if this had happened earlier this year Im confident that the chain would have crashed under that level of load There were some reports that oracles were going stale but it seems that occurred due to oracles not adding priority fees to their transactions when there was a lot of competition around that local state due to MEV transactions being heavy during the volatility Confirmation times for transfers and such increased a bit as well for a while when I was checking the baseline increased to about 6 seconds for the most part Anyway there are things to improve here but the chain performed much better than in the past and didnt go down nor was unusable 3 We are nearly fully transitioned to Quic network protocol now UDP spamming of validators was the main route by which the network was getting hammered with spam up to 100gbsecond in the past and Quic offers much better protection against IP spoofing and offers more congestion control methods There is still work to be done with Quic but UDP is nearly fully turned off reducing spamddos attack vectors Here are some things Im looking forward to 1 Priority fees being included in wallet UIs and more predictability regarding when theyre needed and what fees are required for inclusion Solana is trying to optimize for increased parallelism and local fee markets rather than global so the ideal case is that wallets can differentially track the priority fees needed for different types of transactions some accountsstate might be more in demand and require higher fees than other things 2 Improved throughput There are a few different algorithms that have been developed by Jito Labs and Solana Labs to improve the amount of parallelism happening during block packing when a leader validator builds a block from transactions and replay when other validators replay blocks to make sure theyre good Solana validators have super good hardware but we dont even use that many of the cpu threads for actually executing transactions and the current block space limits 48 million compute units were conceived for the use of 4 cpu threads our validator server has 48 cpu threads The older block packing algorithm was also really bad at handling situations where a certain transaction type was spammed heavily nft mints for example and degraded parallelism Anyway it seems that these newer replay algorithms are over 2x better than the current implementations you can find more about them in the depths of github or discord Some seem close to productionready and I think we will see faster confirmation times and increasing of the block compute limits ABIv2 is another architectural change that will substantially improve throughput as well afaik but I know less on this subject Im not sure when this will be ready but Ive heard that the earlier half of the year is the target There are other upcoming changes to look forward to but its probably best to summarize in another post Here are some of the block packingreplay algos You can look at how much compute transactions use in the Solana explorer when clicking on slots The very large hundreds of thousands of compute transactions tend to be MEV transactions which are far more complex and compute heavy than transfers 3 Jump TradingCrypto has an incredible engineering team might be the best in crypto tbh and is working on the second Solana validator implementation Firedancer which should make the network even more performant and robust They will be going through the current validator implementation by Solana Labs and increasing documentation around it and presumably finding areas for improvement of the existing one as well Kevin Bowers is leading this project and is the Chief Science Officer of Jump Trading and has an incredible amount of experience in high performance computing He has been committing code on weekends and you can track things on the Firedancer github 4 Diet Clients Im not sure when these will happen but they will basically result in a way for normal users to be more protected without having to run a full node and will decentralize things quite a bit further They have some properties that are similar to the trustminimized light client system developed by Celestia My validator partner Dubbelosix will be posting an article on the subject soon,Positive,0.9986

The Solana DEX Birthed From FTXs Downfall Source Analyzing Serums exposure to threats the response from Solanas DeFi community OpenBook Program Statistics and the future of DeFi on Solana Table of Contents Introduction Serums Exposure to Threat Response From Solanas DeFi community OpenBook Program Statistics The Future of DeFi on Solana Introduction The OpenBook Program was deployed on Nov 14 2022 after contagion from the FTX collapse spread deep into Solanas DeFi ecosystem Among the key projects affected was Serum ProtocolA quick primer Serum Protocol was one of Solanas core DeFi infrastructures with a Central Limit Order Book CLOB mechanism that ensured optimal order matching on decentralised exchanges This mechanism powered some of the biggest DeFi protocols on Solana including Raydium Mango Markets and Jupiter Aggregator Serums Exposure to Threat Amongst the many repercussions of FTXs downfall was a security breach on the exchange and thus a possibility of the Serum program update key being compromised The smart contract together with all the protocols that ran on top of it were under imminent threat Serum DEX Program flagged on SolanaFM Explorer amidst the FTX hack Source SolanaFM Mango Markets cofounder Maximilian Schneider was one of the first responders of the situation he reported that Serums update keys were not controlled by the SRM DAO Sources from the community later verified that the Serum keys belonged to FTX this meant that the program keys could potentially be compromised and fall into the hands of bad actors linked to the FTX hack Mango Markets cofounder Maximilian Schneider was one of the first responders of the situation he reported that Serums update keys were not controlled by the SRM DAO Sources from the community later verified that the Serum keys belonged to FTX this meant that the program keys could potentially be compromised and fall into the hands of bad actors linked to the FTX hack Mango Markets cofounder Max Schneider reporting Serums potential exposure to threat Source Twitter Prominent voices in the community also cautioned against interacting with the Serum program Users as well as market makers were advised to cancel any open orders they had on Serumpowered protocols and put a hold on active trading activities Response From Solanas DeFi community To safeguard this integral part of Solana DeFi developers and leaders from prominent protocols joined hands to deploy OpenBook a communitydriven fork of Serums V3 program This fork of the Serum program essentially allows the community to have a shared custody of Serums infrastructure and governance taking over where FTX had left off The new OpenBook Program Source SolanaFM Several projects played crucial roles in the deployment and integration of OpenBook into Solanas DeFi ecosystem Decentralized exchanges DEXes like Raydium and Solape now run on and share liquidity to OpenBook Jupiter Aggregator Solanas key liquidity aggregator has included liquidity from OpenBook in their SDKAPIs for future integrators Switchboard a leading Solana oracle protocol has allowed price data to include OpenBooks liquidity OpenSerum a DeFi market data provider has developed extensive dashboards covering the various markets utilizing OpenBook Mango Markets has announced that their V4 program will integrate the OpenBook program The first batch of Solana DeFi protocols integrating the OpenBook program On top of these integrators key members from Solend Protocol took charge of managing OpenBooks Twitter and Discord channels actively engaging in community discussions and encouraging migration into the communityled fork OpenBook Program Statistics At the time of writing OpenBooks top 24H markets SOLUSDC and mSOLUSDC had recorded 2100000 and 1000000 in trading volume respectively Within the first week of its launch the OpenBook program saw over 1600 Daily Active Users DAUs these numbers are set to increase as more integrations take place across the ecosystem Daily Active Users include wallets interacting with SOL wSOL USDC and USDT tokens respectively via OpenBook OpenBook program statistics 24H Trading Volume Daily Active Users DAU In comparison to other Solana DEXes OpenBook has been picking up the pace the visual below shows OpenBook surpassing Serum in terms of daily active wallets making up 42 of active wallets across all Solana DEXes The Future of DeFi on Solana The downfall of FTX presents an opportunity to rebuild Solanas DeFi ecosystem as a community with collective governance and decisionmaking rather than having a single entity run the show The development of OpenBook is a testimony to the resilience of builders on Solana despite the market conditions builders have shown exemplary efforts in implementing

Jump vs the Speed of Light Source Have you ever been in a race against the speed of light Kevin Bowers has Watch our Chief Science Officer explain the challenges of building Firedancer below or read the technicals here Jump vs the Speed of Light Blog Post The speed of light is too slow This was my answer when toward the end of interviews over a decade ago Jump Tradings CIO Albert Saplitski asked What do you think is the greatest challenge facing Jump His reaction suggested my answer was atypical While this answer probably correctly categorized me as Kevin Bowers The BlueSky SciFi Guy it was based on my experiences creating algorithms software hardware and networks for the largest supercomputers in the world to simulate laser fusion at Los Alamos do protein origami at DE Shaw Research and model materials processing plasmas at Berkeley among others In pushing supercomputers to the limits it became blindingly obvious Einsteins speed of light limit and Shannons channel capacity limit strongly constrained computing Due to basic physics and information theory at that time there was a dramatic mismatch between the ability of computers to crunch numbers and their ability to move numbers around Arithmetic was practically free relative to data motion To scale up codes it was ordersofmagnitude more important to optimize data choreography than to optimize compute Since then improvements in chip manufacturing have increased this mismatch The puzzled looks I got when rattling off rulesofthumb like the speed of light is about a foot per nanosecond to developers from more traditional backgrounds indicated they were discouraged from even musing about the existence of physical limits Courses books tutorials languages operating systems development tools and hardware architectures were unaware at best and conspired at worst to make compute look expensive and data motion look cheap With rare exceptions eg CUDA and this is a major factor in its success developers could not easily express spatial locality data flow and concurrency needs Worse these details were often deliberately hidden as development environments strived to present a fiction that modern computers were just a faster version of a PC from 1982 Unsurprisingly these developers usually achieved results that only scratched the surface of what was physically possible When they needed more performance they were encouraged to buy more hardware When their immediate bottleneck was throughput this could work for a while But the ultimate bottleneck is the speed of light It was immediately evident in my interviews with Jump that they were already headbumping against these limits struggling with these environments and uncertain how to move forward The intense competition between market participants driven by the mechanics of how exchanges match orders between buyers and sellers was forcing Jump to evolve Over the years I have helped Jump transition from conventional C trading software in a conventional opensource Linux environment running on conventional commodity servers connected by conventional networking and backed by conventional file systems to a highly customized technology stack implemented from transistor and fiber optic up Though most principles from my prior supercomputing work carried over directly there were differences including Traditional supercomputers are localized to just one data center Jumps systems work at global scale Exchanges are scattered throughout the world Exchange matching policies combined with speed of light limits require a physical presence near each one to be competitive Traditional supercomputers tend to be procured all at once bigbang style resulting in a highly homogeneous technology stack Jumps systems work in a radically heterogeneous world Different markets have different technical and regulatory requirements for receiving market data and sending orders Data centers have wildly varying space power and cooling restrictions Communication between exchanges and data centers have different latencies bandwidths reliabilities costs physical layers and network protocols Traditional supercomputers tend to be retired and replaced whole at their end of life Jumps systems evolve incrementally New technologies are introduced existing technologies are running and old uncompetitive technologies are retired all concurrently Even if we had the desire to temporarily shut down trading in a market to upgrade the technology stack we are often required from a regulatory perspective to keep trading If a job on a traditional supercomputer takes seconds to achieve full speed it does not matter if it will be running for hours or more Jumps systems are prompt at levels offtheshelf solutions do not even try to contemplate Taking microseconds to spin up a machine learning calculation in response to new market data is already ordersofmagnitude too slow to be competitive in many modern markets On a traditional supercomputer a misbehaving job is typically killed to give other jobs a chance to run then tried again after a postmortem debugging Jumps systems are transparently fault tolerant At global scale equipment failures are random but routine Worse the competitive nature of markets results in emergent behavior akin to an unending denialofservice attack by multiple determined sophisticated adversaries At the same time misbehaving systems can have severe realworld legal and financial consequences We need to have a low bug rate to limit system downtime the ability to fail gracefully to mitigate risks realtime monitoring to detect errant behaviors and transparency for operators so they can quickly resolve issues The developer and the user are often the same for traditional supercomputers Jumps systems on the other hand have been adopted by a broad community Traders are often not from high performance computing backgrounds but nevertheless need low timetomarket for competitive implementations of their strategies Time spent retraining as a supercomputing expert is time not trading ie money lost If it takes years to adopt innovative technology that technology might as well not exist Traditional supercomputers rarely have strict data retention requirements Jumps systems are accountable over long time scales We might be asked detailed questions many years in the future about what our systems were doing on a particular day and why This creates logging reliability and persistence requirements far beyond that of traditional supercomputers Most importantly Jump cannot buy its way out of technology bottlenecks Exchange matching rules heavily incentivize being the first to market with the best mutually beneficial deals Scaling up uncompetitive hardware puts us in a position to be in second and third and place expensively offering best deal benefits to no one least of all us Most commodity technology vendors are oblivious to these dynamics Outside of rare niches like quantitative finance and extreme supercomputing developer cost matters more than machine cost throughput matters more than latency if performance is a concern at all and problems often have an embarrassingly parallel flavor Unsurprisingly technology vendors have been optimizing the ease of scaling up hardware with little concern for the impact on latency Jumps approach was and had to be different We were already limited by the speed of light when I joined The only option to stay competitive was to develop our own technologies Today Jumps systems for production trading and quantitative research run at the limits of the physics and information theory at planetary scale This includes custom networking network protocols network switching technology network interfaces ASICs FPGAs time synchronization lockfree algorithms file systems all designed with real world physical limits in mind In short Jump is as much a technology firm as a trading firm And much of the tech is at the edge of science fiction What does this have to do with Solana Everything Solana needs an independent interoperable second validator to support its communitys longterm needs This validator needs to work at global scale in a radically heterogeneous world It needs to evolve incrementally from the existing validator Be transparently fault tolerant Be accountable Be easily adoptable by a broad community Sound familiar In short Solana is facing the same problems Jump has been facing And while the latency requirements for this validator are not as stringent today as they are for quantitative finance ideally the validator would position Solana for even more impact long term by utilizing the latest algorithms software hardware and networking technologies to increase the transaction throughput and drop the cost per transaction as low as possible We have named this second validator Firedancer We are developing this second validator in the open and welcome both feedback and participation from the Solana community Further we are tailoring the development process to enable others to produce additional independent interoperable validators Some might look at this project and think it impossible And it is ambitious with many potential pitfalls but even more potentially farreaching benefits It is not out of our reach And we have never backed down from a challenge Even if that challenge is the speed of light itself We believe we can do this Because we have done this before,Positive,0.9931

Empire Weekly Roundup Anatoly Yakovenko Ben Sparango join the hosts of the pod Jason and Santi to discuss Solanas future in the aftermath of FTX SBF and FTX were core investors and contributors to the Solana ecosystem How did Solana get so intertwined with FTX How badly was Solana damaged as a result How will Solana recover These are just a few of the questions we explore Read our notes below to learn more How Did Solana Get So Intertwined With FTX In 2018 when Solana was founded the founders wanted to build a central limit order book that could help find price discovery on a blockchain 4 out of 8 engineers at the time were allocated to build Serum DEX on Solana In 2020 Solana got a pretty big lift up once there were wallets better UI and market makers with the help of FTX Anatoly thought SBF was a giga brain as he was from MIT running a top crypto exchange and Alameda FTX was listing new coin perps and didnt help the price discovery that should happen for a project early on for different Solana ecosystem projects FTX Ventures started investing in competitors to Solana like Aptos in 2022 How Important Was SBF To Solanas Growth Hard to predict how Solana would have grown without SBF might have taken a little longer for Solana to get traction DeFi has been hit hard because the macro is bad and FTX collapsed NFTs and other sectors are thriving on Solana Fallout From Reliance On FTX Solana foundation conducts hackathons and everything on its own now the reliance on SBF got reduced when SBF started focusing on building the FTX brand and we started to do things on our own Did You See This Coming Both Anatoly and Ben were totally blindsided and didnt see this coming Hard to grasp what happened at the BreakPoint conference and the events that followed starting from Coindesks FTX assets info leak What Exchanges Got Wrong Alamedas 10 SOL Stake Exchanges stopped accepting stablecoins briefly from Solana because of the misconception that the transactions on the Solana chain could be modified by the validators Even if Alameda had 100 of Solanas stake they wouldnt be able to spend anyones USDC without their signature as the assets are selfcustodied by the user There are going to be a whole bunch of SOL tokens waiting for court decisions FTX Impact On Solana Apps Developers There were 34 projects on Solana that had their treasuries on FTX and they are being properly connected to VCs to raise funding and continue building Solana is talking with projects that need assurance that Solana is capable of thriving without FTXs help Where Does Solana Go From Here The Mango hack and FTX collapse back to back was bad for Solana DeFi Solana is going to continue launching products that are good and attract TVL A lot of eth accounts on Twitter were messaging Anatoly with positive messages during a hard time A lot of criticism coming from the Ethereum community is fair and it is addressed in our engineering roadmap Solanas Fee Markets Decentralization Questions Criticism of the fee mechanism prior to outages was fair and helped Solana to get where it is now Crypto is amazing for builders as competitors can tell you to fix things by looking at the opensource code Calling Solana not decentralized is a dumb argument An open decentralized execution layer is important Solving Solanas Network Outages People minting NFTs felt like a DDOS attack Solana had to throw their old design which was faulty One way to think about how Solana works now is by running different auctions and picking the top 10 auctions that are the highestgrossing ones and fitting those into a block There is no global fee system and there are separate fees for different markets Ex If there is an NFT mint and DeFi is not congested DeFi transaction will have a base fee while the NFT mint will have a competing fee The amount of traffic to validators is capped based on staked weight Monolithic Blockchains Layer 2s New Learnings The way to create a blockchain that creates value for the world is by implementing a single layer thats globally synchronized without sharding and having a single sequencer L2 for derivates that could help with highfrequency trading All the L2 solutions being built will work on Solana The chance that the majority of the validators go rogue must become near zero It is difficult to coordinate with validators when there are thousands of them Economic Sustainability L1s should be permissionless and anyone should be able to observe the state of the network The fee increase in a network should guarantee reliability Avalanche vs Cosmos Whos Solanas Main Competitor Cosmos is the main competitor for Solana as it has very robust tools for spinning up a private network The Importance Of Business Development Solana BDs focus is on getting new developers to build different use cases on Solana Solanas BD team is helping projects in the ecosystem to build their own BD team Google Partnership The Solana Phone Solanas partnership with Google is infrastructure oriented Google Cloud could help with querying the huge permissionless data on Solana Solana phone will help the transition from doing crypto transactions on a desktop to securely doing it through a phone Solana Phone could help pay crypto stablecoins to vendors around the world Solana phone has over 6000 preorders and the target units for the next year are between 25000 to 50000 The Solana Saga phone has the Solana Mobile Stack which could be integrated into Android phones Ethereum and Bitcoin networks could also be added to the Solana phone Check Out These

Developer and User Activity on Solana December 2022 Source Understanding the ecosystem and developer growth on Solana is important to help identify how well the chain is performing But measuring this growth can be sometimes difficult Solana is unique in how users create and process transactions and tracking activity is very different from many other blockchains out there Instead of comparing apples to oranges theres a number of correct ways to measure users and developers on Solana Users Blockchains are open transparent systems that publicize data about their users but how do we effectively track users onchain The naive way of tracking users would be to assume one address equals one user however this is susceptible to sybil attacks To effectively track users on a blockchain it is important to adopt a more robust approach Most blockchains use the signer of a transaction to identify a single user which means that someone had to cryptographically sign to have the transaction processed correctly In the case of Solana using unique signers were likely to include bots and other programmatic activity This is because with the account structure multiple accounts that are owned by one human can sign for a transaction The main drawback of measuring users based on unique signers is that were more likely to capture programmatic activity instead of actual users On Solana the feePayer is the address that pays for the fees of a transaction The first address listed in each transaction is the feePayer This metric is our proxy for the number of noncustodial wallets active in the Solana ecosystem We say proxy since fee payers can refer to a centralized fee payer that pays fees on behalf of users such as a centralized wallet provider The feePayer is the current best metric to measure users because it is a measure of dedicated users while not encompassing a lot of the programmatic activity on the network Source Flipside Using unique feePayers as users on Solana we can see that users peaked earlier this year at 27 million Since then the monthly users have trailed back down to where we were right before the peak Developers One of the best metrics to understand how a chain is growing is the total number of developers building on the chain To track developers on Solana you need to have an understanding the current libraries developers use At the Solana Foundation we use the Github API to track the projects using the following libraries in the Solana ecosystem Using the Github queries provided you will be able to scrape Solanarelated repositories based on the libraries used Once you have the repositories you can pull data on who committed code on each day Pulling commits and subsequent committers you can start to build up a data set that can tell you trends retention and more Before we dig into that data we need to define what it means to be a developer on Solana Solanarelated repositories can be multichain or even not be entirely focused on Solana A great example is an opensource multichain wallet The focus of a multichain wallet repository is likely not just Solana so it might not be accurate to assume that a developer contributing to that repository is a Solana developer When we count Solana developers we count developers working on repositories that happen to support Solana separately from developers working on repositories that are solely focused on Solana development In November Solana has had 2053 total active developers on projects with a Solana integration including multichain projects 1654 of those active developers are working on a project that is only focused on Solana This total number of developers shows a holistic view of how the developer community has grown around Solana Its important to note that a decent number of these developers may just be trying Solana for the first time versus being a fulltime developer building on Solana Lets define the difference as x200B Fulltime developer Commit on 5 or more days in the past month Onetime developer Commit on 1 day in the past month In the past month we have seen 1139 onetime developers 120 fulltime developers We can see that there is a decent drop off between onetime developers and fulltime developers on Solana This can help determine the retention rate between someone just trying out Solana for the first time and later becoming a Solana developer While we can measure a lot about the Solana developer ecosystem it is good to note that we can only measure data that is currently public We lose a lot of information on the developer ecosystem for Solana because private repositories or organizations on Github cannot be viewed Open sourcing code can help developers looking to integrate on your project and give a more accurate view of the number of developers working on Solana today Using knowledge on the libraries and tooling a developer ecosystem uses can help you gather data and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the chain The Solana Foundation is committed to transparency and updates to this data and methodology will be shared regularly by the Developer Relations team We welcome feedback or comments on how the data was collected and how things can be improved,Positive,0.9978

Imran of Kyber Network is joined by Carvas from Lido Finance to discuss maximizing ETH liquidations concentrated liquidity wstETH trading pair partnership and more x200B Read our notes below to learn more x200B About Lido Finance The liquid staking giant in Ethereum network that provides a cutting edge liquid staking mechanism power in both CeFi and DeFi apps in its thriving ecosystem It gives stakers the ability to spend the staked assets on the networks they support which are Ethereum Solana Polygon Optimism and more x200B About Carvas A contributor in Lido and his main focus is liquidity x200B Farming in DeFi Farming is the word that people use for a plenty of different strategies in DeFi in general In DeFi summer 2020 liquidity mining was pioneered by Compound where the idea is that you will give out governance tokens to incentivize people to do activities with their funds For Lido its mostly liquidity pools because st assets token representations of the staked positions can be sold collateralized and bought x200B Benefits of adding LP in wstETHany tokens compared to ETHany tokens stETH can also be used in DeFi just as wstETH can be For stETH it keeps accruing in terms of balance on your wallet representing the yield that youre accumulating For wstETH the balance in your wallet remains constant but the value of it starts diverging upwards because it is accumulating that yield inside the token Most of their liquidity is against ETH so basically stETH against ETH on Curve or wstETH against ETH on Balancer and these are some of the largest pools in DeFi They are now trying to diversify liquidity as a DAO to other pairs and the tradeoff is that if youre LPing wstETH against ETH you would expect that the trading value would be somewhat low because theres not much arbitrage going on Their review is that if you are a new project and you want to incentivize some liquidity pool a good choice to consider would be to pair your token with wstETH because thats where your LPs are already receiving some yield The drawback is ETH is such a canonical asset and it doesnt really have application layer smart contract risk on top Barriers to entry and strategies for getting through They have different layers of different strategies people can do that are increasingly added on top of the previous one In their view the best way to stake ETH is through the liquid staking derivative If people want to stake ETH natively they have to do it in multiples of 32 ETH so if they have less than 32 ETH they couldnt do it With Lido users can stake any amount they want and theres no limits If people stake ETH directly they would lose access to that ETH until withdrawals are enabled but with Lido users get the token representation which is stETH and can exit that position at any point in future By having the token representation which is stETH people can use that as a composable lego in different DeFi strategies Users can get impermanent loss but theyre also getting a lot of incentives on top of that x200B Why users trade between ETH and wstETH The main advantage to holding ETH is people get price exposure and its like longing the asset but with stETH and wstETH they get the same but with yields as well ETH is the best collateral in DeFi in general because it will be accepted everywhere and also accepted in LPs everywhere Over the past two years Lido has integrated stETH and wstETH pretty much everywhere When using stETH instead of ETH as collateral when borrowing it offsets the interest rate of the loan or still gets yields from your collateral while that wouldnt happen with ETH as collateral x200B Preventing impermanent loss in general Theres pretty much no way around impermanent loss in DeFi In the AMM model its something thats built into the design In an AMM design if one token is going up in value relative to the other the AMM itself is selling the token on the way up so as the token goes up its effectively exiting that position progressively and accumulating the other token thats going down x200B Benefits of Lido farms People can exit their position whenever they want stETH is integrated across protocols and a big portion of that is being used as collateral Whenever people use something as a collateral they need to have the ability to liquidate that position in the future if that collateral drops in value relative to the borrowing demand against it The ability to liquidity is driven by how deep the pools for certain assets are x200B Benefits of the partnership Whenever they do these types of partnerships there is a winwin scenario where both of them are better off by doing it together rather than getting the goals alone Lido is giving a significant amount of LDO incentives to the pools on Kyber each month from their rewards program and that attracts a lot of TVL to Kyber Kyber LPed a significant amount of ETH on wstETHETH pool without taking the rewards and made that pool liquid as well then gave KNC rewards on top QA Q What is the structure of Lido Finance Is it decentralized or open sourced protocol If so how does the governance work Lido is both a DAO and a protocol Their governance process has three phases first one is completely offchain and vote free permissionless discussion then those proposals pass to snapshot and people can vote and lastly launching full DAO governance where people can vote onchain for proposals thats going to be implemented There is a dual governance proposal ongoing where it can allow voting for both LDO holders and stETH holders Everybody can contribute through discord governance forums and others x200B Q Can the liquidity problems that may occur in a wide range of blockchains can be solved with the cooperation of Lido and Kyber Swap The chains that they support are Ethereum Solana Polkadot and Kusama and they also support EVM compatible chains like Moonbeam Moonriver Polygon On the chains that theyre on especially mainnet and L2s they do contribute a lot to the liquidity on those chains because stETH is one of the assets that has the deepest pools in DeFi They have more than 1B TVL overall in the pools in this current bear market Their pools on Kyber also contribute to liquidity outside Kyber just for the chains itself because its routed via aggregators that end up routing some of the trades x200B Q Do you think the real value of DeFi has been understood by people after the FTX crisis Will it take DeFi to new heights in the upcoming bull market The mainstream news or narratives about crypto in general doesnt really distinguish between what a decentralized protocol is or what a company running a centralized exchange is Theres stuff to learn about products that do hit product market fit like what FTX had What happened in FTX will never happen in a transparent protocol like DeFi Some people that were trading on FTX ended up moving to dYdX or GMX in Arbitrum It is bullish for DeFi with all the centralized entities collapsing this year x200B Q Why are there some farms with high APY but are still losing Can you share some ways to optimize LPs If you think the price will be on certain levels you can go with much more concentrated liquidity and you can estimate how many fees youre going to get based on current volume Theres no comparison in traffic or other markets for the specific design of concentrated liquidity where its still particularly a mix between pool model and the advantages of being permissionless open to retail The concentrated liquidity venues have been gaining a lot of share because it is literally more efficient x200B Q What is the future development of Lido after Ethereum staking withdrawal is open Theres some very good discussion happening on their research forum about it People can check the forums if they want to go deep Check out these important Follow Revelo Intel for more notes like this Watch the original video,Positive,0.9994

Solstice 2022 Reasons To Be Excited For 2023 Twitter Post Blog Post If 2021 was the year that the Solana community stepped into the sunlight 2022 was the year for shipping and scaling And what a year its been Theres been the highs of Breakpoint and the lows of the volatile market Throughout it all the Solana community has only gotten stronger and kept their heads down to keep on building As we once again arrive at the Solana Solstice its important to take a breath take stock of what weve accomplished and get excited for whats to come Heres why you should bet on the Solana community in 2023 New protocols for realworld uses This year the Solana community was focused on bringing crypto into the real world This could be typified by the introduction of two new protocols from Solana Labs that helped seed a whole ecosystem of new projects Solana Mobile Stack and Solana Mobiles flagship device Saga announced to much acclaim at a surprise event in June aims to free web3 from desktops and make mobile a much friendlier to dApps Saga also brings a nearhardware wallet level of security to mobile devices uniting security and simplicity DVT1 the first Saga development kits started shipping this December Consumer units will ship in early 2023 Solana Pay introduced in February has kickstarted a frictionless permissionless payment ecosystem Its now being used by stores and brands alike and will continue to grow in 2023 Developers developers developers The developers are here and theyre building 2022 was a banner year for the humble Solana dev As of the end of November there were 2053 total active developers working on projects that use Solana and 1654 of those working on Solanaonly projects This explosion in developer growth might be because what was once considered chewing glass is now more like surfing glass Theres been massive growth in developer education and tooling for the Solana ecosystem making it easier for new builders to hit the ground running and get started The rise of SolanaU on college campuses is not to be underestimated SolanaU Ambassadors helped students and professors at universities from Berkeley to Belgrade The next cohort of SolanaU Ambassadors is taking applications until December 22nd Mainstream adoption is coming This was the year that traditional companies took notice of the power of the Solana ecosystem In a surprise announcement that took the web3 world by storm Google Cloud said that they have been running a blocksupporting Solana validator They are also extending support for Blockchain Node Engine to Solana so anyone in the world can run a validator in the cloud and indexing Solana data for easier historical research in Big Query 2022 was also the year that Brave integrated Solana into their wallet The privacyfocused browser announced the integration at Breakpoint 2021 which would give default support to Solana dApps in their mobile and web browsers The integration completed in 2022 making it much easier for noncrypto native internet users to get started on Solana Heres just a sampling of some of the other traditional projects who started building on Solana this year ASICSamerica Phantom Discords Linked Roles Stripe Helium Migrating To Solana Ledger Partnering With Solanamobile The network keeps getting better After a series of bugs last spring the core Solana engineers and greater Solana ecosystem have been singularly focused on improving the network And by many metrics their efforts have succeeded The Solana network is now more stable decentralized and faster than ever before In order to evaluate the progress the Solana Foundation has been releasing a series of reports analyzing the network and identifying what areas still need improvement Heres what they found Solana network usage averages around 4000 transactions per second thousands more than the nearest competitor Solana is arguably one of the most decentralized Layer1 blockchains As of Dec 21st Solana has 1911 independent validators and a Nakamoto coefficient of 30 The average Solana nonvoting transaction uses less energy than three Google searches far less an Ethereum transaction even using estimates from after the Merge The entire Solana network uses less energy per year than a single Bitcoin transaction The entire Solana network is carbon neutral thanks to the support of the Solana Foundation Even during the collapse of FTX a stress test of the network Solana performed well under pressure Average block time or the time it takes for the network to produce new blocks is a good proxy for the performance of the network Even with the high volume of transactions on Nov 8 average block time was at 61 ms well below the historical average The network is set to improve even more with the release of Jump Cryptos Firedancer a second validator client A new validator client when adopted means its extremely unlikely that any single bug will bring down the Solana network making it more secure and stable Firedancer will make Solana the only other blockchain network besides Ethereum to have more than one validator client Kevin Bowers FireDancer Demo And did we mention that its lightning fast Firedancer will turbocharge transaction times on Solana taking the networks respectable TPS from the thousands to the hundreds of thousands if not millions Firedancer processed 6 million transactions per second in a recent live demo in a test environment Solana is IRL 2022 might be the year that the Solana community left the internet and started making its mark in the real world Solana Spaces a company dedicated to bringing the Solana community off the internet and into retail spaces has opened two locations in the last year The two locations one in New York City and their flagship Solana Embassy in Miami showcase projects from the ecosystem and help onboard new users And with SpacesDAO their new decentralized approach to franchising Solana Spaces will be coming to locations literally around the world Solana 2023 Hacker House Schedule Meanwhile Solana Hacker Houses took the world by storm More than 24 Solana Hacker Houses from Berlin to Bangalore and Seoul to Seattle created spaces for Solana developers to build learn and showcase their projects Thousands attended these events even at the height of market volatility kicking off a cottage industry of blockchainfocused spaces for builders There are a dozen Solana Hacker Houses already open for registration in 2023 SolanaBreakpoint 2022 Of course all the reallife energy culminated in Breakpoint the annual conference put on by the Solana Foundation More than 3800 members of the Solana community gathered in Lisbon nearly double the number of attendees the previous year to see thoughtful discussions dig into the tech and hear from the ecosystem about whats coming up next year What are you most excited about in 2023 Happy Solana Solstice We cant wait to see what you build wagmi,Positive,0.9983

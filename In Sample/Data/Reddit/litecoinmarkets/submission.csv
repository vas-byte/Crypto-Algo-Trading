&#x200B;

How many of you follow different guides related to purchasing Bitcoins, Etherum, and other cryptocurrencies?

&#x200B;

To be honest, I'm a rookie in all this cryptocurrency trading and stuff like this. Besides, I know that it's better not to touch this water if you are not an expert. Still, I'm interested in investing my savings somewhere to multiply them in the future. Indeed, I always hear in the news that Bitcoins value is growing. Even despite the recent significant drop in the market, the value of Bitcoin continues to grow. Besides, even if you check out the graph from the Bitcoins launch and the current moment, you will see how the value has increased. I would even say there are some enormous numbers. So, I can say for sure that those early birds who purchased Bitcoins for a reasonable price now definitely can allow themselves not to work if they want to.

&#x200B;

Besides, I could spot the same tendency with other cryptos too. Usually, financial analytics compare Bitcoin and Etherum. They are pretty similar. Still, I stick to the point that all cryptos are somehow linked to Bitcoin. This financial asset is brand new on the market. So, no one knows where all these things go in the end. Some experts state that it is impossible to mine cryptos forever, and all this mining will stop at some point. So the price of other cryptocurrencies somehow is affected by Bitcoin's trends.

&#x200B;

But, on the other hand, there are some factors too that affect the price of any altcoin or token. For instance, when I was doing a little research on this potential investment, I came across this guide — [https://bitcoinbuy101.com/](https://bitcoinbuy101.com/). I was literally shocked by how many detailed instructions they posted on different cryptos. They state that there are 50+ coins in their database (I'm sorry, I dunno how else I should call it). But, I wonder if anyone uses any guidelines on purchasing cryptos? How do you choose them, and are they worth our trust?

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if I'm wrong somewhere in my discussion. I'm doing research and quite interested in your opinion about different guidelines and investing in altcoins in general.","self","https://redd.it/s27cv6"

Macro structure of BTC on the weekly and Daily broke key levels of support and I think the inevitable bear market is upon us.

My question is how can this be over without Litecoin doing any major?... the ratio didnt budge for this entire bull run and we barely got to ATH. You can call it a wide accumulation for a bigger move but I feel time for that is over. As long as BTC doesnt go up LTC wont go up either and the ratio is in my opinion the scariest thing to consider here.

USD values for LTC barely eclipsed the consensus ATH (not counting coinbases 420).  Before the market dumped in May and it never came close to ATH in November. 

So basically, were these people right? is Litecoin just an afterthought in comparison to other payments technology? Will long term hodlers give up and sell? People that have been hodling since 2018 are they gone? 

What will you do if the the 4 year support on LTCBTC eventually capitulates, at what point does DCAing into Litecoin becomes useless? Would love to hear the thoughts of fellow LTC hodlers","self","https://redd.it/sa667u"

The report lays out the pros and cons of government-issued crypto but ultimately takes no position on the matter. Notably, the report included a callout for more input from the public and other stakeholders before further action is taken. The Fed acknowledged in the report that the creation of a government-issued digital currency “would represent a highly significant innovation in American money.”

It is also possible that someone steals the idea😁

For some time now, I have been trying to research and build a mobile Application that will enhance P2P market in Africa and I discovered unique differences about the exchange rates of different companies and countries.


***I will be using Nigeria as the case study.***

Exchange rates of Dollar to naira

Black Market - $1 = 570 Naira
Most Banks - $1 = 490 Naira
International Bodies, CBN, PayPal - $1 = 420 Naira

Most Crypto lovers around Africa are forced to buy dollar from the black market and then convert it to the needed Cryptocurrency.

This App tends to connect foreign Litecoin whales(or people ready to sell Crypto) to Local crypto lovers in Nigeria and Africa at large.

We plan on creating an international P2P market. Where Litecoin can be converted  to any flat note.

People in Africa and other areas of the world where Cryptocurrency is limited and not formally accepted as a legal tender can make direct transfers or card payments to Paypal or Payoneer accounts of whales and the whales(Litecoin Owner) will send the required amount of Litecoin. This approach will be cheaper than Buying Litecoin in Binance(for Nigerians and others).

***Verification***
To reduce scammers, every seller on the International P2P market will be verified and fully registered. Limits and rates will be placed on sellers depending on their activities.

*** Software Dev ***
We plan on making the project open source so that more people can contribute and direct the course of this idea.

*** Budget ***
No fixed amount. If the project is approved, we may receive donations to support the open source developers and to increase the code quality.

*** Audience ***
All Africas and Areas where Cryptocurrency is not a legal tender and are interested in buying Crypto.

*** Litecoin ***
Because of the cheap gas fee, we plan on using Litecoin as the standard digital value in the P2P system 

Conclusion 
I believe deeply that most ""Africa Crypto Buyers"" will immediately adapt this approach in buying their digital Assets because of low expenses.

I'm open to hear from us all.

Thank you.

These exchanges will be used by traders who want to have fun, create pump and dump schemes, and trade altcoins.

It will take a while before large banks start implementing cryptocurrencies, which is why we’ve chosen to go ahead and create one ourselves. With [www.6banc.com](https://www.6banc.com/) you can start using a bank account with all the features above, and finally be part of the push to help cryptocurrencies go mainstream.","self","https://redd.it/sinnsr"

$USD is a shitcoin and I'm so ready for a realistic alternative. 

Originally I got into crypto in 2017 to see what the hoopla was about. I saw some positions go wild, fun times. Could've cashed out, but with a meager investment I didn't see the point, wasn't anything life changing yet. 

Now I'm in it for the tech more than ever, because it's painfully obvious that traditional finance is a parasitic wasteland.

I posted a few weeks ago that I wanted to sell my soon to get here L7, well it’s finally here!

Here is my Craigslist add with recent pictures:

https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/ele/d/rego-park-bitmain-l7/7451835134.html

I’m asking 0.6 btc for it and prefer a face to face exchange. 

I know it’s hard to not appear as a scam.. I can provide the proof of payment by bitmain / do a facetime call, or anything that can assure it’s not a scam.

I just dont have time for this anymore and prefer to sell it.

After 3 years of being out of crypto I started to buy from March 2022  heavily LTC.

I wanted to buy BTC only and just hodl it for years.
But somehow I accidentally opened LTC/BTC chart and went completely \OuO)/

WHAT THE ????

BTC has supply of max 21 mil

LTC has supply of max 84 mil

BTC has 3/4 of a halving cycle in front of us 6.25 => 3.125 (2024)

LTC 12.5 => 6.25 (2023)

BTC is a store of value

LTC is a store of value with 4x supply and ""it is silver to Bitcoin""

BUT according to everyone else ""it is just for payments"" & ""rather buy other altcoins, cuz LTC is dead""


WTF???!!!!

Let's not mention 100% network uptime + almost $299 median transaction value ATH (today $180) compared to BTC $500+


It is f....ing UNDERVALUED it is a ""2nd Bitcoin"" with 4x supply and 4x less size of the network availability.
Once BTC has full blocks => LTC tends to skyrocket in network usage + price.

WHY is LTC $130 when BTC is $47000 (LTC/BTC0.00277)????
It is because majority of people are blindsided by 100k's of cryptos.

I think that when BTC will rise above 100k people will start to realise that there is still LTC that they can buy super cheaply.
We might even struggle to get above $700 around mid 2023-24... But maybe just after another halving in 2027 (6.25->3.125 LTC/block reward) people might turn crazy and start to buy LTC once supply of BTC will be running out around 1.56 BTC/block (2028)

Don't tell me that LTC can't literally 100x from today values and maybe be in (2031-2034) $130/LTC => $13000/LTC","self","https://redd.it/tqfx8b"

I believe that fundamentals will have their day and count, and that the chikun will succeed. Litecoin has all the fundamentals of sound money, even more so with the recent MWEB update. This will however, take time and patience for the world to wake up to.

The above quote has reminded me to be thankful for the efforts of the litecoin development team, foundation and anyone else associated. Thank you.","self","https://redd.it/whv8vm"

It’s an essential part of your daily routine, a pivotal point of your investing and trading escapades, and just something that helps you always be on the same wavelength with the latest crypto trades.  
  
Everybody is talking about this DYOR thingie, but do they really know how to do it? Time to put two and two together for the sake of a better understanding.   

### **Analyze, Analyze, and Analyze Again**

That’s not easy to invest in, especially when you don’t fully understand the field. But, all of a sudden, this particular point makes future research even more fascinating.

Your research could be profound to include the following aspects:

1.  Fundamental Analysis
    
2.  Technical Analysis
    
3.  Social media Analysis
    
4.  On-chain Analysis
    

DYOR in crypto demands various information gathering and filtering, which can be pretty harsh thanks to the crypto market full of red flags not easy to notice. DYOR gives you what’s an opportunity to embrace what’s happening in the crypto community and grants you the tools and sources essential for proper decision-making. 

Combined, these analysis practices can help you interpret market data and give you various aspects that will guide your trading. 

Here is the list of the most effective analysis practices for traders of all levels to do their research.   

### **Useful Analyzing Tools**

## **CoinMarketCap.com**

[**CoinMarketCap**](https://coinmarketcap.com/) is known worldwide for crypto market intelligence and research. It has deep market information on almost all the existing coins and tokens. It provides you with information diverse and topical information with any possible details. However, many new aspiring investors may be embarrassed by figuring out what to pay attention to.

The most interesting point for you is coin and token rankings regarding market capitalization or 24-hour trading volume. Later, you may look at information about specific tokens that you’re interested in. CoinMarketCap provides up-to-date information on each token or coin: the market cap, fully diluted market cap, trading volume, circulating supply, and the maximum supply allowed for the coin/token. These are the primary information you need in the first stage of becoming familiar with different currencies.

Studying the price charts of coins/tokens is also helpful to see how volatile they have been over a certain period. CoinMarketCap has amazing interactive charts to zoom in to different time periods and study the coin’s price movements in more detail.

## **DefiPulse.com**

As you know, most crypto and blockchain projects are decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. It will be very useful to know their TVL (Total Value Locked) statistics, not only the token's market cap, circulating supply, and other crucial indicators. 

TVL means the total amount locked in the platform's smart contracts, generally in the form of debt collateral or liquidity pool funds. It is a critical measure of a DeFi project's performance.

[**DeFi Pulse**](https://defipulse.com/) is a crypto research and news website that traces TVL stats for the most significant DeFi projects. While the website is a good source for general information about crypto and blockchain, its awesome feature is the up-to-date TVL stats.

## **CryptoCurrency on Reddit.com**

[**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/) is famous for being the biggest discussion forum, with a diverse web of subreddits dedicated to various topics. [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) is Reddit’s most prominent crypto and blockchain discussion board where you can find anything on crypto: starting from anecdotes to currencies people find the best for investing and trading at the moment.

This channel can be not only entertaining but also serves your DYOR aims, r/Cryptocurrency is an essential tool to get the freshest insights from various blockchain projects. All crypto projects, even small ones, are being actively discussed there.

Reddit can be pretty fruitful for your research in terms of asking people’s opinions who have been directly involved in crypto projects or have had experience buying cryptocurrencies. Crypto-related websites give you statistics on market caps, prices, charts, and other important metrics, but Reddit complements that with a unique experience of interacting directly with people about blockchain projects.

Starting a discussion on even some tiny projects can bring you a lot of responses and opinions underpinned by first-hand experience. Yet, don’t forget that any information from Reddit is generally based on subjective personal opinions. r/Cryptocurrency is a nice qualitative, not an academic-ish quantitative research tool.

**NB**! While reading opinions on Reddit, bear in mind the “shilling” phenomenon. Shilling means users provide untruthful, often promotional information to persuade others of their project’s cool and valuable.

## **TradingView.com**

[**TradingView**](https://www.tradingview.com/) is a platform built for investors and aspiring investors to share their experience, knowledge, opinions, and analysis on traditional finance and crypto investing topics. One of the platform's most fruitful features is community members' great charts to supply to the website.

This resource is ideal for accessing tailored analysis accomplished by the platform’s users into different crypto assets. Many users share high-quality technical analyses on cryptocurrencies and tokens. 

## **Google Trends**

[**Google Trends**](https://trends.google.com/trends/) is a free research tool by Google. It displays the popularity index and trend over time for any word or phrase searched for on the website. You can use it for tokens and coins to check on their popularity and being in trend just using their tickers. 

It is a great tool to monitor public interest in various tokens or cryptocurrencies. Google Trends allows you to customize your search results to specific countries and periods. Compare two or more search terms on the same chart if necessary.     

## **Crypto Project’s Blogs and Channels**

We can’t imagine a proper DYOR without carefully studying a blockchain project’s website and social media pages. Maybe that doesn’t look as serious and kind of snobbish as the mentioned recourses, but still, it could be a rich source for learning and getting new information. Have a look at the project’s website to find out critical information such as:  

*   The team behind the project, including the founders. Some projects provide many details about the people involved. The lack of information may also tell you something about the project, as less transparency may require further scrutiny.
    
*   A fully-described process of how the platform or application runs, including its tokenomics. You can find such information in the project’s white paper.
    
*   The project gathers venture capital.
    
*   More information on ownership, voting, and yield-earning rights token gets to its holders. That’s also described in the project’s white paper. 
    
*   Wallets and exchanges that listed the project’s token.
    

### **Things to Consider While DYOR**

Shilling is common in cryptocurrency, where people push their products in the hope of increasing their prices. It can be challenging to distinguish between a shill and an unbiased post. Deciding on your own before investing is advised when purchasing any cryptocurrency, not just because someone else has said it is worth it.

Sybil attacks are ‘expected’ guests on popular social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook. People with malicious intent can quickly create numerous fake accounts, trying to make investors buy a cryptocurrency based on “popular’ posts within a social media platform. Another moment when it’s better to stay skeptical and do your own research.

### **Wrap-Up**

Let’s sum that up. Doing your research may seem tedious, but it’s your key to success, and neglecting DYOR would be a bad idea. The crypto space is still terra incognita for many, and people are collecting pieces and bits of information from various resources to understand better what is going on and how to invest/trade smartly.

BTC is $20k, if it goes to its ATH of $69k that's a 3.5x return. ETH is $1200, if it goes to its ATH of $5,000 that's a 4x return. Litecoin is currently at $50, if it returns to its ATH of 450 that's a **9x on your money.**

Litecoin is very reliable, fast, and has tiny fees. I don't care about some random, obscure coin that can 100x your money. There are millions of those, and only 2 or 3 will succeed. However, with Litecoin, it's right there IN YOUR FACE. It has the history and the reputation. Are you too good for a 9x return?

Bitfinex : $0
Deribit : $0

If you have bought $LTC at any of them beside Binance, they actually sold you IOU of $LTC.

They don’t need to have $LTC until you withdraw.
This explained why $LTC hold stronger than $BTC during recent crashed.
- People withdraw their IOU $LTC from all exchanges
- They have 0 $LTC, need to buy on market to fulfill withdrawal.
- Therefore create demand in crumble market.

Conclusion:
-If this bank run continue across exchanges, $LTC will see massive demand.
-Sell pressure is basically minimal because they have 0 $LTC to sell on spot.
-Exchanges are playing with fire, they will have no choice but to bid $LTC price up.
Once supply dried up, 🚀

I anticipated, or perhaps blindly hoped, that LTC would be spared some of the carnage most of us knew had to be coming.  The “money printer” memes were more than a laugh…

Charlie’s hope is that Litecoin becomes a fungible, semi-anonymous, way to spend our “money” on a daily basis, but I wonder if he’s considered another use.  Something it’s already doing, and something people are talking about in other forums.  Which is basically a safe, store of wealth that is used as a bridge between cryptocurrencies; namely BTC to anything, and vice versa.  

Litecoin wallet addresses growing faster than others, volume always stays high, so many indicators speak to its stability that I guess I shouldn’t be surprised at the price weathering the storm a bit better.  

Regardless, I still anticipate further slides and hope to pile in a bunch of cash at the right time.  And buy more miners.","self","https://redd.it/z1z3la"

In the past 24 hours, Litecoin (LTC) has increased by 30%. After several weeks of significant losses for digital currencies, Litecoin was managed to maintain its price above where it was two weeks ago. The imminent halving in 2023 is just one of several factors that can have increased the price of this virtual currency.

Now we see [overbought indicators](https://altfins.com/crypto-screener/ltc-litecoin) flashing which means we can see correction to the price. Litecoin price will go higher towards the halving event.

**Trade setup:** Despite the pullback, price has maintained its upward trend. If it can stay above $60 level and 200-day moving average, it could revisit $75 resistance. (set a price [alert](https://altfins.com/knowledge-base/create-alert-for-cryptocurrencies/)).

**Trend:** Uptrend across all time horizons (Short- Medium- and Long-Term).

**Momentum**is Mixed as[ MACD ](https://altfins.com/knowledge-base/macd-line-and-macd-signal-line/)Line is above MACD Signal Line (Bullish) but RSI \~ 50 (Neutral).

**OBV (On Balance Volume):**is flat, indicating that volume on Up days is equal to volume on Down days. Hence, demand from buyers and supply from sellers are in equilibrium

**Support and Resistance:** Nearest Support Zone is $50, then $40. The nearest Resistance Zone is $60, which it broke, then $75.

Facts dont ever need you to believe in them to be true and their shit doesnt add up. 


If you do any DD you'll have seen the top faces and outlets taking both sides on this like it's the swinging 60's.

Litecoin is going to drop 60-75%, litecoin is going to drop past 30 to mid 20's, they said. This unexpected pump comes along and suddenly they start parroting   what the little guys were saying out of speculation because they dont know why the price is jumping so sharply and they want to minimize their losses and avoid admitting they were wrong. 

We all have a stance and opinion on this but you need to be impartial at times like this and not let emotion speak or act for you. Subjectively should remain with the individual. Dont let someone yell at you what to think and, even worse, dont let anyone whisper what to think so you believe it was always your thoughts. 

The fact of the matter is crypto is as susceptible if not much more so to market manipulation than stocks are long since known to be. What's happening with litecoin right now has gone through the same PATTERN as it has in the past where it made upwards moves when BTC and crypto as a whole were going down. 

One of the most well known and obvious cases of market manipulation come from troll doll with that fresh implant fade tho ellen musk-rat. Hes done it several times with the company hes tried to rewrite reality to claim is his creation and that's why he was supposed to stop being able to tweet tween age shitposts all the time about said company and got in trouble for it. Trouble doesnt mean anything when you're the richest man in the world though so he didnt slow down even once but he did back pedal at the most convenient times every time. 

This matters because he incorporated crypto into Tesla and has been shilling for dogecoin ever since. Some of you have fallen so hard for his throat squirts so badly that you genuinely put doge as the #3 or even #2 crypto currency right now and in the future. 

Take a moment to step back and realize that doge pump and dumps are very structured and are the result of cause and effect by him. It's not a coincidence. His words have been so closely watched and believed that they alone moved markets no matter what he said. The pump comes right before the dump and the money they took from those they fooled gets pump to dumped right into another crypto. You dont get to be the greediest hoarder of wealth on the planet by making simple but huge mistakes and also getting lucky a bunch of times. 

Why is litecoin up 35% in one day when the rest of the market is down? They (crypto community) dont have the answer and neither do you but they're telling you that they do and it's the first thing that they can come up with or steal from someone else. The prediction that litecoin would drop below 30 hasnt and might not come true but it would have made sense if BTC dropped to 10k-13k. 

Litecoin being so high @60 while BTC is dipping its toesies into 15k already didnt make sense and neither does the formally tight price correlation between the two coins. The difference here is ~30% and while litecoin is UP 35% for the week, btc isnt even above water despite the 5% rise the same day. 

The other crypto billionaire in everyone's mouth is the same kind of con man. What happened with FTX and how he played a large role in it should have made headlines weeks ago. All he has to say now is that hes sorry and he gives nothing but bullshit excuses. 

His reasons don't make sense and more importantly, they don't fix anything. What his role in this is wasnt a mistake. What it does add up to flies in the face of what hes trying to convince you of. 
Litecoin jumping doesnt make any more sense either with the halving 9 months away.

I know there are some really strong believers in litecoin but ask yourself why you would choose a relatively high point to buy in when a plausible much lower low is predicted to be right around the corner based on recent events and now old predictions?

 It didnt happen at sub 50$ to mid 50$. It happened at low 60 and then low 70 all the way up to the next first doubt digit number change on the same exact day. All while all the signs said ltc should be down just like btc and the rest. 
Remember the fake news that was spread by only the biggest and most reputable news outlets and crypto sages about walmart accepting litecoin last year that led to a big market manipulated pump and dump? 

Who would have thought that someone(s) would intentionally lie to everyone in order to scam money from them before they could do anything to stop it? Simply unthinkable. Nobody could have predicted that.

Edit: I'd like to make it known that I've held litecoin for years and am also in the red. Being aware and realistic doesn't make me a shill or a hater. 



If you started a business and struggled for years then someone randomly comes to you offering you 8 figures would you not have suspicions or doubts? Mr. CBD.. 

Even the little guys have their own ulterior motives and are willing to be disillusioned and forcibly optimistic. You dont just get hired by Tyra banks off a snapchat post or win your ""rightful"" inheritance from a Nigerian prince. You're headed to a casting couch video and are about to be scammed out of your bank account holdings, baby. 

I didnt break the rules so you told me I broke the rules but wont elaborate or even answer. Was it because I talked about two of the biggest billionaire names in crypto or because you thought this might hamper your journey to profiting once you finally break even? You have much less of a chance of becoming besties with elon and having him give you all his money than you do winning the billions jackpot every year until you die, bub. 

Either way, I'm far from the only person who's had these doubts and went looking for answers. You have every right as an investor to not believe everything you read and demand an explanation. 

Never forget that the ultra wealthy increased their global hoard by 1,200,000,000,000$ since the pandemic because of them taking advantage of the majority just like this.","self","https://redd.it/z4ko24"

I work at a small investment management company and have been using this trading journal created by one of my IT co-workers in light and dark themes.

It lets me record and analyze the trades I take, and also helps me improve a trading strategy, comparing the trades by the criteria they meet and seeing what works best for me.

The template comes with instructions in pdf files that explain in detail how it works and you can find the answer to any question you may have about this journal.

My co-worker made it off-hours so he's cool about me sharing it.

But I am not a cultist. I prefer to view things from all angles, positive and negative. Since we've rehashed the positives, fundamentals and so on so many times, I'd like to discuss the negatives. Stuff gnawing at the back of my mind that I can't let go. So, litecoin:

\- What's the purpose?

The most common answer is digital money/currency. Alright, but unless it also starts being a solid deflationary store of value, I'm honestly not interested. Might just as well use fiat. What's the point? Why not fiat? Or whichever other crypto you like. Litecoin doesn't solve anything in this current scenario.

\- Charlie cashed out.

Not only that, he also allegedly wash-traded the btc/ltc pair whilst working at Coinbase before quitting his job and cashing out. Speculation: he used this as a way of getting more of his beloved bi tcoin. The price and ratio has never substantially surpassed his time at Coinbase. Yet he claims he 'doesn't know' why ltc's price doesn't take off.

\- Charlies advises people to get bi tcoin instead of litecoin.

No further elaboration needed.

\- Charlie said that if ltc hit 500 usd in 4 years (in year 2026) 'everyone would be happy'.

So that's the maximum price we're looking at? Ok, so not a store of value. Useful for trading, sure. But certainly not a store of value. Does't make me interested in it's selling point as 'digitcal currency', that's just bullshit. 

\- Shit price.

The price reached as high as 65 usd at the very very top in 2013. That's is the current price of ltc, basically a decade later. It even touched 40 usd during this past summer. 

\- Even more shit price when accounting for inflation.

No further elaboration needed.

\- Dying btc/ltc ratio.

The ratio's been dying since litecoins creation over a decade ago. The only argument people have is to 'play the btc/ltc ratio'. So they just want more bi tcoin. Then why the hell should I care about litecoin? There are other ratio plays available too.

\- Charlie did NOT remove conflict of interest.

He claims he sold litecoin to not be accused of pumping his own bags. Yet he still holds bi tcoin and shills those bags every chance he gets over litecoin. For litecoin, 'price doesn't matter'. There is certainly still conflict of interest as long as he's holding bi tcoin.

\- Whales playing games = all of crypto.

This means exchange coins are the ones that'll survive and thrive, besides bi tcoin and et h. And of course VC garbage pumps and dumps. Look at litecoin's trading volume. It's minute. The recent price increases/spikes are just whales trying to squeeze out exit liquidity to the last drop before dumping the price again. Not organic at all.

Discussion very welcome.","self","https://redd.it/zwc590"

The report also showed that litecoin, one of the major altcoins, has been gaining in popularity as means of payment at crypto payment platforms such as BitPay.

The research suggests that mainstream adoption of crypto payments is picking up pace as consumers increasingly use digital wallets and more merchants accept them. One of the cryptocurrencies that are becoming increasingly popular as means of payment among consumers and merchants is litecoin.

The altcoin offers advantages over bitcoin, such as faster settlement times and an ultra-low fee of just a penny, compared to the bitcoin fee of 30 cents. Pair said BitPay users use litecoin for everyday purchases and repeatable transactions of several hundred dollars, while bitcoin is more popular for larger purchases.

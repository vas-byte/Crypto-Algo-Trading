driving both crypto and traditional markets Turmoil in Kazakhstan highlights the importance of political stability for miners Survey reveals the top concern of institutional investors for digital assets Crypto Markets And Traditional Markets Fall on a Hawkish Fed On Wednesday at 2 PM the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its December FOMC meeting In the minutes there appeared an alarming consensus that the Fed should begin raising rates and shrinking the balance sheet as soon as possible once its taper is completed as anticipated in March 2022 This degree of hawkishness had already been communicated by the Fed in several forms and so it is perhaps surprising that investors had a strong reaction to the news Fed dot plots from that December meeting released immediately after the meeting showed an anticipated three rate hikes in 2022 Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in a speech soon after the December meeting that balance sheet reduction could start in 2022 But if the information was not entirely new investors were perhaps caught off guard by the forcefulness and level of consensus shown in the minutes Whats for certain is that investors quickly reacted sending many traditional financial markets as well as crypto down There did not appear to be any fundamental news in the crypto space and liquidations while elevated were not notable We have written extensively in recent months about the increasing relationship between crypto and traditional markets and so we will be keeping a close eye on the actions of the Federal Reserve going forward The next FOMC meeting is January 25th 26th and the next CPI reading is January 12th Hash Rates Fall Amid Kazakhstan Internet Shutdown In recent days Kazakhstan has faced significant protests sparked by the governments decision to lift price caps on fuel amid energy shortages leading to significant price increases Attempting to tame the protests the government shut down the internet In the wake of Chinas ban on mining a number of Chinese miners crossed the border into Kazakhstan Prior to the protests the nation controlled nearly 20 of the worlds hash rate Since bitcoin mining requires internet access to download blocks and transactions and propagate new blocks this effectively shut down mining in the country With the internet still down this provides a boon to miners outside of the country who are now more likely to win blocks and collect rewards Despite bitcoin being a supranational currency operations that support the network still occur within national boundaries Miners need energy internet and government approval to operate and the continued provision of these interrelated needs can be suddenly stopped in nations that lack stability When miners left China we believe that this improved the stability of the longterm Bitcoin network as well as its environmental profile If miners were to leave Kazakhstan to freer and steadier nations following the latest conflagration it would likely have a similar impact The episode also reinforced how vital it is that network hash rate is globally distributed rather than concentrated and exposed to the whims of a few governments Custody is Still the Top Institutional Investor Concern This week a survey from crypto asset manager Nickel Digital Asset Management highlighted the chief concern of institutional investors in the space asset custody The survey reported in the media said that 79 of respondents representing 1084B in assets under management cited secure storage of digital assets as the key consideration whether to invest in the space Our conversations with investors new to the industry echo similar concerns which stem from the core nature of Bitcoin itself Bitcoin is technology that removes trust from a central entity and places it in the hands of the network participants miners node operators and those that own bitcoin Bitcoin has been called a digital bearer instrument which to us means that whoever possesses the private key the password that allows one to move bitcoins has the right to the asset itself Given this technological innovation it should come as no surprise that institutional investors are concerned with the safeguarding of their private keys While counterparty risks exist in the traditional markets something that was on full display during the Global Financial Crisis losing your securities or having them stolen is not a threat historically borne by traditional market investors We understand the concern and therefore encourage those entering the space to perform adequate due diligence on service providers It is just as important as the investment analysis itself Market Update market datajpg Bitcoin fell 84 with much of the losses occurring on the back of the hawkish FOMC meeting

my ongoing crypto audit This is long This applies ONLY to the US Disclaimer This is MY Experience No doubt there are others who know better This is advice from someone who really fucked up and is paying dearly for that Dont be ME Crypto was new in 2017 I did a lot of poorly though out and kind of reckless beyond sense things with bitcoin Etherium ICOs and every other shitcoin available at the time The TLDR is you better have ALL of your details Going back to your first trade You are NOT smarter than the IRS Some quick background This audit is on my 2017 taxes I received a request for backup information that was due on August 26th 2019 I went through my records and reconstructed everything I could find I knew i was missing somebut I did not think it would matter Silly me Of course I waited until the last minute to do the work I had a couple other things on my mind It just so happened that August 26 was the day of my wifes Whipple Surgery for pancreatic cancer and it was the day my mom died after being in hospice for 3 weeks Literally the worst day of my life Needless to say I effed up the reply and that triggered a real anal probe of a review My review indicated I should get a 5 figure refund And they paid it Then they looked closer Boywas I wrong The amount of detail they have gone into over the past two year has been amazing I discovered I was using incorrect thinking about cost basis And when I realized that I knew I was screwed I have been fully cooperatingwhich is good because they are going to be quick to play the evasion card I actually paid a big bill going into the review to acknowledge I screwed up They got paid back their refundand then a lot They went through every transaction on my Coinbase Trezor Gateio Bittrex and a couple of MEW wallets Ever From the first day I traded bitcoin in May 2013 Every move every buy every sale Now keep in mind we are talking the big run of 2017 BCH drops ETH trades and a bunch of ICOs There are about 1400 transactions but then you need to account for every move OUT of one wallet to another If you can tie them together there is no impact But if you sent stuff out to other addresses and you cannot identify it and establish where it wasits a sale So here is how its going After two years and some pretty intense discussions all of it amicable it has come to pass that the IRS has engaged a third party vendor they use to calculate cost basis and capital gains This third party will take the ledger files of all of your wallets and combine them into a single transaction list They will calculate your cost basis and taxable income The IRS will present this to me Then we can discuss Now here are some important things to note I had two Bitcoin Q wallets large and small at the very start of my BTC life One I called the large wallet The other the small wallet One had a couple of large deposits from bulk buys and sales Not a big deal I actually had those records It took a week to download the blockchainbut I ended up with the detail The small wallet had hundreds of small transactions When I got my trezor I moved everything to the trezor and never gave this small wallet any thought It now sits on a broken hard drive or lost USB drive Ive torn my home apart looking for it That stupid little wallet is going to be the death of me There are no coins in the wallet but there ARE hundreds of transfers all around to and from the wallet that I cannot prove Obviously tying a sale to a specific purchase is easy You subtract one from the otherand the difference is your gain or loss Easy Peasy Just make sure you can do that and account for every single move you have every made in your crypto life Every time I sent something out of the wallet and I cannot tie to a real sale or an exchange for good like a financial Report is considered a sale That taxable income is based on the cost basisand these little sales will change every cost basis from 2016 to 2022 It screws up thousands of transactions Every time you get bitcoin or any other crypto coming into your account and you cannot account for the purchase it is assumed that the income crypto is INCOME And that is the cost of the unit for your cost basis Those two things added up to tens of thousands in capital gains AND income they say havent been reported Weve whittled away at that numberbut its still bigger than I want it to be Throughout the process I have been asked such rookie questions such as When you move crypto from wallet to wallet in a Trezor do you pay a commission or pay a network fee Scary huh My point is that some of the people you will be dealing with have little or no experience with this process Years ago I was audited for a small business and at least the examiner and I spoke the same languagewe might have have disagreed but at least I understood where he was coming fromand he knew what I was saying No so with Crypto They have specialists who are always in training Listen to what they asking to verify that its even correct My examiner and I actually had some laughs over their crypto ignorance Its like laughing with the Lion about to eat you Sothese guys are backed up against the wall I signed two extensionssome lasting a year because they were backed up with cases And these are the examinersnot the folks doing to tax return back ups Part of this is because they NEED to give you six months after your findings to appeal And you need at least a full year of active examination for the appeal to proceed They dont have the staff and they dont have the time to do this stuff swiftly The downside to that is if they are up against the wall they will go with their first blushand that was really really wrong Since I know I am screwed and I paid more of what I am going to oweI signed And now this can go until Dec 2022 But my advice for everyone is to do the following Its not what you know or think about what you didits about what you can prove Print out the account report for ALL of your exchanges All of your exchanges going back to your first transaction Put them in a safe place Print out the history of each of your wallets Even if you think no one will ever find it They will List out everything youve bought with bitcoin Because that purchase price is going to be a sale If you sent it to an addressthey are going to identify that address When I did my report I just said I bought gold or financial reports with it The gold I have receipts for The financial reportsnot so much They havent pressed me on that stuff because they were minor The ICOs bought were a pain in the ass because a lot of them were on MetaMask and it would take a fortune to go back rebuild those I kept pretty good records of the follow on sales so that wont be horrible But I would have loved to have the records If you did any kiosk and peer to peer exchanges they will want the details Names Dates etc As best you can tie one transaction to the next in a daisy chain They understand network fees so if you can show you sent 2 of this to a wallet and then sent it to another walletthey understand that But you have to be able to tie them together and prove it This is tough when you aggregate in an off line wallet and then send them to a single address to sell If you did a lot of trading say on Coinbase and Robinhood it can be maddening Do no lie to them Never use NEVER or ALWAYS when describing anything to them Do not ignore their letters They dont ask multiple times They will write a couple of times Then it will come certified mail Then they will toss a lien on your bank account and house THAT did not happen but Ive heard stories I cannot tell you how many times Ive told them I think thats itand then i found a place where I did four or five oneoff transactions that cleared up about 6k in taxable transactions which was good But I had to go back and say look what I found On a couple occasions theyve come back and said What was thiswe cannot find it anywhere else It looks like it went to Fill in the blank exchange And there I am standing with my pants down I had no memory of making that transaction 5 years ago If you are using a third party vendor to assess transactions make sure you include ALL of your wallets and all moves transfers and transactions since Day 1 Do not assume if you are using a Trezor for some stuff a Ledger for another and Coinbase for other stuff that simply linking your API to Coinbase is going to be good enough Its not They want it all Even though their examination will be for a specific yearthey will ask to see cost basis In my case they cannot go back further to taxable income because the statute time has lapsed But the cost basis they come up with will affect hundreds of transactions from 2017 through 2022 They will expect a refile of transactions for those tax years Even this year their finding will likely impact the cost basis for some crypto traded in 2021 This means I get an extension now or I will literally have to refile in May or June The tiny good news is that during this process I found residual tidbits of ETH and Bitcoin in a few small wallets Was amounted to 5 in 2017 is considerably more today So I was able to pick up a couple hundred dollars LOL The process has been frustrating maddening and enlightening The examining agent and I have become friendly They are wonderful people working for an entirely inept bureaucracy While I have gotten my digs in here and there I guess I have been worn down to being a compliant worker bee You are not smarter than the IRS If you watched Ozark and think you can move money around in the US without them seeing it or finding ityou are wrong Dont try doing that Dont lie If you are in this situation suck it up and deal with them Get help if you need it DO NOTLIE They will come at younot this year but in 1 to 2 years or later They are that backed up They will ask for a whole range of detail If you do not provide it with cross references or updates they will nail you That is where it becomes scary If anyone lives in the US and they find you have done any dealing in Crypto and you do not check the box on the Tax form they will come down hard on you Dont do that They told me that is the first thing they will cross reference So after two years Ive finally submitted every note spreadsheet download or report that I can find displaying my crypto history There are no more Merlin Cryto secrets They have it all Its up to their Wizards They will come back with a number that I can negotiate dispute or appeal I am pretty sure I wont have the money or inclination to fight this further I can pay their fine get Jussied out of IRS jail and get on with my life When someone in your family has PC you do not dwell on shit Even when its been gone for two years The only thing that makes me smile is the knowledge that somewhere there are a bunch of college kids who made 50k in Dogecoin last year Or Shiba And they either blew it on Spring Break or they tried to hide it They watch too much Ozark And these kids are going to have to claim that revenue on their Taxes their parents taxes and their FAFSA Financial Aid will get dropped And parents will be on the hook for their kids taxesAND their own modest tax rate could get bumped up to another rate That might be fun to watch as I emerge on the other end of the IRS colon My best advice is be very careful Be honest And be prepared to show you workjust like a 7th grade algebra test If you have any questions let me know I will do my best to answer them Butevery case is different,Positive,0.9963

like Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than all of Argentina or Bitcoin mining uses more energy than all of Google operations Claims that will earn the raising of eyebrows but fail to address the fundamental question is the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining is worth the benefits This question should be broken down into two aspects energy consumption and hardware churn The energy used by Bitcoin miners does three powerful things Energy consumption 1Secures all the wealth stored on the Bitcoin network in a decentralized state Most current financial systems are controlled by a centralized entity banks credit unions federal reserve etc This means that those central parties can manipulate funds stop transactions or do whatever they feel is in the best interest of whatever source of power is pushing them to act For example Canada recently confiscated funds that were donated to a protesting group they did not agree with Banks credit unions GoFundMe and many other entities were asked to freeze accounts stop payments or take action in some way to prevent funding the protesters Because Bitcoin has no single point of control flexing this level of power is not possible whether youre an individual or a sovereign nation 2Creates a financial incentive that promotes renewable energy sources Bitcoin mining has become a profitable industry for many companies One major expense mining companies face is energy costs What is the cheapest energy longterm You guessed it renewables There is a builtin financial incentive to acquire the cheapest energy for these forprofit companies which means every mining company will seek out integrating renewable energies as part of their operational setup With greater demand for renewables renewable companies will allocate more funds for research and development to improve wind solar and hydro technologies to better fulfill the added market demand Coming full circle Bitcoin mining is not only promoting the adoption but also the improvement of renewable energy technology 3Provides stability to unstable power grids An interesting aspect of Bitcoin mining is the ability for miners to be turned on or off ad hoc without affecting operational infrastructure unlike cement steel or any other industrial entity Because of this we are seeing grid operators partnering with mining facilities to best make use of the energy grids In Texas there was a recent overload on the power grid when a freeze came through and every household had to turn off their heater With the amount of energy needed to sustain every business and household the energy grid was at a near collapse and rolling blackouts were pushed to keep the grid intact Since the freeze the grid has been expanding with added renewables and with miners leveraging much of the excess or unused energy In the event of another freeze where the household energy consumption is expected to spike the energy companies would pay the mining companies to turn off a portion of their Bitcoin miners to free up the needed energy supply to the grid Once the household load subsides the Bitcoin miners can be turned back on utilizing the freedup excess energy Hardware Churn The physical lifespan of a current ASIC applicationspecific integrated circuit miner is between 23 years Financial lifespan will have a broader range depending on multiple factors such as cost of energy usage when the miner comes online the hash rate growth of the network and what the Bitcoin price does during the miners lifespan Another factor thats had a significant impact on mining is the rate at which hardware technology has evolved specifically for ASIC miners As soon as a new miner is released there is a stronger and more efficient miner right around the corner This has led to a lot of churn with largescale mining operations quickly retiring old miners and replacing them with new ones Given that Bitcoin mining is still relatively new especially from a commercialization view mining technology is evolving at a rapid rate which means if you are in the business of mining for profit youll likely continue purchasing the new mining rigs to keep your financial returns competitive with your peers This leaves many older mining rigs in a position of no mans land where they cant return profits worth their operational costs and they cant be repurposed for any other use I believe this is the most valid critique of Bitcoin mining but one that can hopefully be addressed in the near future There have been a few ideas floating around such as integrating retired miners with new home energy builds to help offset energy costs while maintaining the Bitcoin network or building miners in a way where once they are decommissioned they can be better stripped to have their components repurposed Either way hardware churn is a top concern of the Bitcoin community and is likely to be addressed as more hardware manufacturers enter the space In Summary Bitcoin mining is a waste of energy This critique is COMPLICATED On one hand the energy Bitcoin consumes is used to secure all of the stored wealth in a decentralized state provides stability to power grids and promote renewable energy development and implementation On the other hand the physical miners are often replaced frequently with no real repurposable utility for the retired miners,Positive,0.9994

Everyone Bitcoins been catching a lot of heat lately over its energy consumption Article after article comes out that decry its harm to the environment But the truth is far more comforting than a handful of seemingly harsh data points about Bitcoin and the environment I wanted to create this post to equip every miner and Bitcoiner with the arguments they need to spread the truth about Bitcoins impact on the environment How could such an energyconsuming technology benefit the Green Movement In short theres more to Bitcoin than its critics appreciate Bitcoin mining renders renewable energy sources viable In April 2021 Jack Dorseys Square released a white paper boldly titled Bitcoin is Key to an Abundant Clean Energy Future Early in the memo the authors explained that the costs for solar and wind energy have recently dropped by 90 and 71 respectively Suffice to say that green alternatives are rapidly gaining steam on the cost side of the ledger But as explained above its difficult to match supply of solar and wind energy to demand Demand for energy peaks in the early evening when people are home and using appliances At that time though the sun is already setting and wind is always unpredictable Enter Bitcoin mining Miners can work from anywhere so long as theyre connected to a power source and the internet Because of this they can act as an energy buyer of last resort whenever supply of wind or solar exceeds demand miners can jump in and pay for the privilege of using the energy to mine Bitcoin This will render renewable energy far more profitable and will therefore incentivize the creation of more green energy sources Squares white paper puts it succinctly Bitcoin minersoffer highly flexible and easily interruptible loadand are completely location agnostic requiring only an internet connection They are an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moments notice anywhere in the world Bitcoin is one of the cleanest industries on the planet In 2021 the Bitcoin Mining Council BMC published the results of a voluntary survey that investigated the electricity consumption and sustainable power mix of about onethird of the Bitcoin network They discovered that those surveyed used electricity fed by 67 sustainable power The surveyors inferred that the entire Bitcoin networks sustainable electricity mix had increased to 56 making it among the greenest industries in the world In contrast electricity in the United States is only 305 sustainable and electricity in China is less than 15 sustainable Bitcoin mining employs energy that wouldve otherwise gone to waste As Caitlin Long CEO of Avanti Financial Group said in a recent documentary More than 23 of the energy produced in the world is waste energy because its produced during the hours of the day when theres not demand to consume itits also produced in a place where theres not transmission to move it across space and time and so that energy goes unused and wasted Crusoe Energy and others are tackling this issue with bitcoin Mining The company raised 128 million dollars in 2021 to build data centers and Bitcoin mining operations that use this wasted energy and reduce methane emissions Crusoe Energy operates out of North Dakota where 500 million cubic feet of gas are flared daily The company runs forty data centers that harness flared natural gas as of 2021 Soon they expect to operate 100 units across six states Cofounder of Crusoe Energy Lochmiller said that Where we view our power consumption we draw a very clear line in our project evaluation stage where were reducing emissions foroil and gas projects Energy consumption drives progress and so doesnt require defending Professor Vaclav Smils Energy and Civilization A History traces the relationship between energy consumption and human progress To take one example he explains that a typical 1900 Great Plains farmer employed at most 5 kilowatts of power to plow his field using horses In 2000 a farmer couple can employ over 250 kilowatts of power with a diesel engine all while sitting high above the ground in the airconditioned comfort of his tractor cabin Smils thesis aligns with our common sense There is a reason that modern cities consume more energy than ancient villages that airplanes consume more energy than horses and that calculators consume more energy than abacuses Seen in this light even if Bitcoin was the most energyintensive money ever invented that does not mean that we should continue using gold and fiat currencies A more comprehensive comparison should compare all of the costs and benefits conferred on humanity by each money To critics of Bitcoin who appeal to its energy consumption I ask why is environmental impact the standard by which you judge an innovation rather than the benefit said innovation would confer on humanity If you are interested in ways of pushing this movement and have more questions regarding changing the current paradigm around Bitcoin mining and the environment Sazmining a renewable energy Bitcoin mining venture is hosting an AMA today at 1 pm ET Their AMAs are super interesting to listen to and they love to get questions from fellow miners and Bitcoiners,Positive,0.9992

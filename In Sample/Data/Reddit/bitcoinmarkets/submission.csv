&nbsp;

Hey everyone! I wanted to share an early look at a web app I've been developing these past few months called DCA Stack (Dollar Cost Averaging Stack). DCA Stack is an automated dollar collar cost averaging bot that can purchase bitcoin (and altcoins) on over 100 exchanges. Did I also mention that this is **completely free** to use?

&nbsp;

I built this because I was fed up how difficult it was to Dollar Cost Average. I wanted to use my favorite exchanges but found that they had outrageous fees for the recurring buy option. The only options after that were costly services that would automate DCA or placing them manually like a peasant. I figured there had to be a better way so I put some weekends into developing this web app to restore everyone's purchasing power.

&nbsp;

It's still a super early release of DCA Stack but it's functional. I'd love to gather the community's feedback, thoughts and concerns so I can make this even better for everyone.

&nbsp;

EDIT: Just wanted to address one crucial detail on how this bot operates. It works by API keys generated on the user's exchange of choice. It needs the ability to place orders and view account balances. These permissions will allow it to place orders and display the portfolio dashboard. We will NEVER need withdrawal permissions. That is not necessary and should NEVER be allowed on crypto bots or in general for third party websites.

EDIT 2: Just wanted to thank everyone for their feedback! I love all the issues the community has raised and totally understand the hesitancy with API keys. Thank you everyone so much for the wonderful criticism!","self","https://redd.it/ruar8a"

I'd love to know what the sentiment to this analysis is right now. What do you think? Is this prediction correct? Are we having a spring phase or a secondary test right now? Will we stay range bound above 40k?

Personally, I stick to my predictions so I hedged (shorted) part of my portfolio at 52k and gradually unhedged my short positions down to 42k.

I can see how much fear and bearish sentiment we're having right now and that's making me believe we've hit the bottom soon. Most of retail has left and institutions have little supply to accumulate.","self","https://redd.it/ry3ude"

It was removed because it mentions ""shitcoins"".  I'm not sure how that subreddit can pretend to have any meaningful discourse while simultaneously labeling everything else in the cryptocurrency industry as a ""shitcoin"".  To me it further shows that Bitcoin investors are using more of a faith-based approach versus a pragmatic approach.**  

I'd like to outline my thesis on Bitcoin for 2022 and beyond. I have been involved in BTC for a long time and I have been very bullish on the network in the past. However, I don't believe in falling in love with an asset. I believe in constantly reviewing your thesis, since the industry and environment are highly dynamic.

So, here are my criticisms on BTC and why I think it will underperform in the short/mid term:

* Bitcoin Network lacks the maneuverability to implement changes & new technology. This is for several reasons.  

   * First, the network's strength is its longevity and security. We are very careful for any modifications we make to the network as a whole, because we worry that any change could bring in a vulnerability. For that reason, BTC network is very slow to implement updates and changes tend to be very minor.
   * Second, BTC is decentralized and has no specific organization cemented as leaders. Therefore, simple changes are often disputed and have even resulted in forking the community. The creator of BTC is an anonymous person who hasn't appeared in a decade. Therefore, there is no voice of leadership, which could provide concrete direction.
   * Third, Bitcoin was of course the first network ever launched. Therefore, it is based on the most simple, albeit functional, technology. It lacks smart contract support and requires a second layer for any type of feasible scaling.
* Lightning Network has been too slow to gain adoption. Competing networks have already leapfrogged Bitcoin in terms of second layer solutions and real usage.  

   * We cannot deny that Ethereum has made big strides on their implementation of Layer 2 technology. There are multiple forms of layer 2's which are all competing and building out projects. ZK-rollups, optimistic rollups, hybrid solutions. I went to a talk on Lightning Network in 2015. Today, it's still very under-utilized.
* Blockchain Payments are better solved with stablecoins.  

   * Like it or not, BTC and other floating value cryptocurrencies are volatile. Volatility is the enemy of currency. Currency is meant to be stable, the price of an item should not change within 10 minutes of making a purchase. Commerce is still overwhelmingly done in USD and other fiat currencies. Adding a secondary currency to the mix simply complicates transactions. Further, BTC's high value creates awkward payment amounts which are difficult to understand at a quick glance. For example, it's very confusing to convert 0.000025 BTC to USD. It's much easier to convert something like 100,000 VND to USD, even though it has similarly high digits.
   * Stablecoins are quickly displacing BTC and other cryptocurrencies in payments. This trend is not showing any sign of deceleration.
   * Please spare me the inflation argument. Inflation in the USD was very low over the past decade. It is obviously much higher today, but the Fed is reacting and controlling inflation is part of their mandate. Further, 5% or even 10% inflation isn't enough to justify BTC price hitting $100K or beyond.
* Confirmations are too slow for payments  

   * Payments need to be verified near-instantaneously. It is not acceptable to wait 10+ minutes for 1 confirmation.
* BTC's primary function is as a store of value. Its value is derived from scarcity and demand. When it was the only game in town, and when it was the only project anyone was using, that was enough. However, today there are projects gaining major traction, all of which offer similar forms of scarcity. Digital scarcity is constant in some form throughout the industry. Therefore, it is not enough to warrant being the top project by itself.
* Other projects are showing up with real useful technology. DeFi seems most relevant at the moment. Blockchain gaming seems to be gaining traction as well. NFT's are very hype-y but long term, their application outside the art world has great potential. BTC has no way to really get involved with these new use cases. It is pigeon holed into payments / single asset network.

So there you have it. I'm sure you'll be tempted to tell me I'm an asshole, since you are probably a BTC investor. But I'd really love to hear your critical responses to my concerns. I would love to see Bitcoin succeed and continue to dominate the market. I just don't see how to get excited about the project as it is today, especially compared to its peers.","self","https://redd.it/ry9o8y"

Crypto Markets (And Traditional Markets) Fall on a Hawkish Fed
On Wednesday at 2 PM, the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its December FOMC meeting. In the minutes, there appeared an alarming consensus that the Fed should begin raising rates and shrinking the balance sheet as soon as possible once its taper is completed as anticipated in March 2022. This degree of hawkishness had already been communicated by the Fed in several forms, and so it is perhaps surprising that investors had a strong reaction to the news. Fed dot plots from that December meeting, released immediately after the meeting, showed an anticipated three rate hikes in 2022. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in a speech soon after the December meeting that balance sheet reduction could start in 2022. But if the information was not entirely new, investors were perhaps caught off guard by the forcefulness and level of consensus shown in the minutes. What's for certain is that investors quickly reacted, sending many traditional financial markets, as well as crypto, down.

There did not appear to be any fundamental news in the crypto space and liquidations, while elevated, were not notable. We have written extensively in recent months about the increasing relationship between crypto and traditional markets, and so we will be keeping a close eye on the actions of the Federal Reserve going forward. The next FOMC meeting is January 25th - 26th and the next CPI reading is January 12th.
 
Hash Rates Fall Amid Kazakhstan Internet Shutdown
In recent days, Kazakhstan has faced significant protests, sparked by the government’s decision to lift price caps on fuel amid energy shortages, leading to significant price increases. Attempting to tame the protests, the government shut down the internet. In the wake of China’s ban on mining, a number of Chinese miners crossed the border into Kazakhstan. Prior to the protests, the nation controlled nearly 20% of the world’s hash rate. Since bitcoin mining requires internet access to download blocks and transactions and propagate new blocks, this effectively shut down mining in the country. With the internet still down, this provides a boon to miners outside of the country who are now more likely to win blocks and collect rewards.
 
Despite bitcoin being a supranational currency, operations that support the network still occur within national boundaries. Miners need energy, internet, and government approval to operate, and the continued provision of these interrelated needs can be suddenly stopped in nations that lack stability. When miners left China, we believe that this improved the stability of the long-term Bitcoin network (as well as its environmental profile). If miners were to leave Kazakhstan to freer and steadier nations following the latest conflagration, it would likely have a similar impact. The episode also reinforced how vital it is that network hash rate is globally distributed rather than concentrated and exposed to the whims of a few governments.
 
Custody is Still the Top Institutional Investor Concern
This week, a survey from crypto asset manager Nickel Digital Asset Management highlighted the chief concern of institutional investors in the space, asset custody. The survey, reported in the media, said that 79% of respondents representing $108.4B in assets under management cited secure storage of digital assets as the key consideration whether to invest in the space. Our conversations with investors new to the industry echo similar concerns, which stem from the core nature of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is technology that removes trust from a central entity and places it in the hands of the network participants: miners, node operators, and those that own bitcoin. Bitcoin has been called a “digital bearer instrument”, which to us means that whoever possesses the private key, the password that allows one to move bitcoins, has the right to the asset itself. Given this technological innovation, it should come as no surprise that institutional investors are concerned with the safeguarding of their private keys. While counterparty risks exist in the traditional markets, something that was on full display during the Global Financial Crisis, losing your securities or having them stolen is not a threat historically borne by traditional market investors. We understand the concern and therefore encourage those entering the space to perform adequate due diligence on service providers. It is just as important as the investment analysis itself.

I'm really looking for bull-thesis to support the idea we hold the line around $41K. But I just ... am getting more pessimistic based on my results below.

BTC is mirroring the change in real rate yields of 10-year bonds. The 10 year negative rate rose from -1.17 to -0.73 and BTC fell from \~68,000 to $41,800 so far....an almost exact match of about 37.6% and 38% respectively. 10-year nominal rates are expected to reach 2% to 2.25% which - while inflation remains high (assuming it doesn't change at all) will put the real rate yields near -0.49 to -0.24.  Worst case scenario that we can predict is -1.17 to -0.24 or about 20.5% meaning BTC can reach $13,940 down from $68,000. 

I ran the numbers for February 2021 lowest rate and March 2021 highest rate, and correlated it to the drop in price as well.

Real rate yields changed 53.7% and BTC changed 48.1%.

I don't know why the timing was skewed but I figured it might have to do with massive FOMO and retailers and exuberance.

The latest rally was more sobering and concentrated to professionals so it dropped more timely and more precisely.","self","https://redd.it/ryk657"

&#x200B;

We all know shorts move much faster than longs (""the red waterfall""). But recently I realized that even my otherwise quite successful longs algo, when applied to shorts, give significantly poorer results. And it's not about the period of time when it is applied. Even in periods of huge crashes, it can not enter on time and misses the drop.

&#x200B;

So I was wondering if any of you uses different approach/algo/system for shorts than for longs? Usually every strategy is defined for shorts and longs just the opposite way. But I am not sure anymore this is the best advice.

Now the break-even price for this call assuming I count my ~~profits~~ returns in BTC is around 45k (40k would give me 0.5 BTC) which sucks big time because basically upside is limited (0.45 BTC if BTCUSD -> infinity) and the strike price and break even are miles away from each other.

So what would be the best way to benefit from a mini-bull  (say factor 3) on a 1 year timeframe? (I'll calculate it myself later anyway but I want to make sure my math is right and get your input on where the solution should be)

I found altrady, which ties into the Kucoin API, but wondering if there might be any other options out there I'm missing. I don't care about charting, simply want a less wonky level 2 trading interface, faster trade execution options via smart keystrokes and better level 2 layout / options like you would get with a typical daytrading level 2 setup.

I understand that long-term it might be better to just hodl, but I'd love to make some short-term profit while I'm waiting. The little bit of research I did led me to the idea of using a grid trading bot.

It seems that grid trading bots do well in bullish markets, but not so much in bearish ones. Now that the trend appears to be shifting with bitcoin, it might be a good time to try one of these bots out. I came across Pionex, which is an exchange with an integrated grid trading bot. It seems like an accessible way for me to explore this approach.

As more experienced traders, what do you think of this idea? What do I need to look out for? Any thoughts you can offer me will help. Thanks!","self","https://redd.it/sletqh"

Fir Tree Capital Management is making a substantial short wager on Tether, the stablecoin that’s under intense scrutiny from regulators.

The $4 billion hedge fund, founded by Jeff Tannenbaum, constructed a way to short Tether in an asymmetric trade, meaning the downside risk is small and potential to make money is great, according to clients of the firm. That’s a feat that other firms have struggled to figure out.

Fir Tree is betting that its short wager could see a payday within 12 months and its thesis against Tether centers around the coin’s roughly $24 billion in high-yield commercial paper, much of it the firm believes is tied to Chinese real estate developers.

Fir Tree started looking at shorting Tether in July, and did research including hiring third-party experts, the investors said. It is considering setting up a separate fund for the sole purpose of shorting Tether if there is enough client interest.","self","https://redd.it/tbrnbp"

This applies ONLY to the US.

Disclaimer:

This is MY Experience.  No doubt there are others who know better.  This is advice from someone who really fucked up and is paying dearly for that.  Don't be ME.  Crypto was new in 2017.  I did a lot of poorly though out and kind of ""reckless beyond sense"" things with bitcoin, Etherium, ICOs and every other shitcoin available at the time.

**The TL/DR is, you better have ALL of your details.  Going back to your first trade.  You are NOT smarter than the IRS.**

\-------------------

 Some quick background: 

This audit is on my 2017 taxes.  I received a request for back-up information that was due on August 26th 2019.  I went through my records and reconstructed everything I could find.  I knew i was missing some...but I did not think it would matter.  Silly me.

Of course I waited until the last minute to do the work.  I had a couple other things on my mind.

It just so happened that August 26 was the day of my wife's Whipple Surgery for pancreatic cancer and it was the day my mom died after being in hospice for 3 weeks.  Literally, the worst day of my life.

Needless to say, I ""effed"" up the reply and that triggered a real anal probe of a review.  My review indicated I should get a 5 figure refund.  And they paid it. 

Then, they looked closer.  Boy...was I wrong.

 The amount of detail they have gone into over the past two year has been amazing.  I discovered I was using incorrect thinking about cost basis.  And when I realized that, I knew I was screwed. 

 I have been fully cooperating--which is good because they are going to be quick to play the ""evasion"" card.  I actually paid a big bill going into the review to acknowledge I screwed up.  They got paid back their refund...and then a lot.

 They went through every transaction on my Coinbase, Trezor, [Gate.io](https://Gate.io), Bittrex, and a couple of MEW wallets.  Ever.  From the first day I traded bitcoin in May 2013. 

Every move, every buy, every sale.  Now, keep in mind we are talking the big run of 2017, BCH drops, ETH trades and a bunch of ICOs.  There are about 1400 transactions, but then you need to account for every move OUT of one wallet to another.  If you can tie them together, there is no impact.  But if you sent stuff out to other addresses and you cannot identify it and establish where it was...its a sale.

 So, here is how its going.  After two years and some pretty intense discussions (all of it amicable), it has come to pass that the IRS has engaged a third party vendor they use to calculate cost basis and capital gains.  This third party will take the ledger files of all of your wallets and combine them into a single transaction list.  They will calculate your cost basis and taxable income.  The IRS will present this to me.  Then we can ""discuss.""

 Now, here are some important things to note:  I had two Bitcoin Q wallets (large and small.) at the very start of my BTC life.  One I called the ""large"" wallet.  The other the small wallet.  One had a couple of large deposits from bulk buys and sales.  Not a big deal.  I actually had those records.  It took a week to download the blockchain...but I ended up with the detail.

The ""small"" wallet had hundreds of small transactions.  When I got my trezor, I moved everything to the trezor and never gave this ""small"" wallet any thought.  It now sits on a broken hard drive or lost USB drive.  I've torn my home apart looking for it.  That stupid little wallet is going to be the death of me.  There are no coins in the wallet, but there ARE hundreds of transfers all around to and from the wallet that I cannot ""prove.""

Obviously, tying a sale to a specific purchase is easy.  You subtract one from the other...and the difference is your gain or loss.  Easy Peasy.  Just make sure you can do that and account for every single move you have every made in your crypto life.

**Every time I sent something out of the wallet and I cannot tie to a real sale, or an exchange for good (like a financial Report) is considered a sale.** That taxable income is based on the cost basis--and these little sales will change every cost basis from 2016 to 2022.  It screws up thousands of transactions. 

**Every time you get bitcoin or any other crypto coming into your account and you cannot account for the purchase, it is assumed that the income crypto is INCOME.**  And that is the cost of the unit for your cost basis.

Those two things added up to tens of thousands in ""capital gains"" AND ""income"" they say haven't been reported.  We've whittled away at that number....but its still bigger than I want it to be.

Throughout the process I have been asked such ""rookie"" questions such as, ""When you move crypto from wallet to wallet in a Trezor, do you pay a commission or pay a network fee?""  Scary, huh?

My point is that some of the people you will be dealing with have little or no experience with this process.  Years ago I was audited for a small business and at least the examiner and I ""spoke"" the same language--we might have have disagreed, but at least I understood where he was coming from--and he knew what I was saying.  No so with Crypto.  They have specialists who are always in training.  Listen to what they asking to verify that its even ""correct.""  My examiner and I actually had some laughs over their ""crypto ignorance.""

Its like laughing with the Lion about to eat you.

 So...these guys are backed up against the wall.  I signed two extensions--some lasting a year because they were backed up with cases.  And these are the examiners--not the folks doing to tax return back ups. 

Part of this is because they NEED to give you six months after your findings to appeal.  And you need at least a full year of ""active examination"" for the appeal to proceed.  They don’t have the staff and they don’t have the time to do this stuff swiftly. 

The downside to that is if they are up against the wall, they will go with their first blush—and that was really, really wrong.

 Since I know I am screwed, and I paid more of what I am going to owe...I signed.  And now this can go until Dec 2022. 

 But, my advice for everyone is to do the following:

**Its not what you know, or think about what you did...its about what you can prove.**

 Print out the account report for ALL of your exchanges.  All of your exchanges going back to your first transaction.  Put them in a safe place.

 Print out the history of each of your wallets.  Even if you think no one will ever find it.  They will.

 List out everything you've bought with bitcoin.  Because that purchase price is going to be a sale.  If you sent it to an address...they are going to identify that address.  When I did my report I just said I bought ""gold"" or financial reports with it.  The gold I have receipts for.  The financial reports...not so much.  They haven't pressed me on  that stuff because they were minor.

 The ICOs bought were a pain in the ass because a lot of them were on MetaMask and it would take a fortune to go back rebuild those.  I kept pretty good records of the follow on sales, so that won't be horrible.  But I would have loved to have the records.

 If you did any kiosk and peer to peer exchanges, they will want the details.  Names, Dates, etc.

As best you can, tie one transaction to the next in a daisy chain.  They understand network fees so if you can show you sent 2 of this to a wallet, and then sent it to another wallet..they understand that.  But you have to be able to tie them together and prove it.  This is tough when you aggregate in an off line wallet, and then send them to a single address to sell.

If you did a lot of trading (say on Coinbase and Robinhood) it can be maddening.

 **Do no lie to them.   Never use NEVER or ALWAYS when describing anything to them.**

**Do not ignore their letters.  They don't ""ask"" multiple times.  They will write a couple of times.  Then it will come certified mail.  Then they will toss a lien on your bank account and house.  (THAT did not happen, but I've heard stories.)**

I cannot tell you how many times I've told them, ""I think that's it""...and then i found a place where I did four or five ""one-off"" transactions that cleared up about $6k in taxable transactions (which was good.)  But, I had to go back and say, ""look what I found.""  On a couple occasions they've come back and said, ""What was this...we cannot find it anywhere else.  It looks like it went to ‘”Fill in the blank exchange.”  And there I am standing with my pants down.  I had no memory of making that transaction 5 years ago.

 If  you are using a third party vendor to assess transactions, make sure you include ALL of your wallets and all moves, transfers, and transactions since Day 1.  Do not assume if you are using a Trezor for some stuff, a Ledger for another, and Coinbase for other stuff that simply linking your API to Coinbase is going to be good enough.  Its not.  They want it all.

Even though their examination will be for a specific year...they will ask to see cost basis.  In my case they cannot go back further to taxable income because the statute time has lapsed.  But, the ""cost basis"" they come up with will affect hundreds of transactions from 2017 through 2022.

They will expect a ""re-file"" of transactions for those tax years.  Even this year, their finding will likely impact the cost basis for some crypto traded in 2021.  This means I get an extension now or I will literally have to refile in May or June.

 The tiny good news is that during this process I found residual tidbits of ETH and Bitcoin in a few small wallets.  Was amounted to $5 in 2017 is considerably more today.  So I was able to pick up a couple hundred dollars. LOL

 The process has been frustrating, maddening, and enlightening.  The examining agent and I have become ""friendly.""  They are wonderful people working for an entirely inept bureaucracy.  While I have gotten my digs in here and there, I guess I have been worn down to being a compliant worker bee.

**You are not smarter than the IRS.  If you watched Ozark and think you can move money around in the US without them seeing it or finding it...you are wrong.  Don't try doing that.**

**Don't lie.  If you are in this situation, suck it up and deal with them.  Get help if you need it.  DO. NOT.LIE.**

 They will come at you…not this year, but in 1 to 2 years or later.  They are that backed up.  They will ask for a whole range of detail.  If you do not provide it, with cross references or updates, they will nail you.  That is where it becomes scary.

 If anyone lives in the US and they find you have done any dealing in Crypto and you do not “check the box” on the Tax form they will come down hard on you.  Don’t do that.  They told me that is the first thing they will cross reference.

So, after two years I've finally submitted every note, spreadsheet, download, or report that I can find displaying my crypto history.  There are no more Merlin Cryto secrets.  They have it all.  Its up to their Wizards.

They will come back with a number that I can negotiate, dispute, or appeal.  I am pretty sure I won't have the money or inclination to fight this further.  I can pay their fine, get Jussie'd out of ""IRS jail"" and get on with my life.  When someone in your family has PC, you do not dwell on shit.  Even when its been gone for two years.

 The only thing that makes me smile is the knowledge that somewhere there are a bunch of college kids who made $50k in Dogecoin last year.  Or Shiba.  And they either blew it on Spring Break or they tried to hide it (They watch too much Ozark.). And these kids are going to have to claim that revenue on their Taxes, their parent’s taxes, and their FAFSA.  Financial Aid will get dropped.  And parents will be on the hook for their kids taxes…AND their own modest tax rate could get bumped up to another rate.  

That might be fun to watch as I emerge on the other end of the IRS colon

My best advice is be very careful.  Be honest.  And be prepared to show you work...just like a 7th grade algebra test.

If you have any questions, let me know.  I will do my best to answer them.  But...every case is different.","self","https://redd.it/thg7oi"

I’ve been in this field for many years now, and every dip I’d hear backtalk from friends and family and it doesn’t affect my anymore, it doesn’t matter what they think. Bitcoin is not dead. 

In one day, actually overnight where I’m at, BTC erased all yearly losses, and is on the path back to the bull market. There’s no more speculating now and the sights are set for the next chapter. 

Now instead of hearing ‘you shouldn’t have done this’ now I’m hearing ‘how can I buy in’ from my friends and family, I fear some people are just too offset the path to be saved, but I’ll still do my best to help regardless. 

I even had some family members ask me how to buy NFTs, or how to buy into the Metaverse and suku world, or how I feel about defi staking. Listen, I tried to offer you free advice back in the day and you refused, if you want to join the move you can still dca your way in. 

Most people will not buy the dip, and will feel that makes the token ‘undesirable’ this is why most people will fail to understand how crypto really works, and how economies work for that matter. There’s no room for idleness in such a fast market, so if you don’t act quick you’ll definitely miss it.","self","https://redd.it/tqu4vm"

Getting involved in worthwhile projects should be at the top of everyone's priority list. Your gains will outweigh your losses even if the market crashes. With solana, I did something similar and am now reaping the benefits.

Investing, paying tuition, donating to charities, and purchasing simple goods and services are all examples of cryptocurrency use, with more than half of all cryptocurrency transactions taking place in this way.
 The Proof of Work consensus algorithm has a negative impact on the environment.

 You'll need a lot of CPU power to secure the network. The Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm is used by Bitcoin, for example. Cryptocurrencies based on Proof of Stake are all environmentally friendly. Consensus is ensured by the holders of the crypto who have staked it. Stakers act as validators on the blockchain. They don't have a choice but to thoroughly validate the network or risk losing money.

People are switching to electric vehicles (EVs) at a faster rate than traditional cars, which is good news for the environment. I'm looking for projects that aren't just transactional, but also related to finance and management. Every industry is picking up speed as a result of the current trend, and new players have entered the market. I believe that a few undervalued projects will gain traction and profit handsomely.


I'm following a few under-appreciated projects. I began with Solana and Algo and am now seeing good results. The world's first tokenization of a for-profit social enterprise, bob eco coin, has piqued people's interest in cryptocurrency for a variety of reasons. Bob Eco and Jincheng - Suzuki are committed to the development of environmentally friendly motorcycles that will benefit our planet for many years to come. Any organisation or business can now be rebuilt using decentralised and blockchain principles. Now it's just a matter of seeing who succeeds.

Let's wait and see what the businesses do with it in the future!! I am very optimistic about this technology and would like to hear your thoughts on it.","self","https://redd.it/ttjr4p"

After tumbling to as low as $32,000 in late January and then retesting that level in late February, Bitcoin (BTC) has been on the rise for much of March, with its current streak of gains bringing the crypto just into positive territory for 2022.
The cryptocurrency was roughly flat for the last 24 hours, but is up 17% since it began its ascent last week. If it finishes the day with a gain, it would be up for eight straight days. Analysts are optimistic about bitcoin's prospects.

According to the technical breakdown by Arcane research: 

“The $47,500 area has been important technical resistance since early 2021.” Arcane Research also referenced a Goldman Sachs report that said more than half of surveyed institutions now have crypto exposure, up from 40% a year ago. “We should expect further institutional adoption in the future and increased financialization of bitcoin through financial instruments commonly used in traditional financial markets,"" Arcane Research said.

For someone who has been watching the market for a while, people know that Bitcoin, as everything, moves in cycles. Once it goes down, people will rush to buy it, because they have mass confidence that it will soon be back up again. 

With a little dip this morning, it seems investors are taking profit after a rally week up. As they should, but again as mentioned before, prices will be back up again. 

The real reason Bitcoin is pumping though, is because most people are starting to accept that Bitcoin is real, and will be there when fiat currency fails us. 

Even Russia has thrown around the proposal that they want their gas to be bought and sold with Bitcoin, crypto is real, and it’s available for everyone. 

Furthermore, this opens up the avenue for DeFi and DAOs. Now that the floodgates are open, people want more crypto, and more decentralized places to join. Even for current events like NFTs and staking, this is where people are heading. Places like Aloha DeFi or Fantom and AAVE are getting mass appeal for this reason. Now that people understood that there’s an alternative, there’s no going back.

You see, what most people don’t understand about DCA, is that sometimes it’s rewarding, but on the short-term, it’s almost always stressful and scary. 

That’s not something only I have notice, for it seems that most people are starting to understand that Bitcoin is a long play, and even short-term investors have become long-term ones. 

People want to hold Bitcoin, even those who wanted to flip it, have started holding. Take a look at this. 

Just look at the outflows/inflows chart and notice, that people are buying Bitcoin, pulling it out of exchanges, and hodling it. Maybe until the next halving. 

In the meantime, short-term users have moved on to other things, such as DeFi. Decentralized Finance has gained itself a positive reputation, especially among the younger generation, as the final replacement of the financial instruments we have today. And older platforms like Sushiswap being a decentralized exchange or even newer ones like Aloha DeFi which provide win win solutions for everyone involved in the spare mobile data utilization system, are trending, and for good reason. 

People want a better future than the present we have today, and they are finally beginning to understand that that could be achieved with cryptocurrency.

The weakness seen since the start of the year has begun to finally fade. 

BTC's strong move above the key level of $46,000 is helping to uplift market sentiment across the board — and as a result, DeFi coins have been making sharp moves! 

Aside from the uptrend seen in DeFi tokens, the rise in the TVL (Total Value Locked) across several protocols and the steadily increasing dApp revenue hint at a potential DeFi resurrection. Coming to raw figures, DeFi TVL now sits at an astounding sum of $228.05 billion!

The top DeFi tokens saw double-digit gains over the past 30 days. These stats are led by THORChain, which printed a growth of nearly 200%, and AAVE, which has risen about 54% since the beginning of March.

Such favorable conditions have also set the stage for rising DeFi stars such as Quint, Loopring, and Amp. All these projects have revolutionary fundamentals. Quint has innovative Super-staking Pools that aim to reward the token's stakers with unique real-world collectibles. Loopring settles transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to finalize trades between users that were first matched off-chain. And Amp is a token that can decentralize investors’ risk. These, and various other new projects linked to DeFi and GameFi space are expected to do extremely well.

All in all, the value locked in DeFi is on the uptrend, and multiple factors — most notably the positive global market conditions — point to the continuation of this uptrend, as opposed to its reversal. Everything is indicative of a potentially massive DeFi rally!","self","https://redd.it/ttxnrj"

To maintain the recent rally, the world's largest cryptocurrency now has to close consecutive daily candles over $46,400.

It has finally broken the cycle of lower highs between $45,800 and $45,300, paving the way for a push towards the $50,000 resistance level.

With $50,000 insight, if the asset can maintain trading volume this week, a quick rise to $53,000 might be on the cards.

As global markets began to rebound from the early-March lows triggered by Russia's conflict in Ukraine, the latest rise has coincided with a 10% gain in the S&P500.

While there are still plenty of warning flags from a macro perspective, Bitcoin and the overall crypto market appear to be headed for more gains.

A break below $45,000 would signal a fakeout, which would be disastrous given a large amount of leverage and open interest accumulated on the long side during this advance.

These signs indicate that I should begin trading my USDT and BEAN in BTC, as well as maybe certain altcoins that I believe have potential. It is entirely up to you to determine whether BTC will continue to rise or fall. In any case, I believe we are in a great spot right now. I'm looking for a new ATH before July, but it all relies on market behavior.","self","https://redd.it/tu22if"

According to Coinglass data, Bitcoin has closed April in the red on on three occasions and the worst monthly loss was a 3.46% drop in 2015. 

Although history favors the bulls, the Whale Shadows indicator has noticed that more than 11,000 Bitcoin has left a wallet in which it had been lying dormant for seven to ten years. The movement of similar-sized quantities from dormant accounts has generally resulted in a major top, according to independent market analyst Phillip Swift.

Bitcoin will be dominant in this one I feel, and I think it could be smooth sailing upwards soon after. This too will affect the markets of NFTs, and even DeFi, now being upgraded in an exponential scale unforeseen before. I started off small exchange like Werewolf and say it start up and become a major player, this too was the case for AAVE. DeFi will be pumping with it too I feel. 

Could bulls clear the overhead hurdle in Bitcoin and select altcoins and extend the strong recovery from the lows?

Along with keeping an eye on the crypto markets, traders should also track the performance of the U.S. stock markets for clues because Bitcoin has been closely correlated to the equity markets for the past several weeks.

Major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are currently experiencing a period of market volatility. Since late November and early December of 2021, the price of Bitcoin has been declining. BTC's market value is currently trapped below US$50,000, and investors are wondering when the coin would break through the obstacles and cross the mark. BTC's price soared quickly after the Biden administration issued an executive order encouraging crypto use in the United States. 

The Biden administration is presently analyzing the prospects presented by the rise of digital assets, according to the order. Investors who believe Bitcoin will rise in value in the future greeted the report with warm arms, but the order prompted some traders to sell their Bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin's initial price drop from over US$65,000 to under US$40,000 equates to the cryptocurrency losing roughly half of its worth. About March 2, the cryptocurrency reclaimed the $45,000 mark and continued to rise to around $47,000. The upward trend in pricing continued throughout the week, indicating a rise of more than 15% in a week's time.

Bitcoin's price has been extremely volatile in recent months, with the cryptocurrency shedding more than 40% of its value in just four to five months. Bitcoin is clearly on the rise, but it is also on the decline. Investors are stunned as crypto, which fueled the entire crypto market's development, plummets. Some crypto specialists, on the other hand, anticipate that Bitcoin will surpass $200,000 before the end of the year.

Seeing the movement of Bitcoin, perhaps it might be best to invest in some stable coin. There are several stable coins in the crypto market from fiat backed ones like USDT to crypto based ones like BNB. There are also several stable coin minting platforms. An example of this is Alkemy, a Solana based stablecoin minting platform which uses $darc to fuel its operation. 

Whether Bitcoin will see a bearish move we don't know but even if this occurs, it should have no bearing on your decision to invest in cryptocurrency. This is why experts have long advised that crypto investments be kept to less than 5% of whole investment portfolios. A bearish market trend would definitely have a negative impact on the global crypto market, but it is critical for investors to secure their financial bases before developing a long-term investment strategy. The recent price increase in Bitcoin is nothing new. Even experts predict that prices will fall at some point in the future; the key is to stay vigilant and invest properly.","self","https://redd.it/tx2his"

That implies the Virginia-based company spent $45,714 on average for each coin.

This follows the completion of a $205 million Bitcoin-collateralized loan last Tuesday. As a result, the $195 million Bitcoin purchase happened just seven days ago. They still have around a billion tokenized money on their public address, so after MicroStrategy, sales might continue.

MicroStrategy currently owns 129,218 Bitcoins (about $6 billion) in its possession. As a consequence, they've profited $2 billion, making this one of the riskiest investments ever. CEO Michael Saylor has declared on several occasions that the firm wants to retain Bitcoin for the long term and has no intentions to sell it.

From my own experience, these gentlemen have never lost money on their investments, and based on what I've read today, the market appears to be in fantastic shape. I was concerned that this BTC jump might be a trap, but I am now sure that it is not. Without a doubt, my USDT and BEAN (beanstalk) balances are both 0.

The higher the S2F ratio, the higher the asset's scarcity, and the greater the value it represents to buyers.

The last time the Stock-to-Flow ratio doubled was around 27 June 2021, when the figure went above 140. Following this, BTC soared more than 120%.

The latest doubling of the S2F ratio could trigger another bull run, which may take Bitcoin — and the entire crypto market alongside it — past their respective ATHs. Good projects with sound fundamentals such as Plastiks, a blockchain that closes the loop between real-world plastic production and recovery; Stellar, an open-source, decentralized project that connects large institutions for convenient transactions; and Solana, which supports smart contracts including NFTs and dApps, could see massive rallies.

Bitcoin is still selling at a discount compared to its ATH, and many know it well. The on-chain data suggests that, for the most part, BTC is leaving the exchanges to be transferred into personal wallets.

So finally, as BTC has flipped the 45k resistance into support, it's time to get serious again and set our sights higher!","self","https://redd.it/txtbnd"

I know that it’s common news to hear about what bank in the United States started accepting Bitcoin, or what European governments have ruled out concerning Bitcoin, but what many people don’t know, is that crypto is huge everywhere else. 

In places like Indonesia for example, crypto is massive. Crypto is the next big thing in Indonesia. According to the Ministry of Trade, transactions for currencies like Bitcoin grew over 14 times from a total of 60 trillion rupiahs ($4.1 billion) in 2020 to a total of 859 trillion rupiahs ($59.83 billion) in 2021.

It’s getting to the point where crypto is becoming more popular than traditional stock. Vice Minister of Trade Jerry Sambuaga stated that more than 11 million Indonesians bought or sold crypto in 2021. In comparison, according to the Indonesian Central Securities Depository, the total number of portfolio investors — indicated by the number of single investor identities — reached 7.35 million in 2021.

Even so, 11 million crypto investors is still only about 4% of Indonesia’s total population, meaning there’s still plenty of room to grow. The crypto community’s growth in Indonesia goes hand-in-hand with several supporting local phenomena, including but not limited to:
•  Regulatory support from government bodies

•  Increased ease of access to cryptocurrency trading

•  Adoption from major local tech players

What has been booming there too, is the advent of the Metaverse and the many coins and projects within it like Suku world and many others that have been making a good name for themselves out there. As people are starting to realize the value of these projects and their many applications, and the potential they could carry into the future. 

Although crypto assets are still not permitted as payment instruments, companies are welcome to buy and sell crypto as trading commodities in Indonesia. 

Since 2019, cryptocurrency trading in Indonesia has been officially overseen and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI), a body under the Ministry of Trade. 

This governing body is, among other things, in charge of vetting, documenting and approving companies and commodity items allowed to be traded in Indonesia. As of 2021, its whitelist of permitted crypto tokens reached 229 items, including popular assets such as Bitcoin, Ether Polkadot and Cardano","self","https://redd.it/txtu25"

On-chain data shows Bitcoin selling on the crypto exchange Binance has started to weaken in recent weeks as outflows have shot up.

## Binance Has Observed Negative Bitcoin Netflows Recently

As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, has seen a decline in BTC dumping recently.

The “netflow” is an indicator that tells us about the net amount of Bitcoin entering or exiting wallets of an exchange.

The value of this metric is calculated by simply taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows for the exchange in question.

When the netflow registers a positive value, it means inflows are currently dominating the outflows. Such a trend may be bearish for the price of Bitcoin as holders usually deposit their crypto to exchanges for selling purposes.

On the other hand, positive values of the indicator imply investors are taking out a net amount of coins at the moment. This kind of trend can be bullish for the crypto’s price as it may be a sign of accumulation.

Claims that will earn the raising of eyebrows, but fail to address the fundamental question is the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining is worth the benefits? This question should be broken down into two aspects: energy consumption and hardware churn.

The energy used by Bitcoin miners does three powerful things:

**Energy consumption**

1.Secures all the wealth stored on the Bitcoin network in a decentralized state.

Most current financial systems are controlled by a centralized entity, banks, credit unions, federal reserve, etc. This means that those central parties can manipulate funds, stop transactions or do whatever they feel is in the “best interest” of whatever source of power is pushing them to act. For example, Canada recently confiscated funds that were donated to a protesting group they did not agree with. Banks, credit unions, GoFundMe, and many other entities were asked to freeze accounts, stop payments or take action in some way to prevent funding the protesters. Because Bitcoin has no single point of control, flexing this level of power is not possible whether you’re an individual or a sovereign nation.

2.Creates a financial incentive that promotes renewable energy sources

Bitcoin mining has become a profitable industry for many companies. One major expense mining companies face is energy costs. What is the cheapest energy long-term? You guessed it, renewables. There is a built-in financial incentive to acquire the cheapest energy for these “for-profit” companies which means every mining company will seek out integrating renewable energies as part of their operational setup. With greater demand for renewables, renewable companies will allocate more funds for research and development to improve wind, solar, and hydro technologies to better fulfill the added market demand. Coming full circle, Bitcoin mining is not only promoting the adoption but also the improvement of renewable energy technology.

3.Provides stability to unstable power grids

An interesting aspect of Bitcoin mining is the ability for miners to be turned on or off ad hoc without affecting operational infrastructure, unlike cement, steel, or any other industrial entity. Because of this, we are seeing grid operators partnering with mining facilities to best make use of the energy grids. In Texas, there was a recent overload on the power grid when a freeze came through and every household had to turn off their heater. With the amount of energy needed to sustain every business and household, the energy grid was at a near collapse and rolling blackouts were pushed to keep the grid intact. Since the freeze, the grid has been expanding with added renewables and with miners leveraging much of the “excess” or unused energy. In the event of another freeze where the household energy consumption is expected to spike, the energy companies would pay the mining companies to turn off a portion of their Bitcoin miners to free up the needed energy supply to the grid. Once the household load subsides, the Bitcoin miners can be turned back on utilizing the freed-up “excess” energy.

**Hardware Churn**

The physical lifespan of a current ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miner is between 2-3 years. Financial lifespan will have a broader range depending on multiple factors such as cost of energy usage, when the miner comes online, the hash rate growth of the network, and what the Bitcoin price does during the miner’s lifespan. 

Another factor that’s had a significant impact on mining is the rate at which hardware technology has evolved, specifically for ASIC miners. As soon as a new miner is released, there is a stronger and more efficient miner right around the corner. This has led to a lot of churn with large-scale mining operations quickly retiring old miners and replacing them with new ones.

Given that Bitcoin mining is still relatively new, especially from a commercialization view, mining technology is evolving at a rapid rate which means if you are in the business of mining for profit, you’ll likely continue purchasing the new mining rigs to keep your financial returns competitive with your peers. This leaves many “older” mining rigs in a position of no man’s land where they can’t return profits worth their operational costs and they can’t be re-purposed for any other use.

I believe this is the most valid critique of Bitcoin mining but one that can hopefully be addressed in the near future. There have been a few ideas floating around, such as integrating retired miners with new home energy builds to help offset energy costs while maintaining the Bitcoin network or building miners in a way where once they are decommissioned, they can be better stripped to have their components re-purposed. Either way, hardware churn is a top concern of the Bitcoin community and is likely to be addressed as more hardware manufacturers enter the space.

**In Summary**

*Bitcoin mining is a waste of energy*

This critique is COMPLICATED - On one hand, the energy Bitcoin consumes is used to secure all of the stored wealth in a decentralized state, provides stability to power grids, and promote renewable energy development and implementation. On the other hand, the physical miners are often replaced frequently with no real repurposable utility for the retired miners.","self","https://redd.it/u3vyo1"

Late on Wednesday, BTC/USD reached an intraday high of $41,451.48, but this resistance level held fast, sending prices lower today. 

BTC plummeted to an intraday low of $39,714.69 earlier today, but it has since risen and is currently trading around $41,031.26, up roughly 3% from the previous low.

BTC has plummeted about $10,000 since reaching a high of $48,220 just two weeks ago, its highest level in over four months. 
However, following weeks of falls, it appears that we may have found a stable floor at $39,300, with bulls now aiming to push prices higher once more. 
Price strength, on the other hand, continues to develop in the direction of uncertainty, as it remains below its 43-point ceiling.

Everyone knows that Bitcoin is here to stay. It’s gone too big to go home now. It’s a household name and it’s being talked about everywhere. Not only that, but it has inspired changes in different places as well.

Recent reports of 30k Bitcoin leaving Binance and going into hold has me excited to hear what happens next. You see, holding and withdrawal patterns are often coupled with sudden trend reversals in the market. It can even have effect on every other market like defi as we’ve already seen with lycan and aave or even push other coins like cardano in the ether. Bitcoin has positive influence on the market and that’s beyond disagreement. 

However, as people start to hold, supply goes down. Too many Bitcoins have been going around from one person to the other, and this sudden utility has removed Bitcoin from it store-of-wealth title that has pushed it to 60k, and turned it back into an investment. Seems like this next wave of holding will be making a difference however.

The flow of Bitcoin from and into cryptocurrency exchanges is one of the elements that could signify the price of the flagship digital asset moving in either way, and Bitcoin has recently seen a significant outflow from them. 

According to a figure released by on-chain and social metrics platform Santiment on April 14, 25,878 or $1.04 billion BTC has departed crypto exchanges in 24 hours, the highest disparity between outflow and inflow in five weeks.

According to the platform’s tweet:
“Historically, large quantities of BTC moving off exchanges leads to price rises given a few days for the pattern to hold.”In other words, if the large outflow of Bitcoin continues over the next few days, a price increase might be imminent

Meanwhile, many others are bullish on Bitcoin's prospects, with some, such as the creator of cryptocurrency lender Nexo, predicting that its price will approach $100,000 in the next year. 

Should the stock market ""collapse,"" Antoni Trenchev believes that the Federal Reserve will ""return to easing in no time,"" giving cryptocurrencies even more momentum.

His opinion is close to that of Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky, who believes other cryptos like $Darc, ETH and so on will do well in the recession, he expects in the next year and has advised selling stocks and buying more Bitcoin. As he explained:
“From the beginning of the year the stock market is down but Bitcoin has actually recovered most of its losses.

Although the anonymous Twitter alias has been known to miss Bitcoin price predictions in the past, he remains enthusiastic on the commodity, predicting that it would reach $100K by the end of the year.

The bitcoin analyst with over 1.7 million followers on Twitter said in a tweet (https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1514915450525827073) that he doesn’t see a reason that would bring bitcoin’s price down to its current realized price (average cost price) at $24.5K. He also noted that there were only three times that such a capitulation occurred in history.

 • Bitcoin SV (BSV) forking in 2018, Bitstamp, and Mt. Gox being respectively hacked in 2014 and 2011 were incidents – in PlanB’s view – that pushed BTC down below its realized price level

Willy Woo, another well-known Bitcoin expert, disagrees that BSV forking was to blame for Bitcoin's steep price slide below important support levels in 2018; instead, he feels the ""effect of whale control of BitMEX perps at full scale"" was to blame. 
BitMEX was one of the most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges in the world when it was founded in 2014. It became the most popular derivatives product at one point with the launch of ""perpetual futures"" in 2016, which were designed to entice traders interested in leverage trading. 

Despite the fact that PlanB's previous prognosis of Bitcoin hitting over $100K in 2021 failed to materialize, according to his ""floor model,"" the analyst predicted in February that BTC would achieve a six-digit price before the end of the year.

Despite the fact that PlanB's previous prognosis of Bitcoin hitting over $100K in 2021 failed to materialize, the analyst predicted in February that BTC will reach a six-digit price tag by the end of 2023 using both the S2F and the logarithmic regression.

Bitcoin affects all crypto directly or indirectly being the fact of the crypto world. Crypto is also used for various reasons including promoting developers Ad Tea does or by promoting gaming and art like those in open sea.","self","https://redd.it/u5gx7l"

Wondering whether that's a good or a bad thing...","None",0.72,30,0,0,17,0,"We constantly see news of multibillion-dollar corporations purchasing cryptocurrencies in massive amounts, mostly BTC but many others as well.

Just this month, Luna Foundation Guard bought thousands of BTC, and they have a total of over 40,000 bitcoins.

Microstrategy holds about 125,000 BTC, valued at over $5.8 billion.

Certainly, institutional interest in crypto is just a part of mass adoption. It is unavoidable that large corporations and institutions will fiddle where the money is; there's no way around it. However, this has me wondering, what about the average Joe?

The retail investors that have an actual interest in cryptocurrencies, those that believe in the technology and want to utilize it for its intended purpose; i.e. BTC as a decentralized store of value and payment currency, don't have millions to purchase BTC like institutions.

As institutions hold billions in BTC, it keeps the buying pressure up, but what if they sell and it causes a large dip in BTC? Institutions can manipulate the market however they want, causing retail to panic sell and then buy back BTC at a lower price. And as BTC falls, other projects that have good fundamentals like Plastiks or Link, they will fall too. And these institutions also include CEXs like Coinbase, Binance, FTX, etc that can see your orders.

Theoretically, a billionaire corporation can buy billions worth of BTC, driving the price up and leaving less supply for the entire world.

In short, institutional interest in crypto is a part of mass adoption, but it will almost certainly negatively impact the average investor that's in cryptos for the technology.","self","https://redd.it/u5gy8k"

As markets remained quiet due to the Easter holiday, Bitcoin was trading barely above the $40,000 barrier on Saturday. 

To begin the weekend, BTC/USD surged to an intraday high of $40,618.84, up from a low of $40,009.09 earlier in the session. 

The recent price stability follows a two-week losing trend in which bitcoin lost about $10,000 in value.

Markets typically consolidate after a bullish or bearish trend in a short period of time, as they prepare for either a continuation of the initial move or a change of direction. 

Looking at the chart, the 14-day RSI is still below a significant resistance level of 44, which appears to be the main roadblock to BTC bulls regaining control. 

If current sentiment holds, we could see some more drops back to $39,600 before any future extended advances.

Bitcoin is used for many projects including the Point Network which is one that enforces cyber security and also as a legal tender for some states. It will thus be no surprise to see it surpass its peak in the near future","self","https://redd.it/u5hi8q"

That is why many people believe expert predictions since they are continually trying to anticipate a bull market. You can check what Bitcoin is doing by looking at trading apps and websites 

This article will examine what experts believe will happen to Bitcoin in 2022.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high in November, with one coin worth $68,000. That's why so many people predicted it would hit $100,000 before the end of the year. However, after November, the price of Bitcoin plummeted, making it more difficult to forecast where it will trade next. 

Bitcoin, according to many critics, will plummet to as low as $10,000. This would come as a huge shock to many investors, but it would also allow more people to buy a single coin. However, more individuals are beginning to believe that Bitcoin will eventually hit $100,000, but this is not going to happen anytime soon.

Large corporations, like as Nike, are currently attempting to monetise their products in the metaverse. There will be increased demand for cryptocurrencies as more businesses, games, and products follow suit. As a result, many individuals are beginning to believe that Bitcoin's value will continue to rise. 

However, because of the market, many people are hesitant to write down a date or a phone number. Instead, many people believe that the value of Bitcoin will rise over time. They also advise investors to anticipate a long-term increase in the value of Bitcoin as a result of natural market activity.","self","https://redd.it/u5jm8c"

Bitcoin’s been catching a lot of heat lately over its energy consumption. Article after article comes out that decry its harm to the environment. 

But the truth is far more comforting than a handful of seemingly harsh data points about Bitcoin and the environment. I wanted to create this post to equip every miner and Bitcoiner with the arguments they need to spread the truth about Bitcoin’s impact on the environment.

How could such an energy-consuming technology benefit the Green Movement?

In short, there’s more to Bitcoin than its critics appreciate.

**Bitcoin mining renders renewable energy sources viable.** 

In April 2021, Jack Dorsey’s Square released a white paper boldly titled, “Bitcoin is Key to an Abundant, Clean Energy Future”. Early in the memo, the authors explained that the costs for solar and wind energy have recently dropped by 90% and 71%, respectively. Suffice to say that green alternatives are rapidly gaining steam on the cost side of the ledger.

But as explained above, it’s difficult to match supply of solar and wind energy to demand. Demand for energy peaks in the early evening, when people are home and using appliances. At that time, though, the sun is already setting, and wind is always unpredictable.

**Enter Bitcoin mining**

Miners can work from anywhere, so long as they’re connected to a power source and the internet. Because of this, they can act as ‘an energy buyer of last resort’: whenever supply of wind or solar exceeds demand, miners can jump in and pay for the privilege of using the energy to mine Bitcoin. This will render renewable energy far more profitable, and will therefore incentivize the creation of *more* green energy sources.

Square’s white paper puts it succinctly: “Bitcoin miners…offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load…and are completely location agnostic, requiring only an internet connection. \[They are\] an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment’s notice anywhere in the world.”

**Bitcoin is one of the cleanest industries on the planet**

In 2021, the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) published the results of a voluntary survey that investigated the electricity consumption and sustainable power mix of about one-third of the Bitcoin network. They discovered that those surveyed used electricity fed by 67% sustainable power. The surveyors inferred that the entire Bitcoin network’s sustainable electricity mix had increased to 56%, making it among the greenest industries in the world.

In contrast, electricity in the United States is only 30.5% sustainable, and electricity in China is less than 15% sustainable. 

**Bitcoin mining employs energy that would’ve otherwise gone to waste**

As Caitlin Long, CEO of Avanti Financial Group, said in a recent documentary, “More than 2/3 of the energy produced in the world is waste energy, because it’s produced during the hours of the day when there’s not demand to consume it…it’s also produced in a place where there’s not transmission to move it across space and time, and so that energy goes unused and wasted.” 

Crusoe Energy and others are tackling this issue with bitcoin Mining. The company raised 128 million dollars in 2021 to build data centers and Bitcoin mining operations that use this wasted energy and reduce methane emissions.

Crusoe Energy operates out of North Dakota, where 500 million cubic feet of gas are flared daily. The company runs forty data centers that harness flared natural gas as of 2021. Soon, they expect to operate 100 units across six states.  

Co-founder of Crusoe Energy, Lochmiller, said that “Where we view our power consumption, we draw a very clear line in our project evaluation stage where we’re reducing emissions for…oil and gas projects.”

**Energy consumption drives progress and so doesn’t require defending**

Professor Vaclav Smil’s *Energy and Civilization: A History* traces the relationship between energy consumption and human progress. To take one example, he explains that a typical 1900 Great Plains farmer employed at most 5 kilowatts of power to plow his field using horses. In 2000, a farmer couple can employ over 250 kilowatts of power with a diesel engine, all while “sitting high above the ground in the air-conditioned comfort of his tractor cabin.”

Smil’s thesis aligns with our common sense. There is a reason that modern cities consume more energy than ancient villages, that airplanes consume more energy than horses, and that calculators consume more energy than abacuses. Seen in this light, even *if* Bitcoin was the most energy-intensive money ever invented, that does not mean that we should continue using gold and fiat currencies. A more comprehensive comparison should compare all of the costs *and* benefits conferred on humanity by each money. 

To critics of Bitcoin who appeal to its energy consumption, I ask: why is environmental impact the standard by which you judge an innovation, rather than the benefit said innovation would confer on humanity?

Their AMAs are super interesting to listen to, and they love to get questions from fellow miners and Bitcoiners.","self","https://redd.it/u8o0dg"

There are more liquidations available to the upside rather than the downside.  


Retail is buying puts hand over fist, and there is little reason to believe they will be allowed to expire in the money.  


Dovish FOMC meeting was recent  


The Max Pain sits at 40k, 4k above price. Price tends to move towards max pain rather than away from it, so it will tend to move upwards.  


Twitter sentiment is still EXTREMELY bearish (even more so than earlier), which rather than ignition sends a signal of the bearish trend's exhaustion.  


All of the long liquidations have taken place already, and this tend to lead to a reversal.  


Insider stock traders have MASSIVELY slowed their selling down, and are in fact buying the dip!  


If we close this weekly candle red, it will be tied for the longest streak of red weekly candle closes of all time for bitcoin .  


The elliot wave count's impulse down is looking complete and ready to reverse.  


Bearish Points:  


None that I am aware of. Please inform me of any shorter term bearish factors you are watching if you would like to see these.  


That comes out to 9 points for the bulls and 0 points for the bears. The very very resounding conclusion here is that prices will be quite likely to rise.","self","https://redd.it/ujrr5x"

I've worked with other coins such as BNB and XRP in the past via small trades done using in-game currencies.

Lately, I've been seeing quite some demand in Bitcoin and some of my mates told me that it was worth trying in the market. So there I went, got a bitFlyer account (JP, Legit) and joined Lightning, which is basically their re-brand of the live market.

&#x200B;

The dashboard looks like this: [Screenshot \[lightning.bitflyer.com\]](https://prnt.sc/Z6SghUGvuYAB)

The special section looks like this: [Screenshot \[localhost\]](https://prnt.sc/Zoo1ANVD7KkX)

But I've been having some issues with using ""SPECIAL"" purchases section, which cover the following:

* **IFD** If two orders are made at the same time and the first one is filled, then the second order is automatically placed.
* **OCO** When two orders are made at the same time and one is completed, the other side is automatically canceled.
* **IFDOCO** IFDOCO is a combination of the IFD and OCO patterns. After an IFD order is filled, the OCO order is automatically placed.

With those, there are these certain options, which I just simply didn't understand, and are most likely an issue:

* **LIMIT**
* **MARKET**
* **STOP**
* **STOP-LIMIT**
* **TRAILING**

I tried researching about those, but I can't find anything about them, please help.

The dashboard included [this website](https://lightning.bitflyer.com/docs/specialorder) with some definitions but I didn't fully understand it

My brain got some context at stop-limit and market, I'm assuming stop-limit softlocks after the coin reaches a critical amount and market is the current market price, but what on earth would be trailing?

The volume we've seen drive down the BTC price is largely institutional traders treating BTC as a speculative asset to make a quick buck in a low interest environment. They quickly dumped their coins in an escape to fiat. The consequence of this dump scared new retailers into selling their coins.

However, I imagine the institutions are surprised BTC's price hasn't fallen further. The legion of long term holders that never sell and continue to accumulate is at an all time high. This army of plebs is supporting the price and is unlikely to capitulate under any circumstance (almost).

What we're all waiting for is the next leg down after a big dump by whales. This could be the final catalyst before finding the floor. I'm not well versed to the impact from leveraged long and short traders but I've read longs are piling in at record levels. The cascading effect of these liquidations may also be a force to drive price down.

Give it a few months and I believe we'll reach the absolute bottom. My prediction is we'll see $19-22k. This will be the load zone for whales and wall street to re-enter. It may also be the point that some diamond hands show they are not quite strong as presumed. I hope not but the fear it's going to $6k will shake some. Don't fall into this category! Don't be the sell side of the whale buying!

Simultaneous to this price movement, we have layer 2 applications being rapidly developed by top tier teams and individuals. Additionally, we have regulations and revised accounting standards close to being deployed. The stage will be perfectly set for new explosive growth and price movement. By the end of 2022, the price will have recovered to $45k.

With the stage set and the macro economy stabilizing, a new tidal wave of money will enter the space. This wave will crash everyone's expectations and usher in the next era of BTC. We will quickly see the price rise above $100k by the end of 2023. This momentum's effect on price will strengthen with the aide of the next halving. We will never see another 70% drawdown on BTC's price. We'll reach the $100k+ level and start to stabilize - waiting for the next era that will be even more exciting. I think we'll eventually see $180k in this period.

Anyone that buys now at $30k, will 3-6X their investment by 2024. Anyone that buys at $18-22k will 6-9X their investment. Anyone that ultimately capitulates at $19k, will buy back at $45k.

Good luck ya'll and keep at it!","self","https://redd.it/uubb1h"

I think some of you may find this useful. 

[https://imgur.com/a/mRA82Nt](https://imgur.com/a/mRA82Nt)

This is an example of an auto-generated trendline from the algorithm.

I was doing an investigation into support trendlines. Particular  automated generation of trend lines and gathering statistics on retests,  angles and expected RoI. This example was selected due to the simplicity of 2D geometry: y = mx +  c. More complex formations may require feature points detection + a  classification algorithm  such as Support-Vector machines, Recursive Neural Networks or K-means  clustering. 

Fitting trendlines automatically will allow us to gather statistics on price action and trendline retests. 

The assumptions for trend line creation...  

* (1) Trendline is formed by two daily lows. 
* (2) The trendline must not have any intercepting lows between the two candidates for selecting a trendline 
* (3) An intercept is considered intercepting the trend line  when the trendline residual is < the interpolated position on the  trendline +1%

The assumptions for retest are...

* (1) The residual is within +/- 1% of the interpolated position on the trendline. 

The assumptions for breakdown of a support line is...

* (1) The residual is < 1% of the interpolated position on the trendline. 

I gathered various data on price action such as the number of retests  before breakdown, the angle of the trend line, the length of time from  retest to local high,  the median/mean delta from trendline to market high, the length of time a  trendline is active, the size of trendline clusters, the volume traded  at the trendline, etc.  In a detailed investigation, I may use eigenvalue decomposition to  identify the metrics with the highest statistical distribution. Usually  these will contain the  most information about the model constructed. However, in this study, I  just look at the number of retest and angle as an example of how to find  statistical edges.  

The mean sample size for trendlines per ticker is \~300. This gives us a margin-of-error of +/- 5% with 95% confidence.   

We will define statistical edges as an expectancy above 0. We will calculate expectancy as  

**strike rate \* expected return - (1 - strike rate) \* stop**

[**https://imgur.com/a/4q4jMNu**](https://imgur.com/a/4q4jMNu)

Example of probability of breakdown per retest for a single ticker.

The first interesting stats are the probability of breaking down a  support line does not change with the number of retests. It is always a  favourable 75%. Likewise  the median RoI is also a consistent 9-12% for all retests. Note:  Outliers were removed from the sampleset before computing these  statistics (2.968σ). 

**(0.25)\*9 - (0.75)\*2 = 2.25 - 1.5 = 0.75 before commission and slippage.**

No edge. The breakdown statistic was also consistent with trendline  angle. Since our strike rate is fixed, we may be able to increase our  edge by maximising our  expected returns.  

[https://imgur.com/a/hLp5tca](https://imgur.com/a/hLp5tca)

Modelled trend line residual as % change relative to trend line price at time t, for varying support line angles.

Unfortuantely our sample size for angle bins is considerably lower,  so we will have to increase our samplesize to get more meaningful  results, but this is adequete  enough for an explanation.  

This is quite  interesting as previously discrestionary traders  claimed trendline breakdowns are more violent when the angle is lower.  Though we dont gather stats  on the velocity of breakdowns, we can see that our retest long positions  will have an increased return on investments for negative gradient  trendlines, i.e.,  retests in a bear market or retesting market corrections in a bull  market.  

A factor of 3 increase would put our new edge at... 

**(0.25)\*27 - (0.75)\*2 = 6.75 - 1.5 = 5.25 before commission and slippage.** 

Considerably higher! It's amazing how statistical analysis can skew  the probability gods in our favour. Alternatively we may be able to  achieve a higher strike rate by focusing on trading the breakdown rather  than the retest.  

So ignoring trading a breakdown, we can setup a potential strategy for backtesting... 

* (1) Enter @ 1% above support line of negative gradient 
* (2) Tight stop @ 1% below support line  
* (3) Exit @ median or after 2 days (median time to top).

We can go a step further by creating a cumulative distribution for  the sample set to calculate the proability of RoI... but leave the fight  for another day.  

Don't forget to split your test and training datasets during backtests and use a Monte Carlo to simulate all market conditions! 

Hopefully this can provide some guidance on how to use investigations  to identify statistical edges in the market for exploitation.","self","https://redd.it/uxelff"

Saylor has spent about $3.9 billion buying bitcoin and at Bitcoin' current price of about $29,000, Saylor is estimated to have lost about $240 million… but he isn't one bit bothered.

Although strange, Saylor believes that one BTC will one day be worth millions of dollars and so even with BTC plunge from around $68k to current $29k, Saylor says trading isn't an option he's considering anytime soon.

Combined with bitcoin' price plunge, bitcoin network Proof-of-work validation mechanism has faced massive criticism due Its environmental impact when compared to Proof-of-stake networks like Zetrix and Solana which are more environmentally friendly.

So Saylor mentions the likes of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page, who earned their billions by building a real product and not by trading.

Yeah, Saylor could be right about hodling being more profitable when compared to day trading, but how easy is it to Hodl bitcoin knowing you are already in loss??","self","https://redd.it/uzut3u"

Lately, I see people attacking Bitcoin because “since Bitcoin\`s price is clearly correlated with the centralized economy (FED rates, wars, fiscal policy, economic cycles, and so on) then Bitcoin is not a decentralized alternative to the current economic system, it all the same thing”. In other words, Bitcoin failed its purpose, and it's no different than traditional assets like stocks or bonds.

I understand the logic behind all of this, Bitcoin was in theory created as a response to the 2008 economic crisis so its price being correlated with the centralized economic system may be interpreted as a failure or even irony. In my opinion, that's bullshit for many reasons, but the simpler explanation is we (Bitcoin enthusiasts) just don't live in a vacuum.

The centralized economy will dictate how much money we can afford to hold, for example, if your company is firing people or reducing your hours you probably need to sell some of your holdings, and/or you won't be able to keep accumulating at the same rate you did in the past. The centralized economy will also dictate miners' profits and investment, because of utility costs, taxes, financial expenses, and so on. That's common sense 101!

I know Bitcoin looks like a giant but compared with other assets it's pretty small, for example, Bitcoin´s fully diluted market cap is way lower than Tesla´s market cap. It's incredibly stupid to believe the “real” economy would somehow not affect Bitcoin in the medium and short term, we are a small thing and we have no power to fight the friking economic system.

Of course, the long-term objective is to create a decentralized economy, and the Bitcoin price will at some point be independent of any kind of centralized forces. But this will take decades and that's in fact a great opportunity because we all know Bitcoin was designed to reward adopters (the earliest the better).

The fact Bitcoin is NOT an “uncorrelated asset” right now shouldn't be seen as a failure to serve its original purpose but as a huge incentive to keep holding and accumulating hoping we will --at some point-- be able to achieve this and make a nice profit in the process. Just reaching gold´s market cap (a reasonable medium-term objective IMAO) would mean a 20x from now, the power of holding is crazy.

Is there any reason why I shouldn't trade it for a stack of GBTC instead? My thesis is:

1. GBTC will eventually be converted to an ETF, eliminating the current \~30% discount to NAV and netting a large gain vs holding plain BTC.
2. I have stable income and other assets, so I'm unlikely to be forced to sell this position early before the above happens.
3. The risk that Grayscale exit scams or otherwise looses their coins is extremely small.

The only risk I can see is that somehow they fail to convert to an ETF forever and I'm stuck eating the 2% annual fee. However, at the current \~30% discount, this has to go on for like 15 years before I start taking a loss.

From the second bull run, the ratio between the Nov2013 high and the Nov2011 low is 1177.19 / 2.01 = 585.67.

From the third bull run, the ratio between the Dec2017 high and the Jan2015 low is 19764.51 / 163.88 = 120.6.

From the fourth bull run, the ratio between the Nov2021 high and the Dec2018 low is 68944.62 / 3148.33 = 21.9.

&#x200B;

The second derivatives, then:

The ratio of the returns of the second bull run to the third bull run: 585.67 / 120.6 = 4.86.

The ratio of the returns of the third bull run to the fourth bull run: 120.6 / 21.9 = 5.51.

&#x200B;

And the third derivative is 5.51 / 4.86 = 1.13.

&#x200B;

Extrapolated, the implied ratio of the returns of the fourth bull run to the fifth bull run is 5.51 \* 1.13 = 6.25.

The returns on the fifth bull run would then be 21.9 / 6.25 = 3.5.  Yes, seriously.

And if the low for this bear market is in at 17607.69,

Then the high for the fifth bull run will be 17607.69 \* 3.5 = 61626.92.  The first bull market peak lower than the last.

&#x200B;

It may be appropriate there's three 6s in that number, lol (though all of the calculations above are rounded, so don't take it too much to heart).

This implies, to me, the end of a super cycle, that the following low will then be much lower than 17607.69, and may be followed by an even lower high, but the ending low, whenever that is, must be below the Dec2018 low in order to complete the super cycle and allow a new super cycle to begin.

Stop me if you've heard this.

And please fight me on it, I am nearly all-in on crypto, and I am desperate for a refutation.","self","https://redd.it/vhw3va"

So I am trying to build a repository of free/useful tools for the crypto community on my website. 

My idea for this week is to build a realtime view of arbitrage opportunities across exchanges. Of course the vision sounds cool to me but what matters most is your feedback if you will use it or not.

Goal: Give a somewhat realtime look into arbitrage opportunities in crypto on one page. It isn't meant to be a signal or anything super fancy (does that make this completely useless?)

Current state: [https://asset.gift/tools/arbitrage-map](https://asset.gift/tools/arbitrage-map)

Question? What simple features should I focus on for the next few days. My current thoughts:

i) Include more assets / trading pairs

ii) Include a way to select two exchanges at a time. Right now I have CB and Binance but if you could use a dropdown and select Binance and Bitstamp for example.

iii) Style the table with colors to know when something is going up and down.

iv) Incorporate exchange rate data (I have access to it but not sure how to make it digestible).

I want to get this to a decent state and just leave it out there soon -- am I on the right track? Is this a dashboard you would use (again completely free).

I posted about this in the daily and feedback so far:

\- Incorporate Web Socket data

\- Not sophisticated enough for a full time trader, 

\- Incorporate the round trip profit ie account for fees on both ends

Feel free to be as harsh as possible!","self","https://redd.it/vnf5m2"

I’ve been surfing the Internet for interesting crypto articles and found one that seems to be pretty provocative considering the religion and crypto mixed together in it. In this post I will briefly talk about the points.

Nowadays cryptocurrency and blockchain are the most popular matter of discussion in the world. If you are a regular to different crypto forums and media resources, you could eventually notice that Bitcoin has gathered a whole crowd of enthusiasts, or to be more precise, adepts, thinking it can be a real religion.

* **Lorcan Roche Kelly** from Bloomberg, a financial news provider, has said that BTC is “the first true religion of the 21st century.”. Also, **Hass McCook** called himself a Bitcoin Evangelist and “The Friar”. He has also written a few Medium posts comparing crypto to religion.
* The **Church of Bitcoin** was created in 2017. Its followers consider Satoshi Nakamoto to be their prophet.
* In Texas, there is an advertising campaign with huge billboards saying **“In crypto we trust”, “Crypto is real”** etc.

**What does BTC have in common with religion?**

I can’t really define what religion is because it’s something that has no official scientific meaning explained in the dictionary. All in all, religion is a summary of cultural ideas and doctrines which are related to life, death, and God interpretations. Usually, these depend on the origin countries.

Considering this, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency do not contain any of these topics which leads us to a logical conclusion — neither Bitcoin nor any other crypto are not connected to religion by no means.

**So why would people claim that BTC is a whole separate religion?**

Some, like Hass McCook, are using the religion terminology to emphasize some Bitcoin cultural aspects and make middlemen get used to them.

For instance, “stacking sats” (that’s when users purchase small pieces of Bitcoins) sounds strange. But McCook talks about the religious ritual while giving this process another name — “tithing”, used to call the little donations from members in order to support their church.

So, in this situation, the word actually makes the action sound good and principled.

Additionally, some Bitcoiners think that BTC is not only the way to make money but also the ultimate answer to all people’s problems. “Because the root cause of all of our problems is basically money printing and capital misallocation as a result of that,” McCook argues, “the only way the whales are going to be saved, or the trees are going to be saved, or the kids are going to be saved, is if we just stop the degeneracy.” Such an attitude might be the reason for comparing BTC with religion.

**In view of the foregoing, do you think cryptocurrency is related to a religious theme, and could Bitcoin become a new religion that solves all of humanity’s problems? If yes, why? Or why not?**","self","https://redd.it/vtc09a"

I'm doing everything the classic trader does: observe multiple timeframes, calculate r/r, place SL and TP, etc. but I have absolutely zeroooo idea what to do when it comes to using indicators.

In the beginning I was using only RSI and SMAs to spot support/resistance levels and find good entries. They're simple enough, right? But now I stumbled upon other indicators like EMAs and boilinger bands. On CT I've even seen some use some weird ass ichimoku cloud indicators. 

My question is: which indicators should I use and how many?

I'm asking this because indicators have been a mixed bag for me. They both helped but also made me make quite a few bad trades. I don't want to waste time anymore using vaporwave indicators!!!","self","https://redd.it/vtj9kw"

[https://imgur.com/a/4Rs85Jv](https://imgur.com/a/4Rs85Jv)

The BTCGBP (I follow) pair hasn't been great recently, and the BTCUSD is also a bit vague. Looking at the BTCJPY pair it's clear price action has being really influenced by JPY. BTC looks range bound by the 100week/200week BTCJPY pair, with the 200week BTCUSD possibly about to act as resistance. Would love to hear some views.

Given that BTC is such an obvious arbitrage point for forex finding these relationships seems pretty important. If anyone has any recommendations on new sources, strategies etc, I'd be really interested to hear. I'm not familiar with multipair arb techniques.

PS. I tried posting this to r/bitcoin and r/cryptocurrency as a request for news sources/etc but the bots removed the posts. So frustrating. BTC being global is a massive benefit to all people to share knowledge about their lives, the BTCUSD whitewash on those subs is extremely tedious.","self","https://redd.it/w15o14"

With an outer support wave from when trading seriously began in Oct 2010 until a presumed peak in Nov 2021. Then inner waves deviating from support that are the classic bubble cycles. Including two usually unidentified crunched bubbles during Oct and Nov 2010 that can be seen on a log-log scale. There’s no data for this model to fit the slope on the other side of the outer wave until support is reestablished in hindsight.

Layers of scales are used. With a linear fit of the outer wave and a sine wave fit of the inner waves. Using ln(price)+3 and ln(years)+6 scales to work with non-negative values, and inverse-sine (asin) scales for waves.

Dear fellow bitcoiners.
I like trading. Sure, im no pro, but its just fun to do.

I only have 100% btc in my portfolio, no alts in this state of the market.

I currently trade in the 30 minute timeframe chart. In 3 weeks time, i made about 600 usdt profit. However,  btc rose from  19k to 23k .. so basiclyi would have gained more from just hodling. Therefor, i think trading on a higher timeframe would probably be better.

My question: what indicators do you use (im on tradingview)? I usually have just some sma/ema and the macd and stoch rsi.

Or should i just resort to hodl btc and sell bits by bits during a rally and buy back after the dip?

Thank you for your time!","self","https://redd.it/w4dwpv"

Bitcoin, one of the most popular digital assets, rose by 8.69% to 22,786 in afternoon action while ethereum increased by 15.64% to 1,595.01. The second largest increase in valuation was 10.2% to 58.15 in litecoin. 

The Federal Reserve delivered its second major rate hike in succession on Wednesday, raising its target rate by 0.75% and stating that expects ""ongoing increases"" in the months ahead despite slower growth in the economy.

The Fed's hike to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% matched the largest move since 1994.

So here's a little something to help out the newbie traders that are struggling to understand it all.

Markets work in structure and ranges. Trading is recognising and identifying the current structure of a market within the current range.

The more you trade, the quicker you'll get at identifying the current structure. 

When I first started trading, price to me just looked completely random. It isn't, just keep looking and training your brain.

How many lines should you have on a chart? Just 2, one for the range top and one for the range bottom. Having these 2 lines will help your brain hone in on the current range. Scalp within the range. 

When you feel it's time for price to leave the range, start using a trailing stop; to catch the trend to the next range or stop out at break even. Once you reach the next range, punch out the moment price starts reversing. Statistically, you'll make more money, even if you miss a big move.

This isn’t the fear event that will take us lower. This is market manipulation at its finest. Wyckoff is still on the table. A close above $18,800 will confirm that yesterday’s close is part of the “spring” we are looking for. This will also engulf the yesterday’s candle body which would be bullish. Everything looks very calculated to me so I’m still leaning towards whale manipulation over retail fear right now.

I’ve been in Bitcoin since 2017 and have not always been able to hold strong because it always feels like “this time is different” and that this time “it really is over.” As you can tell I deal with pretty bad generalized anxiety. My fear and stress can be overwhelming sometimes but I also try desperately to make decisions not based on blind belief in a project. 

I know in 2018 after the crash it really felt like Bitcoin was over, but obviously it wasn’t, but for some reason this time it feels like after the crash of Terra and of UST, the collapse of so so many online “crypto banking” sites like Celsius and voyager and more, and the current massive generalized negative public view of Bitcoin and crypto as useless and just as scams run by shitty influencers and celebrities that maybe this time it really is over and it isn’t going to hit it’s all time high again. I don’t know if that’s my anxiety speaking or just maybe what I believe currently based on those facts I just stated about how much the crypto market has shifted and how many bad things have happened in the last year since the all time high. 

I held my bitcoin strong obviously during the recent all time high almost a year ago, and have since lost just over 6 figures in value by deciding to not sell back then. I really just want to know people’s opinions on what they themselves believe. 

I know no one can predict the future, but I’m not asking for predictions more just everyone’s individual beliefs about whether bitcoin will ever recover it’s all time high and if they do believe it will, how long they believe it might take.","self","https://redd.it/xoihhc"

https://www.podcasttheway.com/l/libra/

Description copy and pasted:

Facebook tried to disrupt the world - and the world says ""no."" Facebook launched Libra in June 2019. Libra would be an international currency and payment system. It would flow instantly around the world by phone. It could even ""bank the unbanked."" But Libra would also make Facebook too big to control- and lead the way for Facebook's Silicon Valley fellows to swing the power of their money as they pleased. Facebook and their friends could work around any single country's rules. Libra could shake whole economies and Facebook would become the ""digital identity"" provider to the world. Governments looked at Libra - and saw another 2008 financial crisis in the making. Facebook's plan would have made the company even more entrenched - at the cost of broken economies worldwide; starting with toppling the US dollar.

""Libra Shrugged"" is the story of a bad idea.

Bio: David Gerard writes the cryptocurrency and blockchain news site Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain. He is the author of the 2017 book Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain: Bitcoin, Blockchain, Ethereum & Smart Contracts and the 2020 book Libra Shrugged: How Facebook Tried to Take Over the Money. Until he reinstalled the laptop they were on, he was the proud owner of six Dogecoins. He remains a frequent, if occasionally annoyed, user of Facebook.

As well as being a crypto journalist, David also works as a Unix system administrator, where his job includes keeping track of exciting new technologies, and advising against the bad ones. He has also been an award-winning music journalist, and has blogged about music at Rocknerd.co.uk since 2001. He is a volunteer spokesman for Wikipedia, and for skeptical wiki RationalWiki.org. Originally from Australia, he lives in east London with his spouse Arkady Rose and their daughter.","self","https://redd.it/xojziz"

Over the last few years, I've been leveraging my knowledge in programming to produce a set of tools that would improve my trading success. One of them is a ""Trades Visualizer"".

Fullscreen recommended, Desktop: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yunwuIKlgQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yunwuIKlgQ)

It uses trade data from exchanges (ex: Binance) and renders all of it accessible to you for viewing, filtering, or aggregating for stats purposes. Think of TradingView, but without the membership fee and with the ability to view every trade ever placed on that exchange.

Ideally, I'd like to make it open source while also maintaining it for the foreseeable future. There's still more work / polish I'd like to do before that can happen.

I'm hoping the community will find such a tool useful - if alternatives already exist and this serves no purpose, I'll shelve it and move on to something else. Otherwise, I welcome all feedback / suggestions.

A quick overview of what's currently possible:

\- View all trades ever placed on an exchange. BTC / USDT is used for demonstration purposes in the video due to the challenge posed by its high daily trading activity, but other pairs could easily be used as well (ex: ADA / USDT, ETH / USDT, etc.).

\- The trade data currently used originates from Binance, but any data from any exchange could technically be used, as long as they offer an API to fetch it. In Binance's case, \~1.5 billion trades dating back from 2018 are available for viewing with little to no perceivable loading times. On disk, this translates into \~38 GB as of this writing.

\- Green bars represent buys, red bars represent sells. Each bar is an individual executed order. The size of a bar is based on the dollars traded and can be adjusted to help visualization.

\- Support for viewing live trades as they are executed on the exchange.

\- Filter trades based on price, volume or dollars traded.

\- Support for displaying various statistics. At the moment, I have basic price / volume histograms, but much more can be implemented.

\-----

**Implementation details:**

\- Language: C

\- Rendering API: OpenGL. A transition to D3D is planned.

\- RAM usage: about 7GB but I can likely bring that down.","self","https://redd.it/xwv979"

The thing is that for opening and closing kinda fast it works nicely, but it has some weird spikes sometimes that I don’t see in other apps or analysis, and weird steps in the price that suddenly change the price around 100btc . A different friend kinda explained why it happens and it made sense but I don’t really fully understand it, but i was lucky enough that I got one of those in my favor and i made 2kUSDT. Lucky me! But now I want to cash out and sent it to my binance wallet, and I get more red flags than the communist party.

For two days the transfer it’s been on hold, “Withdrawal Applying”, and it doesn’t get to my other wallet. I wrote to the costumer service several times and they barely answer any questions, just tell me to stop trading and wait. But all my trading funds are in the app and I am catching nice trends (sometimes because of the spikes I talked bout) and I don’t wanna miss a good chance just waiting, and they don’t tell me why. Previously they asked for a photo of me with my ID but they fixed nothing, and now they said as follows (BIGGEST RED FLAG SO FAR! 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

“Hello! You need to suspend trading and pay 30% of the total funds in your account as your risk margin to unlock your account.”

I am quite shocked and definitely lost on what to do, as I paid the fee for each transaction and this is as close to blackmail as I have ever seen. I’m even willing to pay to get my money but they are so slow to answer the chat logged out before the CS guy even answered how I should “pay” (there’s no option even close in the interface to solve this).

So I’m lost on what to do and I am getting sooooo many red flags vibes…

What do you guys think I should do? 

Also… Do you recommend any other app to change to after this? (Preferably to trade futures from the EU with low quantity, I’ve been looking for one since binance stopped supporting futures here) 


thank you guys in advance

EDIT: IT WAS A SCAM!!!

Yeah, you guessed it. My “friend” knows inside information from the app, and she purposely gave me bad trends (and I’m sure she manually changed a value in-App because the value went from 19.883 to 20.883 in a vertical jump as soon as I gave “confirmation” to invest short) and also she’s very mad I promised I’d have money ready but I made it trading on my own instead of transferring. 

But I’m not even mad! She taught me great investment skills and I made money!

But yeah, it’s dangerous to leave it out there. So, if you want to help the community and protect from scammers here’s the link to the app. You can give it bad reviews and download to report a scam.

***Remember Me?***

Guess who's back, the creator of DCAStack. I posted in this subreddit a year ago about a new project I was launching to help automate your DCA into bitcoin. It was met with a lot of skepticism and criticism which was valuable feedback.

So today I'm here to showcase the next generation of my project that enables ***Trustless, Transparent, Trading***. No more sharing API keys, no more revealing your personal information to strangers and no more trusting centralized exchanges. 

&nbsp;

***Why?***

I built this web app because I was so fed up with the lack of options in Dollar Cost Averaging. The current situation with DCA is:

* Centralized exchange fees to DCA are too high
* Trading bot websites need your API keys
* Give up complete custody of your funds with no transparency

And so, DCAStack was reborn.  Built for the community, open sourced and hoping to restore your purchasing power :)


&nbsp;

***How does it work?***


With the beauty of smart contracts, you no longer have to share your API keys with anyone to take advantage of dollar cost averaging tools. The best way to see DCA Stack is simply as an account you manage and fund to automate your dollar cost averaging schedules. 

To get started, you will need to deposit two things, gas and the token you want to sell to DCA into your desired token. So if you wanted to DCA into WBTC every day with 1 DAI (or any token/stablecoin) for 30 days, you would:

1.  Deposit 30 DAI (1 DAI x 30 trades)
2.  Deposit gas to cover 30 trades
3.  Let DCAStack do the rest! 


Here's what the dashboard looks like with an active schedule: https://i.imgur.com/XXJO7pf.png

Your funds are always liquid, so there are no lockups of any kind and you are free to withdraw any and all funds at your discretion. 

And here's the ability to manage your funds: https://i.imgur.com/3VnzREt.png

&nbsp;

***Note on Bugs :O***

There will be bugs and due to this simple fact, we have decided to launch on the goerli testnet to address them. With the community's help, we'd love to gather feedback and help resolve all of them so that we can launch a bug free version on a L2. 

Anyone who submits feedback that helps resolve a bug or a critical issue, will get free trading for when we decide to add a fee schedule (TBD). We'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, improvements and anything else you have for DCAStack so please chime in on discord :)","self","https://redd.it/y2afzk"

Long time lurker, first time poster. While we have been coping with the bear market I have been keeping my self busy on a little side project.

I figured out it could help some people here whom have a higher tendency towards trading. The project is a lightweight trading simulator designed for technically oriented traders. Core idea is to provide a platform to explore new trading/holding strategies.

Currently users can practice trading on 500 Binance listed coins/tokens including Bitcoin of course. Optionally users can choose SP500 listed stocks.

I'd love to hear your opinion on the implementation and if you have any new feature ideas, please let me know them. Project can be found from [app.tradebarracks.com](https://app.tradebarracks.com/) there is no ads or subscription, completely free :)

Cheers!","self","https://redd.it/ybdm56"

But how does it make a difference doing futures trade?

Here are some of my take aways on the time frame thing.

1. It refers to how long a trend lasts
2. Time frames are actionable right now for scalpers and doesn't interest day traders.
3. There are time frames that should be on your radar, especially those that can confirm a pattern, or otherwise.
4. Time frames ranges from seconds to minutes, hours, days and even weeks.

Once the underlying trend on an asset is identified, traders can now then execute their positions.

Here are examples how time frames are beneficial for users.

**Swing trader**\- Focuses on daily chart decisions or make use of weekly TF for the trend analysis.

**Day trader**\- could make use 15-minute chart up to 60-minute chart for short time trend analysis.

**Scalper-** could make use of lower TF, either that may be 15m, 5m, 1m, or 1s time frame due to highfrequency trading.


Since margin trading makes money out of either direction of the market, either long or short, the short-term chart can refine your entry and exit. A lot of information can be gathered in a short span of time that might influence your trading strategy.","self","https://redd.it/ydy6fq"

1. DCA - straight up dollar cost averaging. This is self explanatory (and not alternative)

It seems that most of those strategies are there simply by chance, if you test a sufficiently large number of strategies some of them will just work.

Some of them definitely don't work, US Congress Members have 45 days to make their trades public.

Some of them seem to work, for example, GitHub commits. I do understand that the quality of the code cannot be judged by the number of commits, but perhaps developers are the first ones to know that the project is not going well and they lose interest.","self","https://redd.it/ywt8qm"

Long time lurker, first time poster. While we have been coping with the bear market I have been keeping my self busy on a little side project.

I figured out it could help some people here whom have a higher tendency towards trading. The project itself is a lightweight trading simulator designed for technically oriented traders. Core idea is to provide a platform to explore new trading/holding strategies.

Currently users can practice trading on 500 Binance listed coins. Optionally users can choose SP500 listed stocks.

I'd love to hear your opinion on the implementation and if you have any new feature ideas, please let me know them. Project can be found from [app.tradebarracks.com](https://app.tradebarracks.com/) there is no ads or subscription, completely free :)

Cheers!","self","https://redd.it/zyy0zo"

reddit space as a writer but having discovered a number of things recently I feel that a discussion surrounding a new NFT Marketplace that has cropped up in the IOTA ecosystem that boasts big promises for the community and its users is warranted Advertising themselves as a community focused DAO platform that can support creators and communities the Soonaverse promise is huge But is it all just a ploy to inadvertently trap projects into their platform A quick read of their TOS brings up some scary truths Firstly we have to understand what the product actually is The DAO platform is an impressive tool kit and provides easy to create spaces which allow currently offchain voting within a DAO scenario all on the feeless IOTA network Looking good so far What has been turning heads recently is the pivot and focus towards an NFT Marketplace as the central hub of the platform To be clear this is not in fact an NFT Marketplace tokenization is not available on the IOTA Network yet So when you purchase an NFT on the Soonaverse platform you actually purchase a database entry that is stored in their records with a link to their IPFS file store Ownership is recorded as a data entry on the IOTA ledger which unfortunately is pruned over time So the only record of any ownership is held within their database For one individual project you can trust this seems viable but when you are dealing with millions of dollars worth of NFTs across hundreds of projects this alone sends up warning bells but still not malicious in any way This is clearly a current stop gap that can support early adoption leading towards the future releases of tokenization and smart contracts in the IOTA ecosystem Where do the warning flags go up then What drew my attention that created concerns to the projects very procommunity procreator stance is their Terms of Service ToS ToS are legal statements that support all of the terms relating to a users interaction with a website platform or application Soonaverse have one and it has clearly been written by a clever legal mind albeit somewhat Zuckerbergesque The concern here is when a platform dubs itself as the supporter of creators projects and buyers in the NFT space the ToS should reflect that Unfortunately in the case of the Soonaverse the majority of terms support only the Soonaverse platform and not the rights of others Lets take a look at some of the crazy terms contained within starting with the big money maker for the platform their Soonaverse NFT sale Lets look at the ownership of and rights to your SoonLabs NFT 2 LICENSES 21 License If you purchase or receive through a legitimate trade or sale a SoonLabs NFT SoonLabs grants you a nonexclusive nonsublicensable nontransferrable revocable limited license to use such SoonLabs NFT You may only use one of each SoonLabs NFT and do not have the right to make copies You agree that no title or ownership interest in a SoonLabs NFT is transferred or assigned to you and that the TOS is not a sale of any right to a SoonLabs NFT When you transfer sell or trade a SoonLabs NFT to another party that party shall receive a new license from SoonLabs covering the rights of that NFT and your rights to the NFT are revoked Highlighted in bold you never OWN your NFT you havent purchased it It is still owned by SoonLabs Which from a legal perspective means they can delete remove do whatever the hell they want with them at any time and you have no legal say in this matter This one speaks for itself And if you think thats bad enough how about spaces collections and creators on the Soonaverse platform This is the big one surrounding user created content ie NFTs collections spaces all data submissions images metadata projects DAOs etc created within the Soonaverse platform 23 User Content License User content includes any information that you create submit transmit or upload while using SoonLabs NFT for example Social Content any submissions comments questions testimonials tutorials advice suggestions ideas contest entries or other information you directly or indirectly provide to SoonLabs through any method existing now or in the future altogether User Content By providing User Content you represent and warrant that you have all consents licenses and rights necessary to provide and license the User Content and you grant SoonLabs a nonexclusive irrevocable fullypaid royaltyfree perpetual sublicensable transferrable worldwide license to User Content under all intellectual property and other rights you own or control to use broadcast disclose display distribute modify make derivative works of publicly perform publish record reproduce sublicense on multiple levels translate transmit or otherwise exploit for all purposes and in all formats and mediums and with any technology now known or hereafter developed and for all purposes without attribution notice permission or payment to you or a third party SoonLabs reserves the right to review edit delete or block access to User Content without notice Highlighted in bold you give SoonLabs a fully open license to all your IP They can do whatever they want with your project without your permission from making derivatives redistribution creating their own works reproduction sublicense they effectively own the rights to your project without your required consent This means that for ANY project on Soonaverse that has launched under these ToS Soonaverse can release further collections derivatives redistribute create merch sell on external platforms do anything with in any format for any purpose ie They could just make some money off anyones IP without any consent from the creator or IP owner This is not good for the hundreds of projects who have signed their IP over to Soonaverse but great for the Soonaverse platform If we go a little deeper we then reach the development concerns 46 Ongoing Development Although SoonLabs may describe future benefits and community development objectives we cannot guarantee that all the items including those described on the Website will be accomplished during the planned timeline as NFTs and blockchain technologies are new dynamic and complex Future developments listed on the Website or elsewhere are not included in any SoonLabs NFTs should not be taken into account while making any purchase or minting through the Service You accept that by using the Website and owning any SoonLabs NFTs you acknowledge that there are no explicit or implicit obligations for SoonLabs to undertake activities during the period of your control of a SoonLabs NFT to a change the form or functionality of the intellectual property associated with such NFT or b support or maintain any value of the intellectual property associated with such NFT Surprising that an NFT platform will not support and maintain any of the IP associated with NFTs on their platform What happens if SoonLabs stop paying the IPFS bill do all the NFTs just disappear Also the ability to change the form and functionality of any SoonLabs NFT is pretty crazy arent NFTs supposed to be unchangeable Yet more and more concerns that benefit no creator other than the Soonaverse platform Its a lot to take in but it just keeps getting better 62 Effect of Suspension or Termination Upon suspension or termination you acknowledge and agree that SoonLabs shall cease to provide access to a SoonLabs NFT and may delete data associated with your use of SoonLabs NFT You are not entitled to compensation of any kind as a result of suspension or termination regardless of whether effected by you or SoonLabs and SoonLabs is not liable to you or any third party for such suspension or termination and any related loss This is kind of an expansion on the standard we have the right to revoke the service at any time for violating our ToS or at our full discretion dont piss these guys off clause that is present in many ToS What this means is that if you are suspended or terminated from the platform as decided by the team you may lose ALL your NFTs all records of ever having owned them and they dont state what then happens to those NFTs although I would imagine they go into a Soonaverse pot How about we take another look at ownership 81 Ownership All right title and interest in and to the Service including but not limited to copyrights patents trademarks trade secrets trade names computer code source and object titles avatars animation audiovisual effects sound effects musical works look and feel methods of operation and items built within the Service by users are owned by SoonLabs SoonLabs reserves all rights in the Service Just in case you werent 100 sure they have all the rights and ownership to what you created and build within the Soonaverse be it an NFT Collection a DAO or anything they have been sure to put it in twice Just to be sure you clearly understand you have given up everything to their platform and company How about the protection of IP and violations This is of course the biggest issue for creators and should be at the forefront of the support system when building out a creator platform rightright 82 DMCA SoonLabs responds to notices alleging copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act the DMCA If you wish to make a DMCA claim you must provide the following information in writing in your DMCA notice a identify the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed b identify the material claimed to be infringing and where it is located c provide reasonably sufficient information to allow SoonLabs to contact you such as your address phone number and email address d provide a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or law e provide a statement made under penalty of perjury that the above information is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner and f provide an electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner SoonLabs may provide you notice if your communication post submission or upload was as a result of SoonLabs receiving a DMCA notice from a copyright owner If you receive notice from SoonLabs you may provide a counternotification in writing to SoonLabs designated DMCA agent through the means provided below DMCA notices can be sent by filling out an IP DMCA Request on GitHub or by mail SoonLabs NFTs Inc DMCA Notice 403134 Abbott Street Vancouver BC V6B 2K4 This may seem like a standard DMCA request form because it is But the concern here is many Firstly any request for IP removal has to be done off platform making it a complex and cumbersome task for individual creators or IP owners to make the first step in requesting removal of IP by which time damage could be done That isif you can actually make a request Which leads us on to their request form which is to submit to a public GitHub repository Now I am not sure if they understand privacy laws but forcing users to publish sensitive information to the public domain breaches this in many respects This immediately prevents IP owners from submitting take down requests and further supports IP infringement over the creator Last but not least they do present a second option to send them a letter Im not going to lie I laughed when I saw this this is hilarious When time sensitivity is of upmost importance in IP take down take OpenSea for example one form and usually a completed takedown within 1224hrs to mail and then wait for a response to then reply and then maybe get a result This is just a tragedy for IP owners and creators I hate to say it but with this evidence at hand it would appear the platform is far from a creator and community friendly project If anything it reads as a centralized attempt to gain control over an ecosystem market using traditional web 20 tactics of ownership of data and rights with little regard to the users of the platform These ToS benefit no one but the SoonLabs team Sorry Casters IOTApunks SheWeas Cribs Moonaco

further use besides looking awesome after the BEES airdrop Yes all Daobee Family NFTs Golden Daobee NFTs and even Daobee Coin Promo NFTs will all unlock exclusive cosmetic features on Daobee even after the BEES airdrop and also add points to your personal Honeymeter on Daobee which will unlock more and more features as it goes up Also the airdrop will happen in 2 phases At first 5 of all BEES will be directly airdropped to Daobee Family and Golden Daobee NFT holders After that another 10 of all BEES will be airdropped over the course of two years to NFT holders Can the NFTs that get created by Daobee players be transferred to other platforms and sold there Yes all NFTs will be 100 in your possession and you can do with them whatever you want transfer them wherever you want them trade sell etc What percentage of income from NFT auctions will be allocated to BEES stakers All ingame purchases on Daobee will be distributed to several parties both direct purchases and earnings from NFTauctions The preliminary distribution keys are described in this graphic x200B How much will the NFTs sell for on Soonaverse There will be 3750 Daobee Family NFTs 750 of each of the five Daobee Family characters each selling for 250 Mi Additionally there will be 100 Golden Daobee NFTs each selling for 999 Mi Since youve partnered with TangleSwap are there plans to list BEES on the TangleSwap DEX when Shimmer launches Yes we plan to list BEES on IOTA DeFi platforms like TangleSwap and ShimmerSeaTangleSea We will define all further details of this with our DeFi partners over the coming months Can you describe which kind of game Daobee will be Daobee will be a collaborative art creation game in which the created art will be sold as NFTs People will play in fastpaced postandvote games to create funny or beautiful stories pictures or memes together The resulting artwork is sold as an NFT which will automatically have utility on Daobee and 50 of the earnings will go to the players who created the NFT Will you include multichain support In its first iteration Daobee will only support Shimmer and IOTA networks This might be extended to other chains to after initial release What means EXTRA utility for partnering NFTs in some partner announcements All NFTs of partnering projects will unlock features on Daobee by adding to your personal Honeymeter In the announcements we sometimes wrote added extra or bonus utility for these NFTs however these all mean the same In the future some partners will have more extensive partnerships so that their NFTs will additionally have exclusive features on Daobee for example exclusive emoji sets Will the NFTs generated by the users be put up for auction on Soonaverse or will you have your own platform The full Daobee experience will happen directly on Daobee including NFT auctions However we are already in talks with partners that might enable connecting NFT auctions with their platforms so that their users will ALSO be able to bid on NFTs from their website while others bid from Daobee This feature is not confirmed yet though In the event that the NFT doesnt sell out what are the plans that the team have for the remaining NFTs The allocated 15 of all total BEES will be fully airdropped in case the NFTs are sold out If not all NFTs are sold out then less than 15 of all BEES will be airdropped accordingly For example if 80 of all Daobee Family NFTs gets sold then 12 of total BEES will be airdropped 80 of 15 The remaining BEES will stay in the Daobee growth and development fund so that they can be used to finance Daobee development The NFT sale will be open until shortly before the start of the BEES airdrop happening later this year People who play Daobee without a connected cryptowallet will they be able to receive tokens People who play without a connected wallet cannot earn while playing This will be one of the main mechanism of how Daobee will attract new audiences into IOTA Everybody can play for free but only those who connect a wallet will be able to earn What type of utility will we receive by holding NFTs from other partnersecosystem Daobee will be IOTAs first Layer2 NFT utility provider This means that NFTs of partnering projects will unlock features on Daobee by adding points to your personal Honeymeter We already partnered with large parts of the IOTA NFT ecosystem and will continue to do so with other projects You can find all our partners here daobeeio My question relates to the TangleSwap NFTs and the unlocking of features regarding DAOBEE Seeing as how these NFTs are to be staked within the DEX ecosystem in so called docking stations how are these NFTs to be used in unlocking features in the DAOBEE ecosystem From a technical perspective if you stake your NFTs on the TangleSwap platform they leave your wallet This means that Daobee cannot see them in your wallet anymore and cannot confirm that you own them We will however talk to TangleSwap and see if there are workarounds so that Daobee can still know which NFT belongs to which person in order to unlock features for them Where can one buy IOTA token The answers depends on in which country you reside in A guide on how to buy IOTA tokens can be found here

community voice even matter in IOTA community treasury governance A lot of discussion has surfaced surrounding IOTA community governance these past few months The raising of the Shimmer token supply was a great illustration of the power community voting has and the dispersal of these tokens 10 of the supply to the Tangle Ecosystem Association TEA and 10 to the community DAO fund was clearly publicised and voted upon Yet now still without a community DAO formed still without Smart Contracts and still without 100 on chain voting another proposal has been presented that is attempting a move to strip the community DAO of 50 of the community treasury fund and place them in control of the TEA in what some may say is a swayed pseudo governance move You may not have heard about this vote unlike the previous community votes there has been no blog no public announcements just some quietly publicised posts in the favourable IF Discord and with only 132 people currently voting on the outcome does the overall community even get a say x200B Original Proposal Vote Outcome after 7 days ONLY 132 VOTES So what is the proposal all about The proposal is built upon the need to rush into action and use up all the funds as quick as possible There is a lot of FOMO speech about this is the end the time to act is now if we dont we will fail It presents an IOTA Foundation swayed committee that will specifically assess IOTA Foundation proposals on the allocation of funds and decide the allocation of these funds under NDA with zero guidelines for transparency or accountability to the community Anyone who has been in business or has signed an NDA understands that transparency is easily maintained despite NDAs being in place x200B More interesting to discover is that this proposal has been put forward not by the community but by IOTA Foundation director and leader of the board Dominik Schiener this is after Dom had previously stated that the IF would never look to use or control the Community DAO treasury x200B With the TEA already receiving 10 of the Shimmer supply it begs to question why do they now require half of the community treasury on top of this already community voted on windfall Dom recently revealed the IF financial status again in Discord that raised a few eyebrows The current financial status of the IOTA Foundation Theres no secret the IF are selling their entire IOTA holdings to fund operations for the foreseeable future but an interesting note to observe in his release of the IF balance is that 30 of the Shimmer tokens dispersed to the TEA has already been allocated With the current market downtrend this has resulted in the TEA burning through these in just two months and leaving the TEA with less money to throw about than they had hoped If the Shimmer supply the TEA has been issued is being used up at such a pace then it is apparent the current supply the TEA holds doesnt support its original plans despite the IF saying that they are okay with operations and their plans for the Shimmer launch It is here that we arrive at the current turn of events Despite saying the IF would never attempt to use or control the community DAO funds the first act in community governance even before the community has had a chance to establish a DAO entity and even before Smart Contracts and secure onchain voting arrive Dominik Schiener founder of the IF has put it upon himself to go against all previous community votes and use his influence to transfer control of 50 of the entire community treasury to under the TEAs control for use over the next 12 months This would leave the community treasury with just 35 of its entire allocation by the end of the first 12 months You can read Doms original proposal here as you will see this proposal only had 132 votes because it was primarily presented in the Discord which is but a small portion of the IOTA and Shimmer communities so the lack of exposure presented an extremely small voting turn out the majority of which are devout supporters of Dom Interestingly enough though during the past week the community presented a counterproposal to this original one which can be viewed here Even though the premise of the original proposal by Dom is dubious the community counter proposal continued by endorsing Doms original yet provided a more community friendly approach and resulted in a similar voting turn out in half the amount of time with very different results The results of the counterproposal vote after 3 days The main points of observation are as follows The funding allocation is to be lowered to 35 of the community funds over the original 50 This would leave the community DAO with at least 50 of their token supply by the end of the first year allowing the DAO to establish order and a financial model that can carry it into the future This also doesnt affect the proposal in any way as is pointed out by the fact the community can always vote to allocate further funds to the committee if it operates in the communitys best interests over the first 6 months It not only provides financial security for the DAO but also the flexibility of evaluating the value of the Shimmer Growth Committee over its first six months Change the committee to four community representatives and one IOTA Foundation representative as opposed to the three community representatives and two IOTA Foundation representatives in the original proposal This is simply logical every vote needs a majority and naturally all IF members will vote yes on every IF proposal creating a stacked voting system from day one Having a community committee of just three means even if two of the three community vote a majority against a proposal it will still be carried through because IF dominates With a 4 to 1 it would require at least 50 of the communitys representatives to agree for it to pass Add transparency guidelines One clear omission from the original proposal is that there are no clear guidelines for transparency and accountability yet a lot of bluster about NDAs and how we cant tell the community everything NDAs are all good and well they protect business interests and trade secrets and a whole lot of other sensitive exposure What is important to understand though is this does not in any way prevent transparency As the counter proposal outlines transparency of the allocation of treasury funds and their use is simple to share with the community without releasing sensitive information pertaining to NDAs One other interesting note to make is there is actually another clause that has not been heavily discussed but definitely an important one That the IOTA Foundation or the Tangle Ecosystem Association will not attempt to use or apply for the use of the funds In Doms original proposal there is no mention of this direct use of the funds for the IF or TEAs benefit or interests but this also protects the funds from being used for operations or business requirements there should be no need for this if the IF have the amount of money Dom previously disclosed The clause for preventing the IF or TEA directly making use of the community funds Overall these additional changes provide a certainly more community friendly approach and it is good to see that the community is engaging in governance discussion and counterproposals that may provide a more sustainable future for the DOA treasury fund whilst still supporting ambiguous initiatives that may not serve the communitys interests over those of the foundation x200B The main alterations to Doms original proposal as presented by the community counter proposal But how was it received Instead of supporting open community governance and the discussion surrounding the proposal a direct attack on the author of the counter proposal illustrated that Dom had zero interest in engaging in the discussion x200B Dom instead of entering into the discussion poses simple personal attacks on the author denouncing community involvement in the discussions and decisions Vilifying the author within the community in an attempt to discredit the application and outright refusing to discuss a single point on the topic but continually attacking the opposition of his original plan Dom shared he had no intentions of actually engaging in community led governance x200B Despite a community member actually stepping up and doing something about the proposal it was clearly dismissed by Dom who continued to refuse to actually discuss the proposal at all It is a shame that this is the response individuals can expect when entering alternative proposals and objective opinions This will in no doubt result in less people wanting to get involved and have their say for fear of pariahism in the community The important thing about community governance is that the community has a voice Objective opinions are discussed and a fair voting outcome is achieved Why then at the first opportunity for the community to enter an alternative is this so heavily shot down This sort of rhetoric is common in politics the use of defamation to turn voters against the opposition but it can also say a lot about the instigator Why did Dom feel the need just go for the kill instead of enter into discussion surrounding the proposal x200B From an outsider perspective irrelevant of the author the counterproposal holds a lot of merit and actually makes sense It provides a foundation for the future of the community DAO and demonstrates caution in allocating too much to an initiative in the early stages of the governance It also favours the community voice rather than having an IF dominant committee But with such outburst from professionals leading the Foundation it begs the question Does community voice even matter x200B There is currently a public vote active on the community governance forum website on which of these proposals moves forward You can read both proposals here and make up your mind on which one should be carried through to a token vote in Firefly in the new year

One of the key takeaways from the series should be just how simple IOTA’s new consensus mechanism actually is: it’s just an adaptation of Satoshi Nakamoto’s longest chain wins principle but with new design decisions that make it likely impossible with the known laws of physics to design a more efficient consensus mechanism. 

Comparing the classical Nakamoto consensus to this new many-worlds version is like comparing a rotary telephone to an iPhone 13 or a horse and buggy to a formula on race car.

It is time the distributed ledger community begins to understand the true depth of what’s been built by the IOTA community in the wake of its strategic mistakes, bad PR, and false promises.

I created a community driven website to track if exchanges currently allow the withdrawal of IOTA. You can visit it here:

[https://iotaexchangestatus.canreal.net/](https://iotaexchangestatus.canreal.net/)

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer:**

I'm not a dev and not a web designer. Therefore, the website is very basic due to being a hobby/learning project. Also, I'm sure that full time devs could improve a lot of my code but at least it works. Because of that I published the code on GitHub: [https://github.com/braydofficial/iotaexchangestatus](https://github.com/braydofficial/iotaexchangestatus) It stores your IP combined with your vote for 24 hours and clears the MySQL table at 12am German time every day. If more than 20% vote for suspended withdrawal of an exchange a warning gets displayed. Due to storing the IP for 24 hours voting is only possible once a day from this IP.

Why not fetch the data from the exchanges API? -> Not all exchanges allow to check if withdrawal is possible via their API. That's why it relies on your votes at the moment. The more of you vote, the better it is.

&#x200B;

I wasn't 100% sure which exchanges listed on the official IOTA website are allowing withdrawal in general. That's why currently every exchange listed on the IOTA website is listed on the status page, too.

I also added KuCoin to my status page.

If any exchange isn't listed that has withdrawal enabled in general please tell me here or on GitHub so I can add them ASAP.

&#x200B;

If you're a developer you can always fork the repo and improve it or contribute directly to the repo. Please respect the license, so that everything that is built from my small hobby project here is also publicly available for everyone in the community and stays Open Source. :)

**Stake address generation could be handled separately, in two consecutive steps, so we would be 100% sure the stake address is generated from our seed.**

Currently, when you stake, your funds are being transferred to a seemingly random address which I could not make sure if it wa a self address or not, so I just 100% trusted the software.

One thing I like about hardware wallets is the ability to verify receive addresses right on the hardware, so one can be sure the on screen address matches the seed generated wallet address, and a two-step (consecutively so as not to complicate the process more) stake process would better match that workflow, and could aid in increasing awareness for security, esp. if in future more sites could ask you to send your iota to other addresses, at least hardware users would better differentiate between a potential scam or a IF sanctioned soft-stake for other possible future tokens.

Iota is great for IoT applications. However, with increasing use and popularity of Iota, its value will also increase. As I believe (not 100% sure though) that buying Iota is necessary to create new applications and use-cases, will this this be a barrier to entry for start-ups and emerging organizations, as they cannot afford to buy as much Iota as needed for their project? Will this diminish the incentive to use Iota?

Let us imagine a bunch of driver-less cars plying on a road, with the ability to trade iota. You are one of the passengers, and you are running 10 minutes late for work. So you instruct your car to move faster. Your car has an AI which communicates with the neighboring cars and pays them all a few iota each to make room as needed, whenever possible. Then all the car AIs together device a plan which makes it possible for all cars to coordinate and move in a way that your car ends up moving faster. You reach your destination on time at the cost of 2 miota. You grumble, but you don't mind it much.

Other passengers, who left their cars in ""compliance mode"" to let people like you go ahead, receive a little bit of iota each time someone goes by. Your punctual coworker Bill, who started from home on time (as usual), made 2 miota overall from this today, and he is happy. You see him swap a miota at your office coffee machine, and he stares at you while sipping it.

Now, for each person, this would involve thousands of micro transactions to give/make a couple of bucks. Only a fee-less system such as iota could make this possible.","self","https://redd.it/rz1sy0"

As mentioned, I have decided to support IOTA ecosystem with my knowledge.

Before a few weeks, I've created a post about a poker game I'm developing. The first version of the game is completed and I've already done some alpha internal testing. To catch as many bugs as possible before real tokens can be deposited/withdrawn, I have decided to make public testing where anyone can check the game and test it with the IOTA dev net tokens.

Test phase 1 will last from Jan 9, 11 PM until Jan 12, 11 PM (GMT+01) (Sunday-Wednesday). After and during test phase 1,  I'll fix any major bugs that are found. If the game is stable after test phase 1, I'll prepare a production release next week, otherwise, there will be a test phase 2. The issues/feedback can be reported on the Github repo (link available in the comments).

For testing purposes, this version has fees enabled which are 5% per winner's hand. In the production version, the fees will be disabled, I'll rely completely on your donations for the start (it can be changed later). So if you like this game and want to support the development of this game and possibly some other projects I have on my mind, feel free to donate to this address:

**iota1qrss8vtul7jsp0qx2ds7t0xyvrqyt4fan3zraaeuwrqjv4h08522vdcd33j**

In the comments, I'll add a link to the roadmap where you can vote for the features you would like to see first implemented in the game.

There are 6 tables with different values for small/big blinds for now. The game has the option to kick a player on a move if a player is idle for 30 seconds.

Thanks until next post","self","https://redd.it/s03zqd"

ISSUE - Firefly opens but is offscreen, unusable and inaccessible. 

When I open firefly it opens, appears on the task bar correctly and can be seen to be on the login menu when you hover the mouse, but attempting to minimize and maximize it constantly ""opens"" offscreen, has seen by the split second animation of the window shooting offscreen.

Thanks in advance for your answers and for the patience of people like me who want to be part of this great community and continue to grow:

1- After 90 days of IOTA staking on Firefly is over, will it be possible to continue staking ASMB and SMR on the same Firefly app?

2- Staking IOTA and in the future ASMB and SMR, will it be like being a validator on other networks?  (for example as ETH with its 32 eth to be a validator)

3- I would also like to know if locking IOTA on Firefly (in addition to SMR and ASMB) is similar to locking Etherum 2.0.  In other words, benefits will be obtained (network security, fees, mana...) for leaving them blocked.

4- I have read on the SMR and ASMB websites that either you can stake both tokens to obtain passive benefits or you can choose the option of being VALIDATORS.  Of the latter, it does not indicate anywhere how we can make it possible (if with a rasperry pi node, or if a more powerful equipment will be needed...). And, on the latter too, if there is any tutorial for dummies on how to be a validator and thus obtain more profits.

Thanks again for your time and patience with the new ones.  If an answer isn't possible here, I'll post questions directly on Discord.  Thanks","self","https://redd.it/s4m1rk"

yQue has been working on making cool trucker hats to display iota receiving addresses for some time, but we have now created a supporting interface with high security to allow the owner of the hat to control the content on the page and post their own receiving address.

These hats can be pre-loaded with iota or not. They will be available for different colors, etc.... but for now we are testing the security and concept of the wearable payment system interface. Once we launch the product yQue will offer $100 USD in iota plus a free hat to whoever is the first to crack the security and modify the QR Code of an account. I will repost when that contest starts with the prototype.  I put an example of the current interface below and that page links to the page to buy the hat, although we aren't currently shipping the hats for another week, so don't try to order one yet.

What is IOTA hat?

A no signup reference landing page platform embedded with iota payments used for wearables that binds your digital clone with a physical one. Physical wearables like hats, coins or shirts are tied to a webpage that connects to the Firefly wallet allowing micro-transactions, offers a bulletin board and redirects to other platforms, NFTs and any endpoint. The password to the landing page is printed inside the hat and is not a replacement for a secure wallet like firefly, but an introductary product for promotion and educational purposes.","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/j7wxKYqLGGzYH3bac_WZKzAooFxita3Vp8gUwNezj5M.jpg","https://redd.it/s5pbii"

I am holding IOTA and some other cryptos for quite a while now but IOTA is by far the biggest disappointment (and i am not even considering price action).

First and foremost the System is not decentralized even after the 4 years that i am following this project. Yes yes.. Coordicide is on its way but it is not here!

The change to IOTA 2.0 was a mess. Token migration did not work very well for me. I also lost a small amount (some kIota) on my mobile wallet. It did not let me migrate those tokens because apparently some kIota is a to small amount?! Also there is no mobile wallet for IOTA 2.0?! Why? Did we migrate to an even less useful system?!

Currently i am trying to stake my tokens. I am writing this post while i am waiting for my wallets to sync! TO SYNC! i have only sent one transaction since the migration. What is there to sync and why would it take 20 mins? All restarting and so on does not help it keeps syncing. And once it is done syncing and i get to where i finally can stake iota and i click the stake button, it does not do anything. Well i actually dont know what is happening in the background but because i am not informed about it. I can only sit here and wait and may be click the button for another time and wait. i now have staked 3 of my wallets and it took me well beyond 30 minutes.

There are a lot of other things that bug me about this project. If 2022 is not the year IOTA will shine i will sell my tokens. it is a sad thing but i am almost done.","self","https://redd.it/s639gy"

We have been developing a gaming platform for crypto games in which players can earn instant and feeless crypto prizes during the gameplay. We are already integrating a number of instant and feeless cryptocurrencies. Someone ın a recent Reddit post asked us if we are considering IOTA as another payment asset, that's why I wanted to check in with the IOTA community if it would interest you guys. 

You can see the platform on [https://wodo.io](https://wodo.io) and check out the documentation for more details about the technology to see if IOTA is a good fit in your opinion. 

Your feedback is very important to us, would be great to hear your opinion about the subject.

Thanks to everyone who participated in the beta testing of my IOTA poker game.  
Since the testing phase started, several bugs have been fixed and new features introduced.  
The game has been updated with audio and table chat features, I'll keep adding and improving the game.

Finally, I can say that the first version of the game is completed and I decided to put it on the mainnet.  
The link to the IOTA poker game is available in the comments.  
Also, I decided to keep the test version running for everyone who is interested in testing the latest features.

The game will have 5% rake because it can not be run on the current donations alone (less than 50Mi, thanks to everyone who wanted to help that way).

Also, I created two tutorials that show how to deposit/withdraw tokens in the game, all the links are in the comments.

1. Privacy - This is a huge concern, no one wants to have their entire bank statement available for the world to read. Even in the machine to machine economy, it would enable some forms of corporate espionage. Is IOTA just going to be open book?

2. Deflationary - As every IOTA has been distributed, the currency is currently deflationary. This incentivizes holding the token and not spending it. How is IOTA going to battle this? Purely on the fact that it could potentially do something for the machine2machine economy that they cant get elsewhere? But then thats admitting that it will never be used for person to person spending.

3. Malware in NFT's - This one is slightly less of a concern, but I've heard of the possibility of malware being including into NFT's and sent to random wallets in the hope of being activated. Does IOTA have a way of stopping this?

Around the start of staking, the number of active addresses peaked around 30,000 /day. Additionally, in January there were two rounds of Tanglelabs NFT sales (due to issues with the first round, the sale was resumed two weeks later).

&#x200B;

[Around 2.5 k active addresses on a normal day in January](https://preview.redd.it/4dn6340bbhg81.png?width=3359&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d1afc3b70e5a597a449f252afd01047df372ef)

An address can be associated with a person, but also with an exchange/broker. Some exchanges use one address for their hot wallet, others use a large number of addresses.

&#x200B;

The number of active addresses is a good indicator of the degree of use of a network, and with that the value of it. The current level is similar to that of Ethereum in early January 2016. At the time, Ethereum had a market capitalization of about $100 mln. Does this mean IOTA is currently overvalued, or that Ethereum was undervalued at the time? Earlier this year, Dominik Schiener set a goal for IOTA to reach 10% of Ethereum's active addresses by the end of this year (can't find the source of that anymore). This corresponds to 50,000 active addresses per day, more than one and a half times the peak of December 21, and more than 20 times the average of the end of January. Ambitious, but not impossible I guess. Reason enough for me to keep monitoring this parameter the coming months. 

What do you think is an important indicator to assess the state of IOTA's network?","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/g50oeEPq5Jg4LQBIL4tKBArTt_sv_ssvtVyZ1bC8bak.jpg","https://redd.it/sn1mqr"

I have bought some IOTA back in the day with the 81 character seed.

In the meantime I bought a ledger nano S and saw that I can add IOTA to my HW wallet, nice!

Then the new firefly app came out, converted my ""old"" IOTA, nice!

Now I have a second ledger nano S and want to create a new wallet and send all the IOTA there.

I downloaded the firefly app on a second PC and connected my new ledger to it.

Create new wallet --> hardware wallet --> done (WHAT?)

&#x200B;

Is the 81 character seed gone? Don't I need it anymore?

&#x200B;

What I want is the following:

Create a new IOTA wallet with a seed (81 char. or 24 words, what is correct?) and being able to sign transactions with my new ledger nano s.

I don't want to lose my funds if my ledger nano s gets destroyed or so.

How to achieve this? 

Thank you very much in advance for your help!","self","https://redd.it/sru310"

“This was one of the biggest things iota promoted when it happened and now it’s dead.”

Dom: 


“I think you misunderstand how adoption of new technologies happens. It is done through trial and error, and working in many different directions to figure out what actually makes sense. Up until recently everyone in crypto was exploring  different avenues to drive adoption from outside. Our core assumption was that companies / governments would be the main drivers of adoption, and that they would help us progress with the technology development on all levels (Protocol, L2, modules / extensions, and obviously use cases). 

After all these years, and especially with the rise of DeFi, NFTs and tokenization, it's obvious that the adoption is not being driven from outside our ecosystem - but from within. Therefore, for IOTA it is crucial that we focus on being a leader in the crypto space, and not just focus on enterprise adoption. This is why the Stardust upgrade is so crucial, as we are introducing Tokenization, Output Types, NFTs and Smart Contracts to IOTA. Just look at how much our ecosystem has grown already just by having a Testnet. 

TangleEE is the perfect example of this needed change in focus for us. It was born out of the assumption that enterprise partners want a dedicated working group to engage and build together. But after 2 years with minimal output (it was mostly information sharing), shutting it down to focus on different initiatives makes the most sense. Overall, the setting itself wasn't the right one. Eclipse is mainly to drive open source development, which we did not want as our code governance should be done together with our community (through TIPs, voting, etc.), and not through a working group hosted by an external foundation. Using Eclipse to drive use cases and foster this co-creation between companies didn't make much sense.

Obviously this has no impact on all the partnerships and collaborations we still have with big companies that were part of the working group. This was a joint decision by everyone in TangleEE, and everyone's happy about the direction that IOTA is taking with the technology and the focus on utility through Stardust and Assembly.”

Random discorder #2:

kinda verifies my feeling about how the IF shifted towards attracting degen DeFi traders vs real world adoption

Dom:

“that assumption is correct. Our focus is on driving adoption in the crypto space by increasing the utility of IOTA and its token. That is why we have the Stardust upgrade, and that is why we have launched the Shimmer and Assembly networks. 

Crypto has become real world adoption, and large companies are actually very excited about using NFTs and even exploring stablecoin uses for their treasuries. We are in a perfect position to offer IOTA as the network to build these use cases. 

Enterprise adoption right now is still being pursued, especially EBSI, but our focus is on empowering our ecosystem to build dApps in DeFi, NFTs and other smart contract use cases.”

Random discorder #3:

“Enterprises not interested in the tech? is it too early?”

Dom:

“mix of both I would say. These working groups always need some individuals to step up and lead the effort. Because we didn't do actual open source development through it and more just use case exploration, there was not enough engagement. All of the companies work with us directly anyways, so using TangleEE as a forum to engage / discuss / collaborate wasn't the right setting.”

Random discorder #4:

It's gotten quite silent about iotas coordicide lately. We are working on stuff like smart contracts, DeFi, shimmer and assembly.

All hype is generated about ""stake your tokens"", ""develop on top of smart contracts"" and over and over ""we have yet another project with zebra"". The last real update on decentralization has been months ago.

I get that the shimmer network is meant as some kind of ""testnet"" for the IOTA network. However, the roadmap doesn't receive any updates, regarding coordicide anymore: [https://roadmap.iota.org/coordicide](https://roadmap.iota.org/coordicide). It's nice to have a testnet - but it doesn't give us progress in the first place aka ""only because BMW has a test room for vehicles, it doesn't mean their emmisions get better"".

**IMHO**

In my opinion, coordicide is by far the most important step for acceptance, at least on the market.

As long as the IF has the big red ""stop everything""-button in their hands, there will not be any real world adoption. It just doesn't follow the core concept of decentralization in crypto. If the market doesn't accept the currency, it won't get any reputation, due to the lack of m-cap and to be honest ""because it's being memed on"" (due to being centralized).

A company that doesn't consider crypto, or is only starting with it, won't chose #50, measured by m-cap.

We're talking about DeFi and dApps - but guess what the ""D"" stands for. And no kids, I'm very sorry, it's not what you think.

I understand, that there are different teams, having different skillsets. I'm not asking to move a ""web designer"", that makes a fancy website to developing on coordicide. But what the hell - we are waiting FOR YEARS and yet, we get everything except the one thing, that would actually get us to the next level.

What do you guys think?","self","https://redd.it/tb0h0c"

So far coordicide is still years off, 
there has been very little adoption (retail nor industry), not much progress on some of the big exchanges, still no governance voting. The IF are now focusing (for the foreseeable future) on the smart contract/ NFTs which is already steaming full of competitors and VC backed projects with a lot more money, resource and a lot better suited commercial structure to compete than the IF. 

The NFT trend also seems to be losing steam and attention. Is this not just the ICO boom bust of 2017 all over again, for which the IF are late to the party.These Dex’s and liquidity pools seem to be over complicated Ponzi schemes, many either rugpull or are unsustainable and collapse after 6 months, with only the owners profiting. Not a space that is going to sweep IOTA into mass adoption.

It all just seems a bit messy. That said, there are plenty of positives as well with DID, Firefly, EBSI and the protocol is certainly getting more smooth and user friendly, and the IF foundation must of have one of the largest teams in the space. There is a still a lot of promise.

So, if a basic Assembly is coming later in 2022 (we all know that most likely will be November or December) the full release will come soon, but clearly not in 2022. 

Not trying to spread fud, but I do have more and more worries, look at the 2021 roadmap :

Q1: Chrysalis 

Q2: Tokenomics 

Q3: Smart Contracts 

Q4: Coordicide 

\--------

What did we get from this ?(just Chrysalis) . 2022 roadmap , supposed to be the year of iota, will see in the best-case scenario :

Q1: End of staking, and nothing else.

Q2+Q3: Shimmer (optimistic future)

Q4: basic Assembly 

Coordicide ? No idea !

\----

Now my question is, in any kind of work, internal ETA's should make people to take resposability for a failure,but in IF,we seen Dom telling us many things that proved to be fake,and we see Navin trolling on discord (at least my impression of his personality, -I deliver few kids- ,one of his memorable replics on discord),so right now we have 2 people in charge...that don't really inspire credibility.","self","https://redd.it/tomt7t"

- Shimmer will launch in about 8 weeks AT THE EARLIEST, if no bugs are found  but probably much later

- staking of shimmer and assembly tokens won't be possible until after release of the networks (see above)

- we can continue to stake IOTA for asmb (less rewards than before), starting in a couple of weeks presumably.","self","https://redd.it/tqi4e3"

**Staking**

Staking Assembly should be re-enabled in a week or two. 

**Shimmer Testnet Launch**

Shimmer testnet will be released soon and then the Shimmer mainnet will be launched a few weeks after as they need to give it enough time to test and debug it (Dom said it would be a minimum 4 weeks from testnet launch until Shimmer mainnet launch but probably longer). Personal view- I’d expect 2-3 months at least. 

**Assembly launch**

When asked if Assembly will be released within the next 21 months. Dom stated it will be launched quicker than 21 months. Assembly will start off as a single chain (like an EVM chain) and then it will be upgraded to a multi chain smart contract network in due course. 

A roadmap post explaining Assembly and Shimmers launch will be released this/ next week. 

**IOTA Foundation Funding**

The IF is funded mainly through the treasury and grants at the moment. Personal view- I thought they had stopped selling tokens? 

It is also now funded through the private sale of Assembly to VC’s. 

The IF plan to start operating asset management to stake and yield farm some of its funds in the treasury to get 10-15% yield which will help create a revenue stream. 

The initial aim was to be sustainable via grants. For example they have a few million euros from EBSI over the next few years. But obtaining grants takes too much time, are resource heavy and not sustainable. So, the IF have decided to stop with this strategy.

In summary, Dom has no worries about the IF’s sustainability and this should improve going forward with the release of Shimmer and Assembly ecosystems.

**Dom on trip to America**

Close to signing agreements with custody providers and liquidity providers. 

Dom has had a lot of discussions with big Dapps from ETH, Avax, FTM who are excited as they realise that they could have a lot of success in IOTA ecosystem as well. This is because the IOTA community is one of the most engaged community. He stated they have seen the proportion of IOTA that was staked and that billions were effectively locked in TVL due to the current staking for ASMB and SMR. Dapps want a piece of this action. 

**Coordicide**

Coordicide won’t be on the mainnet this year. It’s not possible as it needs to be tested for quite a few months on Shimmer first. It is possible that Coordicide will be on Shimmer this year. They hope it may be but this is not clear at this stage. 

**Transparency**

When asked about transparency. Dom said they are one of the most transparent projects. You can go into discord in any channel and directly interact with devs. 

He said that sometimes there is soo much information it’s hard for them to package it up and present it to the community. Things are fast moving and sometimes they are moving onto the next thing that it wastes time to go back and explain things. 

He thinks they lack staff in the area and he said they are “staffing up”. He asked for any suggestions on spreading this information. 

**Governance Vote**

Governance vote likely to be before the Shimmer network launches 

On the transparency point above, I am thinking of starting an IOTA podcast soon would anyone be interested to listen? Or is the IOTA podcast market too saturated with Moonaco and IOTA Weekly currently killing it.","self","https://redd.it/tqv9jy"

Advertising themselves as a community focused DAO platform that can support creators and communities the Soonaverse promise is huge. But is it all just a ploy to inadvertently trap projects into their platform? A quick read of their TOS brings up some scary truths.

Firstly, we have to understand what the product actually is. The DAO platform is an impressive tool kit and provides easy to create spaces which allow (currently off-chain) voting within a DAO scenario, all on the feeless IOTA network. Looking good so far.

What has been turning heads recently is the pivot and focus towards an NFT Marketplace as the central hub of the platform. To be clear, this is not in fact an NFT Marketplace, tokenization is not available on the IOTA Network yet. So, when you purchase an NFT on the Soonaverse platform you actually purchase a database entry that is stored in their records with a link to their IPFS file store. Ownership is recorded as a data entry on the IOTA ledger, which unfortunately is pruned over time. So, the only record of any ownership is held within their database.

For one individual project you can trust this seems viable - but when you are dealing with millions of dollars’ worth of NFTs across hundreds of projects this alone sends up warning bells, but still not malicious in any way. This is clearly a current stop gap that can support early adoption leading towards the future releases of tokenization and smart contracts in the IOTA ecosystem.

Where do the warning flags go up then?

What drew my attention that created concerns to the projects very pro-community, pro-creator stance is their Terms of Service (ToS). ToS are legal statements that support all of the terms relating to a user’s interaction with a website, platform, or application. Soonaverse have one and it has clearly been written by a clever legal mind – albeit somewhat Zuckerberg-esque. 

The concern here is, when a platform dubs itself as the supporter of creators, projects and buyers in the NFT space the ToS should reflect that. Unfortunately, in the case of the Soonaverse the majority of terms support only the Soonaverse platform and not the rights of others.

Let’s take a look at some of the crazy terms contained within, starting with the big money maker for the platform their Soonaverse NFT sale.

Let’s look at the ownership of and rights to your SoonLabs NFT.

>***2. LICENSES***  
>  
>***2.1 License.***  *If you purchase, or receive through a legitimate trade or sale, a SoonLabs NFT, SoonLabs grants you a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, revocable, limited license to use such SoonLabs NFT.  You may only use one of each SoonLabs NFT and do not have the right to make copies.* ***You agree that no title or ownership interest in a SoonLabs NFT is transferred or assigned to you and that the TOS is not a sale of any right to a SoonLabs NFT.***  *When you transfer, sell or trade a SoonLabs NFT to another party, that party shall receive a new license from SoonLabs covering the rights of that NFT and your rights to the NFT are revoked.*

Highlighted in bold – you never OWN your NFT, you haven’t purchased it. It is still owned by SoonLabs. Which from a legal perspective means they can delete, remove, do whatever the hell they want with them at any time, and you have no legal say in this matter. This one speaks for itself.

And, if you think that’s bad enough, how about spaces, collections, and creators on the Soonaverse platform? This is the big one surrounding user created content i.e., NFTs, collections, spaces, all data, submissions, images, metadata, projects, DAOs, etc. created within the Soonaverse platform.

>***2.3*** ***User Content License.***  *User content includes any information that you create, submit, transmit or upload while using SoonLabs NFT, for example, Social Content, any submissions, comments, questions, testimonials, tutorials, advice, suggestions, ideas, contest entries or other information you directly or indirectly provide to SoonLabs through any method existing now or in the future (altogether, “****User Content****”).  By providing User Content you represent and warrant that you have all consents, licenses and rights necessary to provide and license the User Content and* ***you grant SoonLabs a non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, perpetual, sub-licensable, transferrable, worldwide license to User Content under all intellectual property and other rights you own or control to use, broadcast, disclose, display, distribute, modify, make derivative works of, publicly perform, publish, record, reproduce, sublicense (on multiple levels), translate, transmit or otherwise exploit for all purposes and in all formats and mediums and with any technology now known or hereafter developed and for all purposes without attribution, notice, permission or payment to you or a third party.***  *SoonLabs reserves the right to review, edit, delete or block access to User Content without notice.*

Highlighted in bold – you give SoonLabs a fully open license to all your IP. They can do whatever they want with your project, without your permission - from making derivatives, redistribution, creating their own works, reproduction, sublicense, they effectively own the rights to your project, without your required consent.

This means that for ANY project on Soonaverse that has launched under these ToS Soonaverse can release further collections, derivatives, redistribute, create merch, sell on external platforms, do anything with, in any format, for any purpose – i.e. They could just make some money off anyone’s IP - without any consent from the creator or IP owner.

This is not good for the hundreds of projects who have signed their IP over to Soonaverse, but great for the Soonaverse platform. If we go a little deeper, we then reach the development concerns

>***4.6*** ***Ongoing Development.***  *Although SoonLabs may describe future benefits and community development objectives, we cannot guarantee that all the items, including those described on the Website, will be accomplished during the planned timeline as NFTs and blockchain technologies are new, dynamic and complex.  Future developments, listed on the Website or elsewhere are not included in any SoonLabs NFTs should not be taken into account while making any purchase or minting through the Service.*  ***You accept that by using the Website and owning any SoonLabs NFTs, you acknowledge that there are no explicit or implicit obligations for SoonLabs to undertake activities during the period of your control of a SoonLabs NFT to: (a) change the form or functionality of the intellectual property associated with such NFT; or (b) support or maintain any value of the intellectual property associated with such NFT.*** 

Surprising that an NFT platform will not support and maintain any of the IP associated with NFTs on their platform. What happens if SoonLabs stop paying the IPFS bill, do all the “NFTs” just disappear? Also, the ability to change the form and functionality of any SoonLabs NFT is pretty crazy – aren’t NFTs supposed to be unchangeable? Yet more and more concerns that benefit no creator other than the Soonaverse platform.

It's a lot to take in, but it just keeps getting better

>***6.2*** ***Effect of Suspension or Termination.***  *Upon suspension or termination, you acknowledge and agree that SoonLabs shall cease to provide access to a SoonLabs NFT and may delete data associated with your use of SoonLabs NFT.  You are not entitled to compensation of any kind as a result of suspension or termination, regardless of whether effected by you or SoonLabs, and SoonLabs is not liable to you or any third party for such suspension or termination and any related loss.*

This is kind of an expansion on the standard “we have the right to revoke the service at any time for violating our ToS or at our full discretion” (don’t piss these guys off clause) that is present in many ToS. What this means is that if you are suspended or terminated from the platform, as decided by the team, you may lose ALL your NFTs, all records of ever having owned them, and they don’t state what then happens to those NFTs - although I would imagine they go into a Soonaverse pot.

How about we take another look at ownership

>***8.1*** ***Ownership.***  *All right, title and interest in and to the Service including but not limited to copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, trade names, computer code (source and object), titles, avatars, animation, audio-visual effects, sound effects, musical works, look and feel, methods of operation and* ***items built within the Service by users****, are owned by SoonLabs.  SoonLabs reserves all rights in the Service.*

Just in case you weren’t 100% sure they have all the rights and ownership to what you created and build within the Soonaverse, be it an NFT Collection, a DAO, or anything, they have been sure to put it in twice. Just to be sure you clearly understand you have given up everything to their platform and company.

How about the protection of IP and violations? This is of course the biggest issue for creators and should be at the forefront of the support system when building out a creator platform, right…right?

>***8.2*** ***DMCA.***  *SoonLabs responds to notices alleging copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “****DMCA****”).  If you wish to make a DMCA claim, you must provide the following information in writing in your DMCA notice:*   
>  
>*a. identify the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;*  
>  
>*b. identify the material claimed to be infringing and where it is located;*  
>  
>*c. provide reasonably sufficient information to allow SoonLabs to contact you, such as your address, phone number and e-mail address;*  
>  
>*d. provide a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law;*  
>  
>*e. provide a statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner; and*  
>  
>*f. provide an electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.*  
>  
>*SoonLabs may provide you notice if your communication, post, submission or upload was removed as a result of SoonLabs receiving a DMCA notice from a copyright owner.  If you receive notice from SoonLabs, you may provide a counter-notification in writing to SoonLabs’ designated DMCA agent through the means provided below.*  
>  
>*DMCA notices can be sent by filling out an “IP / DMCA Request” on GitHub (https://github.com/soonlabs/soonaverse-dao/issues/new/choose) or by mail:*  
>  
>*SoonLabs NFTs Inc.*  
>  
>*DMCA Notice*  
>  
>*403-134 Abbott Street*  
>  
>*Vancouver, BC, V6B 2K4*

This may seem like a standard DMCA request form, because it is. But the concern here is many.

Firstly, any request for IP removal has to be done off platform, making it a complex and cumbersome task for individual creators or IP owners to make the first step in requesting removal of IP – by which time damage could be done. That is…if you can actually make a request.

Which leads us on to their request form which is to submit to a public GitHub repository. Now I am not sure if they understand privacy laws but forcing users to publish sensitive information to the public domain breaches this in many respects. This immediately prevents IP owners from submitting take down requests and further supports IP infringement over the creator.

Last but not least, they do present a second option to send them a letter. I’m not going to lie I laughed when I saw this, this is hilarious. When time sensitivity is of upmost importance in IP take down (take OpenSea for example, one form and usually a completed takedown within 12-24hrs) – to mail, and then wait for a response, to then reply and then maybe get a result. This is just a tragedy for IP owners and creators.

I hate to say it, but with this evidence at hand it would appear the platform is far from a creator and community friendly project. If anything, it reads as a centralized attempt to gain control over an ecosystem market using traditional web 2.0 tactics of ownership of data and rights, with little regard to the users of the platform. These ToS benefit no one but the SoonLabs team.

Sorry Casters, IOTApunks, She-Weas, Cribs, Moonaco, Magic Voodoo Dolls, IOTA WorldZ, LenDexe, MunkiiLab, IOTarot, IOTAcards, TFT, and the many other hundreds of projects who have unknowingly signed away their IP. One can only hope that the future of the IOTA NFT ecosystem is a little more creator friendly and not so power crazed.

In the video I give you information on both DEXs in terms of features, teams, lanuches and my views.

I know I have a long way to go in terms of production, but hopefully I can provide great information and keep it interesting until the production catches up.

I'd be eternally greatful if the IOTA community could help me get this information out there and increase exposure to IOTA by subscribing and liking the video. However, of course no worries if not.

Credentials can be created by NFT such as diplomas via Proof of Authority by organizations such as universities and governmental agencies. These credentials are then kept inside your DID. One great thing about credentials via NFT is that it will prevent fraudulent credentials. See EBSI, [https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Early+Adopters+Programme](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Early+Adopters+Programme).

Of course, there are many important applications of NFT (DID, real estate, etc), but my favorite is publication. See this article from Nature [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05920-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05920-6).

This cluster which was posted on Twitter by @kowei1995 really made me think about it. It shows that iota followers are in a bubble, seeing the same stuff from the same people all over again with the same sentiment and the same thought. 

I know myself that it is hard to look at other blockchain projects while knowing that iota will (hopefully) outperform all of them but think about the Twitter algorithm. It sees that there are no common topics between crypto twitter guys and iota guys and doesnt recommend anything. 

If we would like, engage, comment etc. On ""average crypto talk, while also mentioning iota here and there, share the developments, nfts and so on, there would be a movement towards the ""crypto twitter continent"" which would push the organic growth and range of tweets regarding iota. 

So IMO it would be good for us to also follow the competitors and engage in constructive talks. 
It will bring us all together and we can reenter the crypto space we forcefully tried to leave the last years.

Daobee will be IOTAs first “free2earn” NFT-creation game! All in-game purchases and NFT-auctions will be done in both IOTA token and Daobees own $BEES currency, leading to continuous revenue streams that naturally grow with the platform.  

**You will be able to participate in these income streams by staking $BEES!**

You can think of $BEES as an in-game currency PLUS.

Not only will $BEES be accepted for in-game features, such as awards, emojis, cosmetics or NFT-auctions. It will also let you take part of Daobee in-game revenue by staking it!

**It works like this:**  

Whenever someone does an in-game purchase or buys an NFT at an NFT-auction, all income gets distributed according to a distribution key.\*      

&#x200B;

**For in-game purchases:**

**62.5% go to all $BEES stakers**

25% go to Daobee

10% go to the airdrop-fund

2.5% get burned      

&#x200B;

**For NFT-auctions:**

50% go to the players who created that NFT

**30% go to all $BEES stakers**

12.5% go to Daobee

5% go to airdrop fund

2.5% get burned      

&#x200B;

The easiest way to get a sizeable chunk of total $BEES supply is by buying Daobee Family NFTs on Soonaverse starting from Monday 9th of May, 16:00 UTC. All owners of Daobee Family NFTs will participate in an initial $BEES airdrop (5% of total supply) and $BEES rolling-airdrop (another 10% of total supply over 2 years).

The more NFTs you own, the higher your share of the airdrop. Collect multiple characters to MULTIPLY you share. Get the GOLDEN DAOBEE NFT (only 100 will exist) on top to triple you share.

The funds from the NFT sale will finance our team to be able to fully concentrate on building Daobee!

Additionally there will be 100 Golden Daobee NFTs, each selling for 999 Mi.

**Since you’ve partnered with TangleSwap, are there plans to list $BEES on the TangleSwap DEX when Shimmer launches?**

Yes   we plan to list $BEES on IOTA DeFi platforms like TangleSwap and   ShimmerSea/TangleSea. We will define all further details of this with   our DeFi partners over the coming months.

**Can you describe which kind of game Daobee will be?**

Daobee   will be a collaborative art creation game, in which the created art   will be sold as NFTs. People will play in fast-paced post-and-vote games   to create funny or beautiful stories, pictures or memes together. The   resulting artwork is sold as an NFT, which will automatically have   utility on Daobee, and 50% of the earnings will go to the players who   created the NFT.

**Will you include multi-chain support**

In   its first iteration Daobee will only support Shimmer and IOTA  networks.  This might be extended to other chains to after initial  release.

**What means EXTRA utility for partnering NFTs in some partner announcements?**

All   NFTs of partnering projects will unlock features on Daobee by adding  to  your personal “Honey-meter”. In the announcements we sometimes wrote   “added”, “extra” or “bonus” utility for these NFTs, however these all   mean the same!

In  the future  some partners will have more extensive partnerships so that  their NFTs  will additionally have exclusive features on Daobee (for  example  exclusive emoji sets).

**Will the NFTs generated by the users be put up for auction on Soonaverse or will you have your own platform?**

The   full Daobee experience will happen directly on Daobee (including NFT   auctions). However we are already in talks with partners that might   enable connecting NFT auctions with their platforms, so that their users   will ALSO be able to bid on NFTs from their website, while others bid   from Daobee. This feature is not confirmed yet though.

**In the event that the NFT doesn’t sell out, what are the plans that the team have for the remaining NFTs?**

The   allocated 15% of all total $BEES will be fully airdropped in case the   NFTs are sold out. If not all NFTs are sold out then less than 15% of   all $BEES will be airdropped accordingly. For example, if 80% of all   Daobee Family NFTs gets sold then 12% of total $BEES will be airdropped   (= 80% of 15%). The remaining $BEES will stay in the Daobee growth and   development fund so that they can be used to finance Daobee  development.

The NFT sale will be open until shortly before the start of the $BEES airdrop (happening later this year).

**People who play Daobee without a connected crypto-wallet, will they be able to receive tokens?**

People   who play without a connected wallet cannot earn while playing. This   will be one of the main mechanism of how Daobee will attract new   audiences into IOTA: Everybody can play for free, but only those who   connect a wallet will be able to earn.

**What type of utility will we receive by holding NFTs from other partners/ecosystem?**

Daobee will be IOTAs first “**Layer-2 NFT utility**”   provider. This means that NFTs of partnering projects will unlock   features on Daobee by adding points to your personal “Honey-meter”! We   already partnered with large parts of the IOTA NFT ecosystem and will   continue to do so with other projects.

You can find all our partners here: [daobee.io](http://www.daobee.io/)

**My   question relates to the TangleSwap NFTs and the unlocking of features   regarding DAOBEE. Seeing as how these NFTs are to be staked within the   DEX ecosystem (in so called “docking stations”) how are these NFTs to  be  used in unlocking features in the DAOBEE ecosystem?**

From   a technical perspective, if you stake your NFTs on the TangleSwap   platform they leave your wallet. This means that Daobee cannot see them   in your wallet anymore and cannot confirm that you own them. We will   however talk to TangleSwap and see if there are workarounds so that   Daobee can still know which NFT belongs to which person in order to   unlock features for them.

**Where can one buy IOTA token?**

The answers depends on in which country you reside in.

I read the arguments in favor and against trying to make up my mind, but I remain mostly unconvinced. I have several issues with it :

\- Gathering a lot of money is certainly good to give away nice incentives, but all I see is that a 20% inflation on SMR supply will be created instantly and for sure for an opaque outcome. How efficiently is that money really going to be employed ? The magical word ""DAO"" doesn't solve it all : decision outcomes from DAOs are mostly steered by a few whales pursuing their own agenda. There's no guarantee there won't be any 'leaks' or that the funds will be allocated wisely.

\- will that even make an impact ? Contrary to raising a certain amount of real dollars from VCs... How will be SMR tokens be valued ? Especially in the current bear market that could well become increasingly bloody ? Iota is valued under 1 B$ right now, so shimmer, iota's testnet, how much will it be valued ? Maybe 100M$ (polkadot/kusama ratio) at best. So we are talking about around 17M$ worth of shimmer, for this fund (compare it to the hundred of millons $ quoted for AVAX, FTM or NEAR). I expect iota and shimmer valuations to increase significantly over time, but for the year ahead, the fund will be squandering ungodly amounts of shimmer because they won't be worth much from start. Once again, who is going to capture like that a large portion of shimmer's market share ?

\- Lastly, what I don't get with this funding proposal, is why do we need it in the first place. Solana, Avalanche, Near... all got massive incentive funds that apparently fueled a lot of development. But these are definitive L1 networks. Not a staging network to upgrade a mainnet like shimmer is supposed to be. As I understood it, there's already a 100M$ fund that has been raised for assembly : shouldn't that contribute to fund dapps that want to launch on the broad iota ecosystem ? And what about the unclaimed Iota's that could be voted for Buidl in a treasury fund ?

As a iota holder, I'm not aiming at shimmer's growth for its own sake, I want shimmer's success to fuel iota's. So to recap, how do I view funding for projects on shimmer : 

\- the end goal should be a release of said project on iota. Releasing an early version on shimmer should be seen as a natural step before launching on iota mainnet and not an end on itself. So if the project enventually aims at releasing something on iota, it can naturally tap its funding from iota's buidl treasury (that I will vote in favour) or assembly's funding fund. If the project uses smart contracts, it will most probably run on assembly, so that makes perfect sense.

\- if it needs additional funding, it can procede as many other great projects did : look at soonlabs, lendexe, tangleswap, tanglelabs, tangle pay, etc... They all launched successful NFT sales because they proved by their work and engagement that they were worthy projects to bet on, building essential dapps for the ecosystems. I don't see why the community would not seed fund other promising projects. And for the infrastructure projects, the common goods that serve the whole ecosystem and don't have any return on investment by themselves, once again, that's what assembly's and iota's buidling funds are for.","self","https://redd.it/uv7aev"

I tried to migrate my old IOTA account on my Ledger Nano X, following the migration video and also using the Firefly V1.2 wallet on Windows 11 which seems to be mandatory to be able to do the migration (users say V1.3 doesn't work for the migration).

Doing this, after the creation of the addresses with the old IOTA Legacy Ledger app, it writes ""Finding balances"" and then the error message 'Try checking again. If you still can't find your balance you might have selected the wrong account index'.

It displays an amount of 0 Mi on the same page, whereas I know there were a certain amount.

There has been so much talk about what it takes to run a node. The hardware requirements, the electricity costs...

Some have had the idea of ​​just adding them natively to the router, which is also a legitimate suggestion.

But a crypto cell phone is as simple as it is ingenious.

1. Most have very strong hardware.

2. We always have it with us anyway.

3. It's almost always on.

4. We use it every day.

It fulfills almost every requirement to keep a decentralized system (Web3) alive.

So it is almost obvious to operate a cell phone as a node. Or in the case of IOTA, maybe even launching an “IOTA cell phone” itself.

Sure there are some infos on twitter or on github but nothing official and readable for non IT persons. It does not have to be long, just a quick update. How does reorg work? Is inclusion score already implemented? Are snapshots at least theoretically solved? Just stuff like that

**Preface:** 

**General news about IOTA:**

IOTA foundation gets restructured and split into several entities. IOTA Foundation itself will focus on core IOTA technology (Stardust, Assembly, IOTA 2.0 etc.). For-profit spin-offs will focus on product development and adoption. Ecosystem partners will do so too.

Ecosystem growth will be done by new EDF (swiss association, finished end of July, will have much more freedom in spending money)

**Shimmer:** 

Open Beta will start in July – After that several week of extensive public testing

60 projects plan to launch on Shimmer, 10-20 more in talks       

&#x200B;

**Start of AMA**

**Q 1: Which staff/areas are effected by the re-organization of IF**

\- Important differentiation between IOTA “core” technology and product development and market-adoption

\- Shimmer, Assembly, IOTA 2.0 and few adoption projects (like EBSI) stay at IF

\- Other technology and adoption outsourced to for-profit spin-off companies and ecosystem partners       

&#x200B;

**Q2: Who leads the different organizations?**

\- Mostly established people from the current IF will lead these spin-offs        

&#x200B;

**Q3: Will you be able to do marketing after the restructuring?**

\- Yes, with the upcoming Swiss foundation this will be possible        

&#x200B;

**Q4: What do you have in mind for marketing?**

\- No simple sponsoring soccer/F1 (burns a lot of money for non-sustainable effects)

\- Instead: Marketing focused on developers for example with developer education events and hackathons         

&#x200B;

**Q5: How close is Shimmer release**

\- Open beta coming in July, after that some weeks of testing before full release         

&#x200B;

**Q6: Are you satisfied with Coordicide solution? What is still missing?**

Dom: ""We´re 90% there”

Last points to be ironed out:

\- Congestion control/aMana currently discussed (see Hans Moogs recent blogpost). Answers expected in a couple of weeks based on tests and simulations.

\- Incentives to use protocol need to be defined (Maybe inflation to reward participation and honest behavior)

\- Community will be involved in these discussions  


**Q7: How is EBSI going?**

\- Yesterday a presentation was held to EBSI board and hundreds of pages of documents with full solution for their usecase have been submitted

\- Feedback by European Commission expected by September

&#x200B;

**Q8: What is still missing for Shimmer full release?**

\- Documentation and tooling for developers

\- Firefly support (currently Shimmer-Firefly is in alpha)

\- Smart contracts need to be finalized (including EVM support)

\- Lots of public testing        

&#x200B;

**Q9: What is the IOTA foundations mission? Many recent changes in strategy make the vision very unclear.**

The vision still the same: 

1. Building a DLT that is superior to blockchain (Prove that parallelized DAGs are better than linear Blockchains)

2. Drive adoption of the public IOTA mainnet. First focus on crypto adoption, real-world adoption long-term

Dom: “We´re here to win. Nothing short of that.”

&#x200B;

**Q10: What was Hans recent blogpost about?**

\- Hans wrote about congestion control in the IOTA 2.0 network

\- His idea is to let nodes earn aMana by holding IOTA and then use this Mana (burn it) for transactions and possibly even layer 1 smart contract computations

\- Hans idea similar to Vitalik Buterins idea of “soulbound tokens”, tokens bound to DID of node

\- Gets analyzed and tested currently

&#x200B;

**Q11: State of Assembly? Is it only an idea? What is missing for implementation**

\- Shimmer EVM is in fact already a beta-version for Assembly (“proof-of-authority chain”) and near completion

\- Later: Fully decentralize Assembly. Ongoing discussions about architecture, for example if Optimistic roll-ups or Zero-knowledge proofs should be used to roll-up smart contracts) More details on that after summer.

&#x200B;

**Q12: How will spinning of Firefly into its own entity apart from IOTA Foundation influence token-voting, Governance protocols etc?**

\- Everybody will be able to publish their proposal on the Tangle. This will no longer depend on Firefly or any other individual wallet anymore (wallets will only be used to display and interact with proposals. The proposals itself will reside directly on the Tangle)

&#x200B;

**Q13: Is IOTA moving away from focusing on adoption?**

\- Partly true: The IOTA Foundation will not focus on adoption anymore and instead focus purely on tech 

\- For-profit spin-off companies and ecosystem partners will care for adoption

\- First focus will lie on crypto-adoption (i.e. DeFi, NFTs, etc).

&#x200B;

**Q14: What is the status of IOTA Foundation finances?**

Finances got hit by bearmarket, cause main treasury holds mostly IOTA tokens.

\- IF will have shares in all for-profit spin-offs and therefore might earn with them.

&#x200B;

**Q15: Status on standardization efforts?**

\- Standardization got completely deprioritized until protocol and tech is much more defined and implemented        

&#x200B;

**Q16: How is the bear market influencing the IOTA Foundation?**

\- It is easier to focus on long-term building in a bear-market. Less pressure to chase short-term hypes.

\- Financial runway based on the treasury is much shorter though

\- However, no delays in tech are expected cause researchers are well financed for now.        

&#x200B;

**Q17: How will the new EU (MICA) regulations affect IOTA ecosystem?**

\- New EU regulations introduce much stricter anti-money laundering rules (IF will for example be framed as an “issuer”) 

\- Changes do not affect IOTA technology per se

\- It is expected that the entry barrier into crypto will be higher

\- But clear regulations are positive for adoption and political acceptance

\- Overall more positives than negatives

\- Dom forsees that ehere will be “anonymous side of crypto” and “regulated side of crypto”. IOTA wants to take part in both.

\- IOTA Foundation will increased lobbying efforts in Bruxels

**Next AMA will happen in August!**

I'd like to see a official social media account by the IOTA foundation in the fediverse. Especially for users who like to have more privacy and therefore use alternatives like Mastodon, etc. an account in the fediverse would be awesome! Especially because of the possibility to use bridges, so that posts from Mastodon will automatically be posted on Twitter.

The fediverse and especially Mastodon is getting more and more users in the past months and official accounts will also help the fediverse, because it makes it more interesting. Because of it's decentralization you could either use an existing server that allows accounts from companies, etc. or even set up your own server for official accounts related to IOTA, which is pretty straightforward with Mastodon.

This tight result made me realize that to my knowledge, there has not been any relevant discussion about minimal aproval thresholds for the votes. The only official statement I found was that 50% + 1 vote is enough to pass a proposal and this was buried in a lenghty post about the technicalities of how voting on iota works.

Wouldn't it make sense to have different thresholds depending on the impact of the proposals : like 66% or even 75% for significant changes vs 50% for more mundane issues ? That would mimic what we know in our democracies (constitutional changes vs common laws) and would make sense to preserve a feeling that a true majority supports the most significant changes in the protocol.

Changing the supply of a coin is quite a big change on the very touchy issue of monetary policy (especially on these times of uncontrolled money printing by our central banks). Passing such a proposal when the iota community is almost split 50-50 feels quite wrong and that will undoubtly weight for quite some time on its unity...

This whole thing has been really poorly planned and I expect the usual fuders to weaponize it against iota. We really didn't need that drama.

So at least let it be a lesson to initiate a discussion on future voting rules.","self","https://redd.it/w9blsk"

Is it as easy to judge Iota decentralization by node count or are there other factors to consider?

This seems low compared to Ethereum or even Solana, however I'm not sure if this is a meaningful or complete metric by which to judge.

I understand a main measure of decentralization for POW blockchains is total hash rate and how many entities it is divided amongst (miner count) and for POS blockchains the staked coins as percentage of circulating supply and how many entities the staked coins are divided amongst.  Unclear to me how to make similar measurements for Iota since it doesn't seem to fit nicely into either of those buckets.

I read on Twitter that over 1250 different tokens had been minted the first 24 hours. I guess this is cool and all, but what do the creaters of these tokens do with them? I assume the majority of them are just created for fun with no real use case?

This brings me over to my second question: what will happen with all these tokens once the wallet move on from beta? Will all these coins follow along and forever be a token to be traded on the Shimmer Network or are these tokens just temporary play-tokens for the beta network?

**Moonaco Podcast 32: In this episode, Thomas was joined by Vitaly from the GAT Network.**  


GAT Network is a multichain toolbox for NFTs that was launched on the Binance Smart Chain in May 2021. GAT is not a single on-chain project, but rather a **set of connected on-chain projects focused on NFTs, Trading and Gaming**. 

It all started back in 2020 with the idea of a NFT game. The first game they launched was a **Play-to-Earn game named “Alchemy Toys”**. Players can collect NFTs that function as playing cards and combine them to create new cards of a higher value. They also have the opportunity to burn their whole collection and receive a share of the treasury. 

But there was one problem: no marketplace on the BSC provided the features that were needed for the game. So, the team of GAT Network decided to develop their own marketplace: MintedVodka. **MintedVodka is a multi-chain marketplace** that has several unique features like flexible trading and layer minting. The platform also gives indie game developers the possibility to participate in the NFT market, just as digital artists do right now by offering Game Minting and Software Minting. Never heard of Software Minting? Instead of a digital picture, the NFT you mint contains a software package that you can download and use as long as you own the NFT.

So, **what has this to do with IOTA**? Roman Semko and Vitaly, two of the founding members of GAT Network, originally come from the IOTA ecosystem. In 2017 Roman helped to develop some of the node software for IOTA. As soon as IOTA announced that Smart Contracts would soon be available on the assembly, there was only one logic consequence for the team: **come back home and build on IOTA**. Currently GAT Network is working on the second version of MintedVodka which will then be released on Shimmer and Assembly. The goal is to become the place to be for NFT projects and creators on the Assembly network.","self","https://redd.it/wrehax"

You'll be able to claim your Shimmer staking rewards through the new Firefly Shimmer app. It is a desktop application that installs separately from your main Firefly Desktop installation.  

We are still awaiting a review and security audit from Ledger before the Ledger Shimmer app is available in production on Ledger Live. Their review is scheduled within the 2 weeks following Shimmer launch. If you are a Ledger user and you don't want to wait, it will still be possible to claim your Shimmer rewards. In Ledger Live Settings, you simply go to ""Experimental features"" and enable ""Developer mode"", allowing you to install the Shimmer app on your device.  

When Shimmer launches, Firefly Shimmer will be available to download from the Firefly website and a full token claiming guide will be published. It's a very simple process and we're looking forward to seeing everyone claiming their Shimmer tokens and trying out the new app ❤️","self","https://redd.it/xm0ujd"

I have 3 wallets in my Firefly wallet (desktop.) I see funds correctly  inclueding assembly and shimmer.

Then I have my mobile wallet thats unable to show correct assembly balance when cheking wallet 1. Other wallets are showing correctly. Lets say that mobile wallet shows  around 10% assembly compared to the desktop and it makes me worried.

Now I redeemed shimmer tokens. I got all my shimmers from wallet 2 & 3, but I did not receive any from wallet 1. Even though in desktop application I clearly see that I have a lot of shimmer in that wallet.

I have tried playing with around with different nodes on my mobile wallet. I have also now been pressing search funds for couple of hours in my Shimmer firefly wallet. No success.

Missed out most of the staking rounds after I didn't realise I had to re-stake after the first one. So I'm looking now into whether its worth buying what I lost of Shimmer through the staking. 

But to do this, I was hoping someone could explain, what actually is the purpose of Shimmer and its token? I believe, although I may be wrong, that shimmer is the staging network for IOTA. 

So, when IOTA 2.0 is put on shimmer and is successful (I hope), I assume it will then go to the main IOTA network. Thus, I may as-well just buy some more MIOTA, rather than shimmer. 

Or will shimmer run along side IOTA, like a second layer system? Such as Polygon is to ETH. 

If someone could also explain what the purpose of the Assembly network is also, that would be great.

Of course with cheaper hardware and set up it would be less problematic but it is still a hurdle. Therefore, I wanted to see if they were any changes in the protocol that would make people change. Would it be possible or even a good idea to have reduced weight in consensus (and mana) for nodes running on the same providers by filtering by IP address ?  

For exemple if there are only 10 nodes each staking 10% of IOTA supply but 5 of them are running on AWS while the rest are running on their own server, you would divide the amount of tokens taken into account for consensus for nodes on AWS by 5. If you do a quick calculation you get that AWS nodes have 1/30 chance of being in charge of consensus whereas the rest of the nodes would be at 1/6. The mana distribution would be calculated the same way. Right now it would be 1/10 for every nodes in this scenario.  

I am aware that people would be using VPNs to circonvent these limitations but it's still additional cost and if they all use the same VPNs providers their consensus weight would still be slashed if they use the IPs from the same provider.","self","https://redd.it/z1or0v"

It was great to see a preview of the Shimmer Firefly wallet. Not only will it host NFTs but it will have new and better governance integrations and UI. This will allow for true Community DAO governance and particularly, the ability to manage a Community Treasury.   


Now that the Shimmer Treasury Committee application process have moved to Phase II, it's time to chose a Program Lead and Reviewers.  


I JD Sutton (DeepSea) have applied for the program lead position. For anyone that has attended the governance meetings they know I always put the community consensus first, as well, I make transparency and efficiency a priority when developing processes. It is always my concern to have the community come first within our governance structure.  


Not only do I have the career experience to lead a community treasury, but I have Doxx'ed myself and am completely transparent about who I am. I don't hide who I am from the community. ***I want to practice what I preach!*** It's not just about having a transparent treasury but it is also about having a transparent leader that acts as a representative of the community him or herself.  


Our treasury is not huge compared to others in the crypto ecosystem. It is crucial that we choose our program lead wisely. Given the size of the Treasury we don't have much to make mistakes with and must ensure we are efficient to build an everlasting fund. Ensure you choose a leader that doesn't just preach transparency and risk management, but also lives and practices them as well.

I read an article that IOTA is in "" money saving mode"". The coin dont perform well and the reservers are not that great, around 10 Millionen €. Which is of course a lot of money but not for a company that size.

The economy is not in a good spot and crypto did nearly everything to have a bad reputation. The technologie didnt developed as everybody promised and everybody expected. Not only is the trust gone from the people but also the trust from companys which equals no more funds.

In summary this means there will be a rough time now. The ""good"" years are over for now and I currently dont see any future. They need some time to finish the their ""all mighty"" product and without money it will be impossible. Also if it is possible there has to be an adaptation, I dont understand the whole system good enough to see all benefits but currently I dont see many.

Anyway my question is, will IOTA survive? I know for a fact that IOTA loves to be instransparent with their money and intern communication. I have a friend who took part in every meeting and everything around it. Without him, I wouldnt understand a single word what they do because their communication is all over the place some on twitter some discord some on interviews.

Im curious to hear your view.

The raising of the Shimmer token supply was a great illustration of the power community voting has, and the dispersal of these tokens, 10% of the supply to the Tangle Ecosystem Association (TEA) and 10% to the community DAO fund, was clearly publicised and voted upon.

Yet now, still without a community DAO formed, still without Smart Contracts, and still without 100% on chain voting, another proposal has been presented that is attempting a move to strip the community DAO of 50% of the community treasury fund and place them in control of the TEA - in what some may say is a swayed pseudo governance move. 

You may not have heard about this vote - unlike the previous community votes, there has been no blog, no public announcements, just some quietly publicised posts in the favourable IF Discord and with only 132 people currently voting on the outcome, does the overall community even get a say?

&#x200B;

[Original Proposal Vote Outcome after 7 days - ONLY 132 VOTES!](https://preview.redd.it/o66rm4bds07a1.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=f30518a76024b59b33f8b44dbf9c068e1586c73f)

# So what is the proposal all about?

The proposal is built upon the need to rush into action and use up all the funds as quick as possible. There is a lot of FOMO speech about this is the end, the time to act is now, if we don’t, we will fail. It presents an IOTA Foundation swayed committee that will specifically assess IOTA Foundation proposals on the allocation of funds, and decide the allocation of these funds, under NDA, with zero guidelines for transparency or accountability to the community. Anyone who has been in business or has signed an NDA understands that transparency is easily maintained, despite NDAs being in place.

&#x200B;

>*More interesting to discover is that this proposal has been put forward, not by the community, but by IOTA Foundation director and leader of the board Dominik Schiener - this is after Dom had previously stated that the IF would never look to use or control the Community DAO treasury.*

&#x200B;

**With the TEA already receiving 10% of the Shimmer supply, it begs to question, why do they now require half of the community treasury on top of this already community voted on windfall?**

Dom recently revealed the IF financial status, again in Discord, that raised a few eyebrows.   


[The current financial status of the IOTA Foundation](https://preview.redd.it/g07z8eyws07a1.png?width=358&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e4316d1e435ef301d81d0cae6bdb65d90501b1)

There’s no secret the IF are selling their entire IOTA holdings, to fund operations for the foreseeable future, but an interesting note to observe in his release of the IF balance is that 30% of the Shimmer tokens dispersed to the TEA has already been allocated. With the current market downtrend, this has resulted in the TEA burning through these in just two months and leaving the TEA with less money to throw about than they had hoped. If the Shimmer supply the TEA has been issued is being used up at such a pace, then it is apparent the current supply the TEA holds doesn’t support its original plans, despite the IF saying that they are okay with operations and their plans for the Shimmer launch.

# It is here that we arrive at the current turn of events...

>Despite saying the IF would never attempt to use or control the community DAO funds, the first act in community governance, even before the community has had a chance to establish a DAO entity and even before Smart Contracts and secure on-chain voting arrive, Dominik Schiener founder of the IF has put it upon himself to go against all previous community votes and use his influence to transfer control of 50% of the entire community treasury to under the TEA’s control, for use over the next 12 months. 

# This would leave the community treasury with just 35% of it’s entire allocation by the end of the first 12 months.

You can read Dom’s original proposal [here](https://govern.iota.org/t/sgp-0003-shimmer-growth-committee-as-part-of-the-tangle-ecosystem-association/1552) – as you will see, this proposal only had 132 votes because it was primarily presented in the Discord - which is but a small portion of the IOTA and Shimmer communities, so the lack of exposure presented an extremely small voting turn out, the majority of which are devout supporters of Dom.

Interestingly enough though, during the past week the community presented a counter-proposal to this original one - which can be viewed [here](https://govern.iota.org/t/counter-proposal-sgp-0003-shimmer-growth-committee-as-part-of-the-tangle-ecosystem-association/1557). Even though the premise of the original proposal by Dom is dubious, **the community counter proposal continued by endorsing Dom’s original yet provided a more “community friendly” approach** and resulted in a similar voting turn out in half the amount of time, with very different results.

 

[The results of the counter-proposal vote after 3 days](https://preview.redd.it/xfnnyqx0u07a1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf99a79588fe8dc0342e40e0aac6105f66c8c0a8)

# The main points of observation are as follows:

**The funding allocation is to be lowered to 35% of the community funds over the original 50%.** 

>This would leave the community DAO with at least 50% of their token supply by the end of the first year, allowing the DAO to establish order and a financial model that can carry it into the future. This also doesn’t affect the proposal in any way as is pointed out by the fact the community can always vote to allocate further funds to the committee if it operates in the community’s best interests over the first 6 months. It not only provides financial security for the DAO but also the flexibility of evaluating the value of the Shimmer Growth Committee over its first six months. 

**Change the committee to four community representatives and one IOTA Foundation representative, as opposed to the three community representatives and two IOTA Foundation representatives in the original proposal.** 

>This is simply logical – every vote needs a majority, and naturally all IF members will vote yes on every IF proposal creating a stacked voting system from day one. Having a community committee of just three means even if two of the three community vote a majority against a proposal, it will still be carried through because IF dominates. With a 4 to 1, it would require at least 50% of the community’s representatives to agree for it to pass.

**Add transparency guidelines.** 

>One clear omission from the original proposal is that there are no clear guidelines for transparency and accountability, yet a lot of bluster about NDAs and how “we can’t tell the community everything”. NDAs are all good and well, they protect business interests and trade secrets, and a whole lot of other sensitive exposure. What is important to understand though, is this does not in any way prevent transparency. As the counter proposal outlines, transparency of the allocation of treasury funds and their use is simple to share with the community, without releasing sensitive information pertaining to NDAs.

One other interesting note to make is there is actually another clause that has not been heavily discussed but definitely an important one. That the IOTA Foundation or the Tangle Ecosystem Association will not attempt to use or apply for the use of the funds. In Dom’s original proposal there is no mention of this direct use of the funds for the IF or TEAs benefit or interests, but this also protects the funds from being used for operations or business requirements – there should be no need for this if the IF have the amount of money Dom previously disclosed.

[The clause for preventing the IF or TEA directly making use of the community funds.](https://preview.redd.it/wwh4m9bbu07a1.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc539f6678e279a3aa08e19ac989dee53b2f0543)

Overall, these additional changes provide a certainly more community friendly approach and it is good to see that the community is engaging in governance discussion and counterproposals that may provide a more sustainable future for the DOA treasury fund whilst still supporting ambiguous initiatives that may not serve the community’s interests over those of the foundation.

&#x200B;

[The main alterations to Dom's original proposal as presented by the community counter proposal.](https://preview.redd.it/w22zm1kfu07a1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=eccf4eea8ef87e7e1e7eec8e67bab6a68677cc34)

# But how was it received?

**Instead of supporting open community governance and the discussion surrounding the proposal, a direct attack on the author of the counter proposal illustrated that Dom had zero interest in engaging in the discussion.** 

&#x200B;

[Dom, instead of entering into the discussion, poses simple personal attacks on the author, denouncing community involvement in the discussions and decisions  ](https://preview.redd.it/0bmzm0jtu07a1.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=626101b78c2f98149bf5498c649967b950f19d6b)

Vilifying the author within the community in an attempt to discredit the application and outright refusing to discuss a single point on the topic, but continually attacking the opposition of his original plan. Dom shared he had no intentions of actually engaging in community led governance.

&#x200B;

[Despite a community member actually stepping up and doing something about the proposal, it was clearly dismissed by Dom, who continued to refuse to actually discuss the proposal at all.](https://preview.redd.it/6rnrzs8pv07a1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd333d38f2d213a2ab6df789c3d9f6ae42770e9f)

It is a shame that this is the response individuals can expect when entering alternative proposals and objective opinions. This will, in no doubt, result in less people wanting to get involved and have their say for fear of pariahism in the community.

# The important thing about community governance is that the community has a voice. 

**Objective opinions are discussed and a fair voting outcome is achieved.** 

Why then, at the first opportunity for the community to enter an alternative, is this so heavily shot down? This sort of rhetoric is common in politics, the use of defamation to turn voters against the opposition, but it can also say a lot about the instigator. 

*Why did Dom feel the need just go for the kill, instead of enter into discussion surrounding the proposal?*

&#x200B;

>From an outsider perspective, irrelevant of the author, the counter-proposal holds a lot of merit and actually makes sense. It provides a foundation for the future of the community DAO and demonstrates caution in allocating too much to an initiative in the early stages of the governance. It also favours the community voice, rather than having an IF dominant committee. 

But with such outburst from professionals leading the Foundation, it begs the question:

# Does community voice even matter?

&#x200B;

I am currently finishing my MSC thesis on “Designing a policy recommendation for blockchain to transition towards a quantum-safe environment”, and I have conducted most of the research and I am now at the stage where I will start interviewing people in the field to get their views on this topic. As I am doing it together with Deloitte, I already have 17 in-house experts that are willing to be interviewed, and from my own ‘personal’ connections, I have managed to find 14 others in the blockchain space with relevant expertise. From my research I found that IOTA has recently moved away from post-quantum cryptography. I would love to schedule an online session (30 min. to 1 hour) sometime in the middle of January with a lead-developer or cryptography expert at IOTA to discuss their views on post-quantum cryptography and the barriers of implementation, along with certain drivers for change and potential limitations. 

I would really appreciate it if we could set this meeting up, so if you are someone that is willing to conduct this interview or know anyone in IOTA that would be open to this, please help me out!!

network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular XMRTO and MorphToken These services are only recommendations and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project Be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I generate a Ledger Monero Wallet with the GUI or CLI This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Check this page for the GUI instructions and this page for the CLI instructions 4 Wallet

Monero NG This is the text of an issue that I posted yesterday to the Monero GitHub here It describes mostly technical dev matters but should be of general interest as well Also reposted here for additional visibility No Wallet Left Behind Make Sure Our Wallets Survive the Fork to Monero NG The Short Version If things proceed as currently planned Monero will maybe sometime in 2023 or 2024 hardfork to a secondgeneration protocol called Seraphis and a new addressing scheme called Jamtis These changes are so extensive that you could very well call the resulting cryptocurrency Monero New Generation or Monero NG for short Monero wallets of all types desktop smartphone web will need larger functional UI changes to fully support this The even bigger problem for wallets however as I see it The Monero core software will probably offer a quite different programming interface API that Monero wallets must use in order to continue to function And this in turn will require an extensive refactoring of the code of the wallets regardless of the programming language used and the OS they run on This is difficult expensive and can take a lot of time Personally I see a real danger that at least some important and widely used Monero wallets wont be ready for the hardfork and that we might even loose wallets because the challenge will be too great for their authors and they will be forced to discontinue their apps I propose to start a dedicated effort to prevent such a very unfortunate outcome by working out a clear and welldocumented migration path for wallets towards Seraphis and Jamtis and start this effort not with the hardfork already looming at the horizon mere months away but right now This effort will probably be as much about project management as it will be about technology and programming interfaces Background Work is well under way to implement something you could call a secondgeneration protocol for Monero called Seraphis You can find details on the author UkoeHB s GitHub here In parallel tevador designs a new addressing and wallet tiers scheme to be used with Seraphis called Jamtis that is currently documented and discussed here The changes compared with the current Monero protocol and addressing scheme will be extensive Better privacy through much larger rings with a quite different structure of transactions as recorded in the blockchain migration to new address formats every wallet will get new addresses wallet types going far beyond merely 2 wallet types full and viewonly seed format 16 words instead of 25 and more In a recent IRC chat UkoeHB called this halfjokingly Monero 20 which personally I find spoton I just avoided the potentially confusing 20 version number in the post title and called it NG for New Generation to make clear the magnitude of the changes As I see it Seraphis and Jamtis bring Monero forward enormously but at the same time their introduction is a monumental endeavor in every respect and not only technically difficult but also a formidable project management challenge for a team of opensource devs as large and as diverse as Moneros If we stay on this course I would roughly estimate that the hardfork to Seraphis and Jamtis could take place in 2023 or 2024 Moneros Wallet API There is a large and complicated C class named Wallet2 that is an integral part of the Monero core code base You find its header file here You could say that this class is the center of the universe they revolve around as far as most Monero consumer wallet apps are concerned Internally the typical wallet app ends up calling methods of this class extensively to manage Monero wallets either directly or through some thin layer like walleth that the GUI wallet uses source is here If you look at this class as Moneros wallet handling API as far as I know this interface has stayed remarkably stable since Moneros birth in 2014 It has certainly grown with the introduction of multisig RingCT subaddresses and other things but was probably never fully overturned a fortunate fact for Monero wallet apps because they could count on a solid fundament over many years The Problem During the alreadymentioned chat about Seraphis and Jamtis wallets on IRC the following problem suddenly dawned on me It will probably not be possible in a sensible way to merely somewhat extend wallet2h as an API once more to accomodate Seraphis and Jamtis Right now the functional changes seem simply too great to me for that and IMHO this class is not particularly well designed to serve as such an important API in the first place and it has a quite low level of abstraction which makes it vulnerable to any larger functional changes Anyway while the header file might still look quite reasonable wallet2cpp is a gigantic complicated mass of C code its over 14000 LOCs are here that cries out for refactoring for years already but so far no Monero dev really dared to take on the challenge because of the amount of work involved and the very central role of the class for the whole Monero software universe already described Somehow stuffing Seraphis wallet handling and Jamtis address management into wallet2 would probably be sheer madness from an engineering point of view and UkoeHB has rightfully so IMHO already made clear that he has no intention whatsoever to even try If you followed me so far maybe you start to see the same problem I see If this API falls away and gets replaced by something new and considerably different the very fundament most Monero wallet apps rely on will get pulled out from under their feet This will require large and timeconsuming changes in their codebase And this in turn will lead to a serious project management problem How can we make it possible for wallet app authors to start early enough with adapting their code to be ready for the hardfork to Seraphis and Jamtis in time If we are not careful here we might end up with a situation where on the day of the hardfork only the CLI wallet is fully functional the GUI wallet is still on its way and its unclear when smartphone wallets like Monerujo and Cake Wallet will be functional again thanks to updates Or the other way round we might have to postpone the hardfork many months maybe even more than once despite everything being ready in the core software already Proposal I propose to work out a clear and welldocumented migration path for Monero wallet apps towards Seraphis and Jamtis and start with this work more or less immediately How could that path look In a very first round of brainstorming I had the following idea that may be worth discussing further after starting a corresponding project Maybe its possible to define a new API lets call it wallet3 as a working title that is abstract and flexible enough to be suitable for Seraphis and Jamtis on the one hand but on the other hand can be used to handle current Monero wallets as well In this scenario the first implementation of wallet3 would be a reasonably thin layer above wallet2 with that former class still doing almost all the heavy lifting Advantage With this API available eg at the end of this year 2022 wallet app authors could already start migrating during 2023 and then switch to it well ahead of the Seraphis and Jamtis hardfork The final switch to the new technologies would be relatively simple and could avoid painful deadline troubles Another thought that crossed my mind was deprecating any direct binary interfaces outright and starting to fully rely on RPC There is already now an almost fully featurecomplete RPC wallet interface the header file describing it is here and I think this interface has a much better chance of getting successfully extended to accomodate Seraphis and Jamtis than wallet2h What I dont know however right now is how difficult it is to put smartphone wallets on such an RPCbased fundament Its worth to mention here that Monero dev woodser has defined a new and clean wallet API quite a while ago already and implemented it in C Java and JavaScript The design is documented here its C implementation is here Its only for the current Monero technology of course but maybe it could serve as a good starting point for wallet3 UkoeHB is currently working on a proofofconcept implementation of a Seraphis wallet As far as I understand it will have a fresh structure and interface designed from the ground up for Seraphis It may be a good idea to wait for the publication of that work before starting to define something like wallet3 but the whole migration project could probably start already before that which an attempt to find consensus about the general strategy Requirements for Success To sucessfully pull off a Monero wallet migration project like I decribe it here two things are crucial in my opinion People are needed to work on it preferably people with knowledge already about the architecture and structure of the Monero codebase and ideally some experience in API design plus project management on top of it But secondly the Monero dev community and the broader Monero ecosystem must come to stand behind the workedout strategy and support it as the agreed way forward Wallet app authors must come around to trust it enough to bank the future of their apps on the resulting migration strategy and API based on at least a loose consensus that its solid and suitable Regardless of quality its quite easy to ignore to death something like that and turn it into a failure Build it and nobody comes for many possible reasons because of I dont care enough because of Nobody ever asked me because of Not Invented Here because of I can do better or even I just dont like the people in this workgroup Of course I am well aware that you cant force anything here acceptance must come as a natural consequence of the quality of the work and the trust earned by the devs involved

walletWeb How long does it take for my balance to unlock Your balance is unlocked after 10 confirmations which means 10 mined blocks A block is mined approximately every two minutes on the Monero network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular XMRTO and MorphToken These services are only recommendations and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project Be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I

network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular XMRTO and MorphToken These services are only recommendations and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project Be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular XMRTO and MorphToken These services are only recommendations and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project Be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I

Vs Bitcoin Source Code Analyses How Decentralized are we Recently I got interested in tracking the progress of blockchains like Bitcoin and Monero With open source blockchains it is possible to track the development of the project merely by looking at its source code Let us put our boots on the ground and mess with some real data I am a Patreon member of gkaykck and received the info via gitbeatinfo The analysis is done on github repos extracting very useful metrics to further study analyze growth and shortcomings of a blockchain In my opinion the data presented must be taken very seriously for sustained growth of a blockchain such as Monero Metrics chosen Team retention This metric shows how many contributors involved with source code modification are still active It is usually an indicator of how healthy the team is Values very close to 0 essentially means a dead project while 100 would mean its a young project Its not uncommon to see this value below 10 on healthy but old projects Knowledge retention Knowledge retention is a measure of how many lines of code that were edited by a certain contributor and if that contributor is still onboard This metric is even more relevant than team retention because not all developers contribute equally Its usually a bad sign to see sudden drops as some teams recover from senior developer losses while others dont Refactoring rate A refactoring rate of 50 means half of its code base is rewritten 60 refactoring rate is what we can assume to be generally good But lower numbers would probably mean that projects are adding features faster than maintaining legacy code Versions Chart Here on this chart you can browse how many lines of code modified since given start date The modifications are put under 4 different class additions deletions modifications and renamed The analysis has been done for full 3 years between 2019 to 2022 for both Monero and Bitcoin To cut out noise commits ranging from 100 to 1000 lines are considered If a developer did not contribute for more than 90 days during this period they are filtered out from the data set I will leave it to the users to decode the data further should they wish to Monero From the executive summary we see in the last 3 years only 337 of the contributors are still onboard and the new onboarded contributors only contributed 337 of the total changes Also refactoring rate has been found poor indicating legacy code exists and pace of features have outpaced improvement of existing code base The number of unique contributors are 29 however only 46 are major contributors not a healthy sign to a decentralized project This could also be due to complexity of Monero source code and only hardcore experts understand and implement it or lack of documentation thereof x200B There was a good amount of activity until mid 2020 however the frequency of updates have reduced since This could also be due to lack of resources for merging pull requests on github x200B Top 10 contributors in the past 3 years x200B The number of new people onboarded or who have continued to stay has been less than in previous years This could become a point of contention in future for a decentralized project x200B The knowledge base is clearly C And the most edited files have been listed to the left Bitcoin Bitcoin is an older project now completing 13 years The team and knowledge retention have reduced over the years with only 1337 old developers retention Refactoring rate has been superb at 5037 which indicates maintenance of codebase is given equal importance to new features being developed x200B Version history shows new features maintenance documentation and pullrequests are being adhered to at an active pace throughout What the data shows for Monero community Please note the data itself is derived from a 3rd party analysis tool see this post from CC reddit and comments for more details I am merely presenting my analysis based on the data derived It may not be entirely accurate as it is still under development 1 Source code contribution Monero blockchain is decentralized but concerns may grow about its centralization of development in future We need to contribution from more members in Github in spite of the complexity it offers Blockchain is only as decentralized as its source code is 2 Reliance Are we merely relying for 45 core developers with hardcore knowledge for a 4 Billion worth of Cryptocurrency What if those experts just decide to leave tonight for personal reasons Is it not a threat to Monero blockchain itself 3 Maintenance Vs Development Equal focus could be placed to maintain legacy code as well as develop new features for Monero Maintenance of codebase and clearing it out must be given equal importance to adding new features over time 4 Lack of Documentation The lack of overall documentation one stop shop is lacking for Monero It is scattered all around An idea is CCS proposal to create such documentation so that anyone coherent with C development there are millions in the world and interested to learn more about Monero could be onboarded with ease This is just not the case right now 5 Delay in merging pullrequests There are many pullrequests in Monero and I understand it needs careful consideration Some pull requests takes months before they have a comment in it or are merged For eg there are some committers like mjxmr who have 20 pull requests open not sure why they are not merged yet This could be due to lack of resources and this could be concerning and draining for people who actively want to contribute 6 Only a handful people decide what goes in Why do we have only a 23 developers merging pullrequest code on Github Can this be improved by voting weight for a given pullrequest Only when we come up with clever out of the box solutions can Monero source remain as decentralized as the blockchain itself I love Monero project What can we do to improve the Team retention and Refactoring rate in coming time It would be great if someone addresses these concerns with valid insights

original post on our website Hey folks we have some exciting news to share about the structure of Haveno We recently opened a CCS proposal to crowdfund the money to pay the frontend team that will build the user interface of Haveno During the conversation people expressed the desire to see Haveno more decentralized and censorshipresistant The main concern was related to the so called operators a third party entity that would have managed the live exchange while the Haveno Core Team HCT would have taken care of the code and everything else not related to the live platform Adopting this structure wasnt an easy choice but we decided it was the best option at the time while constantly brainstorming on ways to decentralize Haveno While the CCS was open and being discussed some Monero community members came up with some ideas to decentralize Haveno We thought some of the suggestions were valid and a good base to work on so we closed the CCS and started to work on a more decentralized structure This is very exciting for us The idea behind Haveno sparked out of the desire to provide a decentralized and P2P platform where people can sell and buy Monero for fiat or other cryptocurrencies while at the same time fund and support Monero development This new structure will make it much easier to reach that goal Moneros Engine The structure we have in mind is fairly simple and we hope the community will be as excited about it as we are Haveno will be developed on the repositories managed by the HCT and will always be free and open source software developed by the HCT with the help and support of the community The idea is to send 100 of the fees paid by users on Haveno to a CCS system that from now on we will call Engine Engine will work very similarly to the CCS managed by the Monero Core Team MCT The difference is that the funds will be provided by the fees generated by Haveno instead of generous donors You probably already see where we are going Engine will receive a constant stream of funds that can be used to fund Monero development No more need to rely on donors Monero will finally become selfsustaining which would be a major achievement toward autonomy and independence People will be able to propose their skills or maybe even post bounties The Haveno and Monero communities will be called to comment on these proposals and the Engine Council will take the final decision about approving or rejecting the proposal The Engine Council would have the same role the MCT currently has in the Monero CCS Engine Council We propose that the Engine Council is composed of 5 members of the Haveno and Monero communities More specifically we would like to have at least 1 member of the Monero Core Team 1 longterm monero developer and 1 Haveno community member chosen by the HCT in the council The other members could be chosen within the Haveno and Monero communities The Haveno Core Team wont be part of the council As said the council will vote to acceptrefuse proposals A multisig wallet could be set up among members which will continuously receive the funds from Haveno With this structure Haveno wont need third parties or legal entities since all fees earnings will be directly sent to the Engine fund after every trade The HCT and Haveno development The Haveno core team will open Engine proposals every 612 months asking to receive monthly half of the total fees sent to Engine in one month as a compensation This will assure the work of the HCT will stay accountable to the community and ensure the leads of the projects are rewarded for their efforts at the moment we are funding ourselves This structure will make the action of the HCT accountable to the community which will decide through the Engine Council if they want to keep supporting the work of the HCT It will also make development much more flexible the current bountybased system could be kept and the Engine system would work in parallel giving people the possibility to open Engine proposal and get compensated for working on Monero or Haveno Its important to note that the HCT is very different from the MCT The MCT adopts a handsoff approach while we do the opposite The HCT leads and is deeply involved in Haveno development and community growthmanagement Arbitrators and seednodes Arbitrators are a fundamental part of Haveno and will resolve trade disputes They are sensitive role because they hold one of the 3 keys of a trade on Haveno Arbitrators will be trustworthy community members who will apply for the role through Engine proposals The community will vote and the Engine Council will take the final decision The HCT will respect the decision of the Council and will provide arbitrators all the tools and support they need Arbitrators will be paid through Engine proposals and will be free to offer their terms to the community This would open a market of arbitrators and will allow Haveno to scale In the future Arbitrators speaking languages different than english will be required for example Seednodes will be run by the Haveno Core Team but also by community members to ensure more network resistance Note that seednodes are a sensitive part of the network and their operators have to be trusted members of the community The HCT reserves the right to only add to the code base seed nodes that are run by long term and trusted MoneroHaveno community members The alternative An alternative to Engine would be to rely on the MCT Instead of creating a dedicated system we could rely on the existent CCS managed by the Monero Core team This would centralize things on the MCT but could make people more comfortable since they are a trusted entity that stewards the Monero project We are already in talk with the core team to see what they think about the two options How we see the future The important for us is to keep Haveno decentralized and community focused We will always be looking to improve these aspects thats why we dont exclude different governance system in the future For example could be interesting to plug Haveno into an external DAO for governance Could be even more interesting to build this DAO on Monero In the future we could have colored coins on the Monero blockchain or other mechanisms to empower the community There are infinite possibilities The point is that with the constant stream of funds Haveno will provide we will open the doors to a lot of possibilities that went unexplored until now because of the absence of a reliable stream of funds Lets make a practical example Bisqs revenue in the month of January was about 66k USD source In Haveno the entire amount will be sent to Engine but the HCT will request half of the amount through an engine proposal This means about 33K USD will be available for funding whatever the community thinks should be funded to push Monero and Haveno forward Now imagine how many improvementsprojects we could fund with that amount of funds coming regularly While we dont expect to reach Bisqs revenue numbers right after launch we do think that Bisq is massively underperforming and we believe Haveno could dwarf their numbers in the future Conclusion These are exciting times Funding is the main issue of any open source project See for example Bitcoin that has recently seen developers leaving the project because they could not afford to work on it as volunteers anymore and there were no chances of being funded The Engine system would resolve this problem and revolutionize the way Monero is developed all while making it selfsustaining We look forward to receive feedback from the community

network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I generate a Ledger Monero Wallet with the GUI or CLI This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Check this page for the GUI instructions and this page for the

transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this

network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this

network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I generate a Ledger Monero Wallet with the GUI or CLI This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Check this page for the GUI instructions and this page for the

is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR

link on GitLab What The goal is to create opensource software that aids people mining Monero with excess solar power in the most profitable way It will accommodate for issues such as Time of day Weather fluctuations Avoiding depleting batteries below a threshold that would damage them Avoiding overheating the mining rig Leaving enough power for your daily use Intro I promised Id help out in the Monero Recruitment Matrix Room Although there was just one direct request to me so far recently Ive also proactively proposed cooperation to the chat room members I presented there 2 projects that are on my mind and dont require extensive crypto knowledge typically not available to students Yet the projects are still useful for Monero specifically One of the projects that I have on mind is optimization of mining performance on a solar farm depending on varying inputs The member Endor endorxmr on GitHub and endor00 on Matrix signed up for being the main contributor to the project while I would serve as a mentor namely coordinator reviewer and designer Such a setup will guarantee that I wont get dragged away too much from the maintenance of Monero that I signed up for while at the same time Endor will be able to continuously have access to my years of experience in automatic control and object oriented design Endor on the other hand is heavily involved in everything thats connected to mining profitability Should Endor not make it until the deadline I guarantee that I will finalize the project by myself until the coming winter Introducing the project SolOptXMR Solar Optimal mining of XMR Why The following YT video is able to bring you more context why this idea has a chance for being a trending subject and is here to stay The outline of this video is the following Because of high initial as well as perpetual investments required for producing power from solar collectors in SaharaNevada and delivering it to northern states such an investment contrived in the previous decade under the name DESERTEC turned out to be not the best possible investment The projects relative profitability decreased across the years even more The reason is that the costs of production of solar panels dropped so low that now it makes more sense to place them exactly where the produced power is most needed even though the solar irradiation is lesser at these places On a sentiment geopolitical side of things with the rising prices of heating gas I expect many people will be wanting to save on their gas costs by switching to electrical heating Since the majority of such heaters demand high power ranging from 2kW to 25kW and since a given population will typically want to switch them on all at the same time I predict that well be facing a decent wave of blackouts in the coming winter This has motivated me to build my solar farm If you are an individual who likes to take the matters into your own hands you might have considered building a small solar farm yourself Although our system wont assume a given users setup my particular farm is configured as an isolated island This means that I dont sell my overproduction to the grid for the pennies that the state offers but rather use the production for mining and cooking while the overproduction is temporarily stored in a pair of cheap but reliable car batteries My farm serves as a perfect test bed for the system that were going to design and automate for you Optimized mining of Monero on such a system amortizes the installation costs over the long run will help you learn about electricity and motivate you to become more resilient Further compatible extensions are possible such as small wind generators as well as bikes with flywheels that recover kinetic energy Such systems are already available on the market that tends to think ahead of the time so you dont have to DIY System description The dynamics of the system that tries to optimize the mining efficiency has to take into account the following inputs and goals Some of them are obvious while others maybe not so much Static astronomic data that describe the relative movement of the Sun across the sky in various latitudes and times of year yielding the maximal expected power that can be reached Weather predictions a cloudy sky can reduce the power output by more than 80 If the predicted power generation is off the measured generation a warning might be issued to clean the panels Voltage load state of the batteries as well as voltage that reaches the DCAC transformer as some of it might be lost in the cables that are either too long or have accidentally formed an inductor Predicted load state of the batteries on the next day before the Sun rises and the charging starts as emptying the chemical batteries below 50 tends to damage them Mining rigs temperature readouts as its not worth to meltdown your hardware for those couple of Piconeros being mined A given computers hashrate per Watt use the most efficient ones first but dont overheat them A given computers idle power cost sometimes it will make sense to switch on certain less efficient computers only if theres really way too much power production andor the most efficient ones overheat or its predicted that theyd overheat soon under the also predicted future conditions Per core efficiency compared against multithreaded efficiency for CPUs with smaller caches the efficiency in this case hashrate scales poorly with more threads working at the same time In such cases it will make sense to spread the mining across longer periods of time on a single core The owners power usage habits taking into account that you might want to use a low powered compatible electric heating system at a given time of day by leaving some energy in the batteries for you to consume before the predicted event learned either from your usage habits or from your manually scheduled input The owners setup whether an isolated solar island is used output connected to grid for selling or supplementing power losses from the grid buying or both of the last 2 options The control mechanisms of the system would be the following Downclocking the CPUs very easy to achieve under Linux with a high precision thus allowing for a smooth control Restarting the mining with a smaller number of cores Putting computers to sleep and waking them up with Wake On LAN on the next day While it would be easy enough to control the system via PID controller and I know a lot about it such a system would have little prediction power delivered only by the first differential part of the controller the D and only between the current and the previous state Using a Time Series Analysis and Prediction tool such as the already available tsqsim will give the system the ability to look ahead into the future like at least 48 hours ahead and plan accordingly to maximize the gain per the unit of energy used while at the same time planning carefully against overheat of the hardware undervoltage of the DCAC transformer leading to an immediate halt of the system as well as against undervoltage as in capacity of the batteries which would otherwise quickly damage them The inputs to the system will come in a few forms either assumed input by the user or measured The measurements can be easily supplied via smart plugs or measured directly Ultimately it has to be left to the user to decide how much time to spend on providing additional inputs that result in improvements of predictions thus profitability The goal here is however to keep the measurements optional not to impose burden on the user Who mj working for Monero since 2 years on the purely technical level Speeding up compilation and Continuous Integration on GitHub keeping an eye on overall efficiency generating Monero health report reviewing technical PRs helping out new developers Lately developing Time Series Analysis tool for Monero Research Lab called tsqsim Heres a list of all my contributions to Monero and to the supporting software Endor Aerospace Engineering student and a junior Python developer on the side I already have a few small projects under my belt one of which related to automation and monitoring of a live system Ive been following the Monero project for over 5 years learning the ins and outs of cryptocurrency mining and moderating the Supportxmr chat and the Monero Mining room on Matrix xmrminematrixorg I am currently developing a comprehensive economic model of mining and I plan to publish a small paperseries of articles over the next few weeks that will hopefully serve as the ultimate guide to mining for newcomers and professionals alike A glimpse into my work can be seen in this minimalistic script that dynamically calcylates the CPUs mining

telemetry by default unless the user wishes to have their data uploaded and analyzed The data will surely serve as a stabilization asset of the project and will be included in the automated system tests as one of many test cases The complete data set to be sent will always be shown to the user for a review and approval As Im familiar with the EU laws regarding solar panels a bit I will be providing the users nonlegallybinding relevant advice Even though Im not strictly an electrical engineer I know enough tricks in this field and I understand many nuances about the inner workings of such systems I know what hardware are compatible with each other and how to calculate the supply and demand of the produced power Therefore I can provide advice in this field as well yet again nonlegallybinding Proposal As of 25 March XMREUR is at 182 EUR mj I will be able to spend about 10 hours week on the project An amount so low that it doesnt collide with my maintenance assignment nor

like to share this project that I am working on and ask for your thumbs up if you think it deserves Thank you very much in advance The gitlab proposal is here TLDR Minimal Python tools and educational material for checking inflation in Monero Check the initial scratch here I would like your support to finish it What and Why I will try to address the following issues 1 Provide solid information about inflation This project is highly focused on building the minimum necessary tools in Python to prove that there is no money leakage inflation occurring or that has occurred Therefore the community is welcome to use the tools provided here and also make improvement suggestions on how to answer this question in the most decisive way 2 Educational material This work also intends to convey the message that Monero is as safe or more as Bitcoin cryptographically speaking Therefore some educational material is provided for the layman and for someone looking to understand the code Convincing someone about something may require different levels of explanations This work tries to address this issue 3 Provide more transparency and ease the fear of users and investors Nobody heavily invests into something that they do not understand This work provides more transparency and education on how the blockchain works with the focus on the inflation issue Therefore users would feel safer by investing and using Monero 4 Provide some implementations of the C code in Python This work also intends to provide more tools in Python so users can have more independence from the C code in verifying the blockchain which the great majority of people heavily relies on If useful functions are implemented here it could also help in the future other people to make different implementations of wallets and nodes in Python for example 5 Overview of blockchain history focused on the inflation issue Any successful project has to be able to tell its history in the most detailed way for the newcomers that did not live the events that happened in the past Therefore scanning the whole blockchain looking for leakages and providing some educational material with codes some stats and insights is crucial not only for the new members but actually for anyone who wants to revisit the history Who I would like to stay anonymous for the moment I believe that the goal of the CCS is to fund an idea instead of a person so if I do not do the job the CCS can fund someone else to do it in the way it was proposed here I have never contributed to Monero and I actually got onboard recently although I know its existence for some years I started investigating after this post on reddit I have a broad set of experiences like web design Python coding applied math and economics I am highly motivated to work on this project as it is almost an existential question for me I am pretty sure that I am capable of doing it following the proposed time schedule as I have been working in this project for the past two months already About the proposal First I would like to thank everyone in the MRL channel for pointing me some directions I believe that basically what needs to be done is the creation of Python scripts and educational materials in order to check the ring signatures check the amounts involved check the uniqueness of key images and check the emission curve These tasks have to be done for the PreRingCT era MLSAG and CLSAG As I have already done a scratch for the PreRingCT v1 era it is not ready yet but I strongly recommend you to check out the temporary version to have an idea how the final product will look like I still need to do improve the PreRingCT era and create the necessary material for the MLSAG and CLSAG I also propose to create some educational material and scripts for Seraphis This work does not intend to end the discussion about inflation in Monero it is quite the opposite it looks for providing tools and educational material so people can have the same base for a serious and structured discussion about it I do not expect to deliver the message that you should blindly trust in Monero but I expect to deliver a message which will raise the awareness on the inflation issue I will do my best to reply in a meaningful way the concerns of the community and I also will be constantly in touch with the developers and the ones that have much more knowledge than me they have been really nice and kind so far to explain the inflation issue in the best way Importance for the community Give some material and orientation for the ones looking to increase their understanding about the Monero blockchain with the focus on the inflation issue Create Python functions ring signature verifiers and others to check the real data stored in the blockchain Give more transparency and explanation to the verification process of a transaction Reduce the fear of investors that do not understand how Monero can be transparent and at the same time private Milestones and payouts First milestone Codes nice explanation and some stats about MLSAG Date End of May Amount 144 XMR Second milestone Codes nice explanation and some stats about CLSAG Date End of June Amount 144 XMR Third milestone More codes and explanations Seraphis clean website optimizations and corrections Date End of August Amount 144 XMR I propose to work for 18 USD per hour 30h per week for 16 weeks Which means 183016 8640 USD 200 USD 432 XMR Total 432 XMR I will also pay for the costs to host the website and buy a meaningful domain name for the project About deliveries I will make all the content codes images texts available and free to use modify share and do whatever you want As soon as I finish some task I will make them available Expiration Date It would be nice if it get funded before 30042022 so I can keep the expected timeline Thank you very much in advance

How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

gasp a post for FAQ and some answers to common questions Ill try to start with the least controversial stuff FAQ and work my way towards my personal beliefs but its all kinda mixed together despite my best efforts Here goes What is the idea here Why are we making a big push to withdraw Monero from CEX After a couple years of scrutinizing the larger exchanges the Monero community has come to a loose consensus that many exchanges dont actually hold all of the Monero which customers have purchased Unfortunately many people in crypto arent aware of this practice sometimes called fractional reserve We are hoping to reach these people and help them understand that the best thing they can do for their investment is to withdraw to their own wallet Wait why would that be good for their investment Are you saying this is like a short squeeze Exactly Selling a claim on an asset you dont have is technically a naked short When an exchange claims to hold 10s of thousands of XMR on behalf of their customers but dont have never actually purchased those XMR it means that those purchases were never reflected in price because it never reduced the liquid supply of Monero available on the market The exchange just sold a promise not a real asset The other obvious reason why this is good for you is that now you dont have to hope pray and beg an exchange to give your funds when you need them I still dont understand why would withdrawing the Monero make price go up At the point that you withdraw real Monero that you verify in your own wallet with your own keys the exchange must have first purchased or already held that XMR It cant pay you in promises it must pay you with cryptography onchain It forces the exchange to make a real purchase of XMR to send to you But cant the exchanges just freeze withdraws Yes they can and many already have In fact weve never seen so many exchanges freezing withdraws simultaneously as we have the past week or so So if you cant withdraw and the exchange doesnt have the Monero then doesnt that mean the price will stay the same Nothing forces them to purchase Monero Exactly Which is why my recommendation if that happens to you is to swap your claim on nonexistent Monero to some other coin that the exchange does have Then withdraw that coin and convert to Monero on an exchange that has been historically reliable And of course still withdraw to your own wallet But doesnt that just let them off the hook Yes and no 1 Would you rather have a claim on something the exchange never intended to pay you anyways Why wouldnt you do whats best for you and get out of there ASAP by any means possible 2 In the larger picture even if you have to withdraw another coin youre still pulling some kind of crypto liquidity away from that exchage Exchanges live and die by having real customers with real crypto and liquidity 3 Youre taking away their power to continue the charade Youre contibuting to a movement which exposes and publicizes which exchanges are abusing their customers and manipulating markets with naked shorts Youre helping others to avoid ending up in the same situation or highlighting to why they also need to get off that exchange 4 Youll be converting to Monero elsewhere which has the effect of reducing the available market supply and driving up price At a minimum this creates a larger nominal liability for the exchange and it reduces their ability to manipulate markets for their profit against ordinary users Which exchanges are the most reliable and least likely to freeze my funds We can only use inferences and past behavior Things are changing daily but right now here are your best options that I know of KYC CEX Fiat to Monero Kraken If not in NY UK Australia Japan or Korea either North or South localmoneroco Be sure to use someone reputable Youll be sorta KYCd by proxy if using wire or Zelle just fyi CEX but no KYC cryptocrypto CakeWallet Changenowio TradeOgre Exodus they take 9 fee beware Morphtoken VPN no Tor available DEX Bisq XMRBTC only Sideshift Im not 100 sure on this one if its working or not Go to a Monero meetup or a crypto meetup and buy from frens MINING more like the long game Mining wont make you rich because everyone with a CPU can do it But you can get some If youre already mining with GPU or ASICs on another chain Nicehash will pay you XMR if thats what you select Be forewarned they have frozen XMR withdraws before for an entire month Why April 18th Moneros birthday Wont people just frontrun April 18th Should I pull my funds sooner than that It looks like people have been frontrunning this date for a couple weeks now So go for it Front run early and frontrun often Personally I already set a sidestack to buy on the 18th no matter what the price Cant exchanges just frontrun this event too Stock up on Monero to avoid looking like the bad guy Why yes they can and wise exchanges wouldve done this already This is also part of what we mean by force the issue Because if they have to buy real Monero thats good for us either way Either they meet their promises in which case the price of Monero is closer to an honest market value or the exchange is outed as a liar And price seems to be rising against the rest of crypto trend so someone out there is probably buying Will buying Monero on an exchange that is still open for withdraws help this initiative Absolutely Not only does it strengthen the community to have more people using Monero P2P rather than through an intermediary it protects your financial privacy and it makes it progressively harder and more expensive for any fractionally reserved exchanges to continue their charade Dont exchanges do this with other coins too Its very likely that they do We believe its more prolific with Monero due to the obfuscated ledger Typically large exchange wallet addresses are known and visible onchain but this isnt possible with Monero Will this cause a price divergence to develop between exchanges with and without Monero Maybe Its possible that an exchange which freezes withdraws could just peg their faku price to an honest exchange and pretend that theyre doing wallet maintenance for weeks on end Last year we did see a price divergence by up to 25 between frozen and liquid exchanges Wouldnt arbitration arb bots just equalize any price differences Arb bots require the ability to withdraw from the exchange with a low price and deposit on an exchange with the higher price But if the exchange withdraws are frozen arb bots cant perform their job It wont hurt exchanges because theyre not required by law to hold reserves Were more about direct community action rather than begging the govt to come save us Theres no one here for us but us Maybe someone down the line will take legal action but thats a separate issue Its hopeless theyre all in it together nothing we can do to change things While I can appreciate the merits of limited nihilistic philosophy the truth is we dont really know for sure what we can do unless we give it the ole college try Right now things are looking optimistic It will cause an inconvenience for people in need of acquiring Monero Maybe Or maybe fewer people will be defrauded going forwards because bad exchanges will be better known and avoided Maybe people with Monero would be willing to sell some at a higher price for real goods and services And lets not forget isnt that kind of the point of being early You get the good seats while latecomers might have to wait in line and sit in the nosebleed section Do you know any severely discounted sailboat companies willing to do excursions around the Bermuda Triangle late this summer Im more of an aviation enthusiast myself But I suppose we could have a life preserver meetup when my aerial rescue party encounters strong downdrafts and has to ditch enroute to the capsized Monero cruiseliner Okay thats about all the questions I could think of Hope its useful

that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

balance to unlock Your balance is unlocked after 10 confirmations which means 10 mined blocks A block is mined approximately every two minutes on the Monero network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I

How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

funds tXMR available Hello Moneroans As many of you know next month is a major milestone for Monero First the tail emission will begin around June 8 Second a major Monero release is coming out around June 16 version 018 Flourine Fermi This is a significant upgrade to the Monero network with major enhancements including but not limited to Mandatory ringsize increased to 16 better privacy Bulletproofs reduced transaction sizes View tags significantly reduced wallet sync times Block weight algorithm adjustments improved network security You can read more about this upgrade at GetMoneroorg here As you can imagine a fair amount of work remains to be done before this version goes live One of these tasks is testing the new software for errors and bugs The Monero testnet is where the majority of the testing will happen and today the Monero testnet officially forked into the upcoming Flourine Fermi network version We need your help with testing this new version All you need to do is join testnet and test out the Monero software there What is the Monero testnet Did you know that a second Monero network exists a network with its own hashrate and money supply This is the Monero testnet It is way smaller and the funds are not worth any actual real world money but the network functions virtually the same as the main network itself sometimes called mainnet In fact the testnet is often more advanced than mainnet because this is where the most cutting edge enhancements to Monero are being tested out How to join testnet To join testnet and help test the upcoming new Monero version for bugs simply launch your GUI or CLI with the testnet flag For the GUI this means selecting the testnet option under Advanced when creating a new wallet However its much better to use the CLI commandline interface to test Monero because if something goes wrong its likely easier to see a description of the error To get the CLI software for the upcoming release you will need to use the instructions at Github to build Monero from source These instructions will be different for Linux Windows or Mac Note even though the instructions at Github ask you to git checkout releasev017 you must ignore this command This way you will build the CLI from the main master branch of the repository Note we need testers for all platforms Windows Mac x64 vs ARM Linux distros etc because often there are often specific errors for each operating system Once you have built the new software from source simply launch the Monero daemon monerod with the testnet flag For a pruned blockchain on Linux or Mac the command would be monerod pruneblockchain testnet I have never used Windows but I assume the command is similar monerodexe pruneblockchain testnet Once the daemon is running and fully synced may take an hour or so you can create a testnet wallet which you can do by running monerowalletcli testnet Once your wallet is created you can send and receive Monero testnet funds tXMR How to test for bugs Testing for bugs is as easy or as difficult as you want to make it If you simply want to make a few wallets and pass funds back and forth between them to see if transferring funds works thats great We need every kind of testing for this major release Even more helpful is if you can test the more uncommonly used commands that Monero uses These are usually the bugs that are easier to find For example test offline transaction signing Test freezing outputs or encrypting your seed phrase You can see the list of commands to be tested within the CLI by opening a testnet wallet and typing help all It is helpful to join the monerodev chat channel on IRC Liberachat as you test the new software since you can ask any questions that arise and post any bugs you find Reporting bugs is pretty easy The best way is to paste the error text into click the Send button and post the link into an Issue on Github or into the dev channel on IRC You can also use this testnet block explorer Its worth mentioning that the main code branch of Monero will likely be updated at various times in the coming weeks as different patches and enhancements get approved via PRs or pullrequests When this happens you may need to move your testnet wallet out of the build directory run a git pull and make clean command and rebuild the CLI binaries like the monerod and monerowalletcli files so as to include these new patches and fixes in your further testing How to get tXMR testnet funds Simply post your testnet address in the comments and I will personally send you 50 tXMR The other option is you mine testnet for some coins This is easy and fun since the hashrate on testnet is relatively low currently 6200 hashessecond so you can usually get some testnet by simply mining for a short period using a single thread of your computer or VPS Side note its fun to mine testnet funds because you will see a small picture of what mining Monero was like when it first launched in 2014 creating hashes on your home computer using the CLI the GUI did not exist back then and waiting for that exciting BLOCK FOUND text to appear Thats it Post your testnet address in the address below and I will send you 50 tXMR You are free to send some funds back to my testnet address here 9wog1AwLTJRKCMgs7ZbCZGVJa26eve3ZU4hpxTBYxpp8LGUMiioB1shjS5aibER2AvY8bpDRiNRw929FMpxmeeuy9vQnRH6 Further questions Feel free to

How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for

that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

Continued development for 4 months Hello everyone thanks for all the support and feedback weve gotten over the last few months Weve successfully completed all of the goals we set for ourselves in our first CCS proposal and we have now opened our second CCS proposal for continued development of the UnstoppableSwap GUI If this is the first time you have heard of us heres a quick summary UnstoppableSwap GUI is a Graphical User Interface for XMRBTC Atomic Swaps It is being built around the MVP developed by the COMIT guys and will empower even nontechnical people to swap their BTC for XMR in a safe decentralized and trustless manner We finished our initial prototype which can be used on testnet and in theory on mainnet but thats not yet open to the public See this post to see the GUI in action on Mainnet We initially developed a web interface which is now obsolete and will be replaced by the GUI Please leave your feedback andor support on the Gitlab merge request Proposal copy of the Gitlab merge request UnstoppableSwap CSS Proposal 2 Weve successfully completed all of the goals we set for ourselves in our first CCS proposal The prototype of the GUI we wanted to develop is fully functional on testnet and it will soon replace the now obsolete web interface UnstoppableSwapnet Based on the community response to both of our status updates reddit post 1 reddit post 2 we felt that there is a strong desire in the community for us to continue development Over the course of 7 months we have Made over 175 commits to the UnstoppableSwap GUI repository and developed an initial working prototype Demo video of mainnet swap Demo video of decentralized peer discover Ive become one of the three unpaid volunteers maintaining the xmrbtcswap repository after the comit guys original developers who developed the first MVP have moved on to other projects Ive submitted and merged 12 Pull Requests over the last months and reviewed some more Proposal We are excited to keep working on Atomic Swaps There are still loads of things needed to make it accessible and easy to use for everyone Therefore wed like to continue spending our time working on the FOSS GUI for BTCXMR Atomic Swaps It is being built around the swapcli and will empower even nontechnical people to swap their BTC for XMR in a safe decentralized and trustless manner We are asking for 148 XMR for continued development for 4 months At the end of each month 37 XMR will be paid out Who I am binarybaron the creator of UnstoppableSwapnet and Monero enthusiast I was excited about Atomic Swaps from the very beginning tested the first versions MVP developed by COMIT guys and contributed to the project early on When the first testnet swap provider came online I realized that we would need a better user interface and a platform to compare different swap providers I decided to start building UnstoppableSwapnet To my surprise the interest was much greater than I could have ever predicted In the first week alone the website was visited more than 150000 times Once I realized that a website was not enough due to the technical requirements I started working on a desktop app Soon after I submitted my first CCS which was quickly funded and developed the first working prototype of the desktop user interface What 1 Development of the graphical user interface GUI 1 Auto Update For this to work well need to code sign the releases on Mac OS using a paid certificate The GUI will download and install the new version on startup if a new release is available 2 Educate users on the rules of the swap protocol There are some simple but important rules all users need to follow to avoid loosing funds Most importantly the functionality of the cancel and refund timelocks must be understood If users are not fully aware on how to act in certain scenarios they risk loosing funds Were not yet sure how to proceed on this Some ideas are outlined below 1 Quiz at first startup to make sure the user understands what rules he needs to follow 2 Refer to official documentation of the swapcli and the GUI 3 Refer to blog posts videos and other online resources by the community 3 Allow manual cancel refund of swaps Although the swapcli should refund swaps automatically in most cases there are some edge cases where the user is required to cancel refund manually This is currently not possible in the GUI Enabling the user to easily do this in the GUI is a must 4 Unit and Integration tests Although the GUI is relatively stable it has pretty low test coverage We need to create a lot more unit and possibly integration tests to cover all edge cases Especially critical code like the internal finite state machine needs extensive test coverage 5 New Icon The current icon was only meant to be a placeholder and wasnt intended to be final Well either commision someone to make a new one or ask the community for input 6 Performance improvements We need to investigate what the performance bottlenecks of the GUI are The most obvious ones at the moment are 1 Inefficient SQL queries being used for querying the swap database 2 Overlycautious file reads of the swap database 3 Unnecessary rerenders of React components 4 Blocking code being run in the main thread leading to freezing of the whole application 7 General improvement of the GUI Fixing bugs responding to issues writing documentation and implementing new features as they come to mind 8 Switch the GUI from Testnet to Mainnet The GUI is currently Testnet only Once we feel it is stable enough overall well switch it over to Mainnet 2 Development and maintenance of the API that enables clients to easily discover swap providers A swap provider is a peer you can connect with to exchange your BTC for XMR Our API indexes them and provides additional data such as their uptime and their age This API is publicly accessible and can be used by other services eg orangefrencom We provide an HTTPs and a WebSocket socketio endpoint which will be documented on UnstoppableSwapnet 3 Development and maintenance of the UnstoppableSwapnet site It was the first initial prototype for a user interface for Atomic Swaps It used to be a very stripped down version of the GUI and allowed users to more easily initiate a swap using the swapcli by displaying them with a command they could copy and paste This was not ideal as it gave the impression of being userfriendly but could be quite confusing and risky to use The site will be converted into a simple download page for the GUI similar to bisqnetwork 4 Maintenance of rendezvous point There are currently three major ways for users to discover swap providers peers they can swap their Bitcoin for Monero with This proposal also includes the maintenance of the rendezvous point we run 1 Wordofmouth The community can share the address of swap providers online eg on Reddit IRC Matrix 2 Centralized peer discovery via UnstoppableSwap API We actively maintain a database of swap providers which can be used by anyone to retrieve a list of swap providers 3 Rendezvous point The rendezvous protocol is a lightweight mechanism for generalized peer discovery It allows for the discovery of peers in a decentralized fashion We operate a community rendezvous point through which swap providers can make themselves known to users and through which users can find swap providers with whom they want to swapdns4discoverunstoppableswapnettcp8888p2p12D3KooWA6cnqJpVnreBVnoro8midDL9Lpzmg8oJPoAGi7YYaamE 5 Reviewing merging and possibly submitting Pull Requests to the xmrbtcswap repository 1 This proposal is mainly for continued development of the GUI and not for maintenance of the xmrbtcswap project Time spent on the repository will at most be 5 of the total time spent on this proposal 2 Most of the Pull Requests well submit will be related to making the swapcli compatible with the GUI If funded well provide monthly updates in the CCS comment section

Data on Banking the Unbanked in the US through Cryptocurrency TLDR Based on new highquality data people in the US who do not have a bank account are more likely to use cryptocurrency as a means of payment for goods and services The data does not have specifics on Monero use but since Monero is a leading transactional cryptocurrency that is banking the unbanked I think my analysis belongs here Earlier this week the US Federal Reserve released probably the best data yet available on the use of cryptocurrency among people in the United States For the first time the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking included questions on cryptocurrency Wisely the designers of the survey distinguished between three different ways to use cryptocurrency The survey asked In the past year have you done the following with cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum Bought or held as an investment Used to buy something or make a payment Used to send money to friends or family Ill focus on Used to buy something or make a payment since that best represents the concept of people using cryptocurrency to replace electronic banking rather than using it as a speculative investment Only about 2 percent of survey respondents said yes to this question but since the survey collected data from about 10000 people the sample size is large enough to carry out an indepth analysis The true power of this data comes from the extensive list of questions that survey respondents were asked We can go much further than just tallying up the number of cryptocurrency users because the Federal Reserve released the survey microdata ie data on the responses of each survey respondent to each question Fixing Omitted Variable Bias to Isolate the Statistical Relationship The main relationship that I want to investigate is the relationship between having a bank account or credit card and using cryptocurrency as a means of payment However we know that younger people in the United States are both more likely to use cryptocurrency and less likely to have a bank account or credit card Any relationship between cryptocurrency use and being unbanked could be entirely driven by the effects of age on both variables leading to incorrect conclusions As it turns out gender is also important Below is a visualization of a correlation matrix between several key variables in the dataset x200B Correlation Matrix of Financial Marginalization and Use of Cryptocurrency as Payment We can see that lacking a bank account and using cryptocurrency as a payment means is slightly positively correlated 004 The corresponding correlation for lacking a credit card is somewhat weaker 003 The plot also shows that older people are less likely to use cryptocurrency as payment and are more likely to have a bank account or credit card Being male is positively associated with using cryptocurrency as payment and lacking a bank account or credit card To isolate the relationship between using cryptocurrency as payment and financial marginalization I used a logit regression and put age and gender in the same statistical equation Results According to my analysis people who lack a bank account have 80 higher odds of using cryptocurrency as a means of payment We do not have quite enough data to conclude anything about the relationship between lacking a credit card and using cryptocurrency as payment pvalue 016 Other measures of financial marginalization tell the same story Being rejected for credit purchasing a money order from a nonbank source cashing a check at someplace other than a bank taking a payday loan taking a pawn shop or auto title loan experiencing discrimination in banking or a loan application and getting a tax refund advance are all positively associated with using cryptocurrency as a means of payment In fact many of these measures have a stronger relationship with using cryptocurrency as payment than lacking a bank account does For instance people who report experiencing discrimination in banking or applying for a loan have 618 percent greater odds of using cryptocurrency as a means of payment Using cryptocurrency as a means of payment was also associated with personal characteristics that could lead to marginalization in US society in general Experiencing discrimination for any reason being Black being Hispanic and being a noncitizen are all positively associated with using cryptocurrency as a means of payment There was no clear relationship when the statistical model included LGBTQ status Sanity Checks on Data Quality Given that 2021 was the first year that the cryptocurrency questions were asked in this survey we may be concerned with data quality After all survey respondents could have decided to respond randomly to these questions One way to calibrate confidence in the data quality is to see if relationships that we observe in the world around us are present in the data I checked subject matter of educational degree and willingness to take risks which in the real world are most likely correlated with use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment The results say that Computer Science is the only degree that is statistically significant in its relationship with use of cryptocurrency as payment Higher willingness to take risks is strongly associated with use of cryptocurrency as payment The data passes these basic quality checks What about statistics in the aggregate Do the total report number of cryptocurrency users align with other data Corroborating data on people using cryptocurrency as a means of payment is hard to obtain but data on using cryptocurrency as an investment is available from centralized exchanges The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking indicated that about 11 percent of adults in the US bought or held cryptocurrency as an investment or about 29 million people As a publiclytraded company Coinbase must accurately report its user numbers In its most recent annual report to shareholders Coinbase said it had 89 million verified users in 2021 Coinbase does not report its user numbers by country but it does separate revenue by geographic location About 80 of its revenue came from the United States Granted revenue per user is likely higher in the US than in the rest of the world Nevertheless these numbers from Coinbase alone suggest that the data from the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking about cryptocurrency use is not a gross overestimate Conclusion Frankly the results surprised me Using cryptocurrency to bank the unbanked has always seemed like a nice aspirational slogan that may eventually become a reality if the stars align but these statistical results suggest that its starting to become a reality right now Even the Federal Reserve noticed in its report on the survey results stating those using cryptocurrencies for purchases rather than as investments frequently lacked traditional bank and credit card accounts The Federal Reserves figures did not attempt to correct for omitted variable bias or dive deeper into other factors at play like my analysis has done These results for unbanked people in the United States are in contrast to those of a recent working paper Alvarez Argente Van Patten 2022 that carried out a survey in El Salvador and found that usage of bitcoin for everyday transactions is low and is concentrated among the banked educated young and male population The unbanked in the United States likely have greater access to the internet than the unbanked in El Salvador These results are also surprising given that one of the easiest ways to obtain cryptocurrency in the United States is through a bank account or credit card linked to a centralized exchange like Coinbase People who lacked bank accounts but used cryptocurrency as a means of exchange may have obtained cryptocurrency through alternative means such as CashApp PayPal or in an entirely peertopeer manner The code to reproduce the analysis is here The full statistical results are here The data from the Federal Reserve is here note that this is a gov website

that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

remember that I was funded by the community to attend the Oslo Freedom Forum an annual human rights conference run by the Human Rights Foundation I was interested in surveying how the message of Bitcoin as the tool for financial freedom was being presented especially in the light of its gregarious shortcomings as a monetary instrument for leverage against oppressive andor authoritarian governments Firstly it is important to state that the Oslo Freedom Forum this year was run over three days as opposed to the usual two It is probably also fair to say that the Financial Freedom Track comprised almost a third of the total programming time The track had a primary sponsor Seetee Seetee is a subsidiary of a very large Norweigian congloromate called Aker ASAakerasaorg Their website states Aker is the largest shareholder directly or indirectly in 11 companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange Euronext Expand Oslo or Euronext Growth Oslo at the end of March 2022 Aker and companies in which Aker is the largest investor had a total turnover of more than NOK 94 billion in 2021 and a workforce of approximately 31000 including temporary hires About 18000 of the workforce is located in Norway Secondly it is important to note that the Financial Freedom Track was a Bitcoin only track The marketing was unapologetically Bitcoin first and Lightning Network second Third there was a very strong lineup up speakers representing Bitcoin Lyn Alden Elizabeth Stark Jack Mallers Nic Carter Abubakar Nur Khali Matt Odell Lisa Neigut Troy Cross and Anita Bosch to name a few Valid questions are what did I learn what was the benefit of me being present and was it worth the 85 XMR to send me over What did I learn If it wasnt already obvious it is now The Human Rights Foundation through their Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein believes that Bitcoin is the vehicle for financial empowerment for everyone especially those that are facing oppressive regimes or authoritarian governments The overall message at the event was that Bitcoin is the answer whatever the question may be and that the Lightning Network is the vehicle to onboard a Billion users The event is littered with Bitcoin maxis easily 1015 of the total audience They had a dedicated Lightning Lounge where they showed off a LN beer vending machine make of that what you will and a LN enabled anonymous flashVPN service which actually had some merit In terms of judging the talks and interactive sessions the best way to form an opinion is to watch them yourself Sadly when you programme so many talks with nothing but Bitcoin maxis you only get one outcome biased discussions the brainwashed parroting nothing but a proBitcoin narrative in search of converting the masses Bitcoin cannot lose in this scenario other than a slight dent on its reputation Luckily most human rights advocates rights activists and journalists see through the snake oil When a onesided argument is presented with absolutely no critical voice in the proceedings it becomes obvious there is a sales pitch happening Veterans of the forum saw through the facade For example I urge people to watch the Can Bitcoin reach a billion people discussion as well as the Bitcoin the environment and human rights panel for a window into the onesided discussions It wasnt all negative though For example the final day through the interactive sessions allowed attendees to engage with panellists asking questions and engaging with the discussion probing presenters to expand on their sometimes questionable positions I also learned that they did care a little about privacy Throughout the conference there was a booklet being handed out which had a complete three pages dedicated to privacy Make of it what you will What was the benefit of me being present I know that there was not universal agreement to me going to this event and it is fair to say the return to the community is completely intangible There are two predominant benefits that I see from me being there The first is the networking Okay that sounds like corporate schmuck but it is legitimate I was able to have open and honest conversations with for example Rene Pickhardt who agreed with my reservations about the onesided nature of the panels and agreed that privacy was a sticking point However he did not agree that it was a major sticking point and that in the context of activists and freedom fighters there were larger privacy problems in the digital sphere to contend with I was able to question Troy Cross and Nic Carter about why they did not discuss asicresistance as a potential mitigation option for the environmental impact and centralisation effects of asicfriendly PoW algos I was able to discuss Monero as neutral tool as opposed to a tool for criminals Norwegian data centre mining tax incentives and the state of CBDCs with Ola Elvestuen a Norwegian member of parliament I was able to discuss Bitcoin fungibility and mined Bitcoin price premiums with Elizabeth Stark she did not believe it was a thing and knew miners who did not receive premiums for their freshly minted coins However above all the biggest benefit was to be able to question the narratives being presented unopposed The first time I took offence to something being stated was the final day at the Central Bank Digital Currencies Privacy and the Cashless Society Matthew Mezinskis Ill admit he is an idiot along with Janine Roem decided to discuss aspects of financial surveillance Not only did they decide to discuss financial surveillance with Bitcoin as the answer I might add but they also drew an analogy between the M1 supply of money and more specifically cash and Bitcoin The M1 supply of money in their eyes was analogous to the 21m Bitcoins minted they represent the selfsovereign bearer instruments in the total money supply They also believed Bitcoin was an answer to impending financial control and surveillance of CBDCs At this point I had heard enough of the parroting and I interrupted the panel First I asked if they were stating that Bitcoin was as private as the M1 supply bearer instruments Second were they stating that Bitcoin was an improvement in privacy over the current CBDC designs and if so could they please acknowledge that Bitcoin is private by default like cash This of course stirred a pot It was stated that privacy would be discussed at the dedicated privacy panel even though privacy was in the title of the panel but Matt Odell graciously agreed that Bitcoin was not private And so we move onto the Bitcoin Privacy panel You can imagine what this was like It was a shitshow Luckily in a packed room it was clear that I was not the only one that understood it was a shitshow I let things continue until Matt Odell urged the panelists to get to the QandA One question came in over recipient privacy with respect to LN invoices It was obvious this was a problem and openly admitted by the panellists I then asked two very straightforward questions 1 Was it possible for Bitcoins to be tainted and if so 2 Was it possible for Bitcoins to be censored We all know what the answer to these questions were but it was extremely important for the room probably near 100 people to hear it directly from the panelists The answers then led into an interesting bifurcated network discussion as Matts answer was to try and avoid Bitcoins touching the regulated system One attendee a Bitcoin maxi made the point that it was ok for Bitcoins to be sold on p2p markets so activists could cash out while avoiding regulationssanctions I then made the point that Bitcoin p2p markets are asymmetric as there is a known risk of buying Bitcoin on p2p markets that could contain taint Again no answer from the panellists Was it worth the Monero I cant make this value judgment as I didnt donate to the CCS If I wasnt there nobody would have missed me If I wasnt there some open discussions on the failings of Bitcoin may not have been discussed as they should If I wasnt there some of the other attendees who recognised the failings in the Bitcoin narrative would not have had the support and would perhaps not have been as quick to speak out as they were If that had not happened then Bitcoin would have got a completely uninterrupted and unopposed platform The fact that it didnt I think is worth a few piconeros in itself Summary Look The event is an important one There are very serious discussions about very serious things The human rights element of the forum is unquestionable and i would urge you to watch some of those talks they are a humbling experience Not all the Bitcoin talk was unmerited We all know the merits of what Bitcoin stands for What is important is that speakers panelists and even the maxis are honest about what Bitcoin is what Bitcoin isnt and most importantly what Bitcoin represents as a technology It does not have all the answers and shouldnt be paraded as such Yes it is an important tool but it is not the only tool Parading it as the only tool is ignorant at best and malevolent at worst and it was good in my opinion to have someone to remind them of that For the record Alex himself believes that the privacy problems of Bitcoin are hugely exaggerated and all is fine The majority of Bitcoin maxis do not believe that financial surveillance and profiling will be a thing in a Bitcoinled future The nonidiots of course understand it is a problem already

it shouldnt bother me as we all know that in our day and ages nowadays real journalism isnt even a thing no more so i guess it should just be one of those things that are totally expected but ngl it still really pissing me off for some whatever reason so for example cmc i know i know trash platform owned by binance which is a trash shady exchange and we all know that so why am i still bothered by it LOL they have that newsfeed or whatever its called with all dumb ass crypto news websites why are they calling monero a token they wouldnt call bitcoin a token right like its not like its some erc20 token on the ethereum blockchain or something like that but its own coin on its own blockchain so wtf why are they calling the tail emission the tail emission upgrade the emission is written in the code since the start of time of monero its not an upgrade its always been there they wouldnt call bitcoin block halvings the block halving upgrade so wtf so as you can see its really smol things like why am i so bothered by those very smol things errrrrrr and speaking about upgrades there actually is one coming up next month in july with that ring sig size going up from 11 to 16 funny shit is that some bitcoin maxi trashing out monero in some whatever interview like couple of months ago still thinks its at like 5 or something WTF LOL sidenote 1 2 years ago i really thought that at this time of the year in 2022 we would be so much closer of that 128 ring size from typtich which due to some limitations would now most likely be seraphis instead but uping to 16 from now is still a good move in the right direction slowly but surely and thank you to all the contributors aiming at those goals for a real fungible digital cash either way those dumb ass articles would never mention that or if they do would do it in a way that is very misleading and could indirectly hint to some sort of fud or whatever like omg its gonna hard fork hinting to their crypto illiterate readers that it might chain split cause some whatever controversy like the btcbch bchbsv dramas then those semi crypto literate btc maxi be like omg why u hard forking so much lol its so bad btc dont do that btc so so good lol errrrrr and then comparing those whatever articles like recently being all like omg fluffypony having those hundreds and hundreds of charge fraud the dude cofunded montero hinting that omfg fluffypony gonna mt gox the shit outta those poor montero holders can u imagine and comparing that to moneroobserver like fuck me if there is some actual journalism out there that would be that like even when up until last year i was maintaining one of the monero platform and trying my best to properly post announcements about whats new to keep the community informed on whats what like network upgrades cligui upgrades p2pool public dev chats times and when they were live and such given i was doing that for free without ccs but even if i made a ccs for it that still wouldnt have been close to moneroobserver level so massive props to the maintainer of that like that to me shows how cringe the state of journalism and fuck the internet as a whole be and to some extent even how the world be cause shits in real life do be having the exact same cringe ass paterns like these people are literally employed and paid a salary to write a bunch of garbage without even knowing wtf is what being all like omg crypto is hot rn everybody talking about it rn thats the next big thing is it tho like erybody talking about cryptography u for fucking real WTF like these people wouldnt even know how to set up a pgp key pair ssh key pair encrypting their data LUKS is in like every single linux distro in existence by default by these like selfproclaimed crypto experts having a salary writting a bunch of bs i mean standards is not like u should be some next level cryptography PHD Sarang Surae Noether but we be end users thats the bases and am some retarded ass bitch so its really not like the standards are that high anyways that shit just really pissing me off and i know it shouldnt cause like said we all know its just a bunch of fake ass bs anyways but still and more recently the whole reuters omg the criminals be using binance oh no whatwegonnado well how about they delist xmr there as been so much fud about oh no xmr is getting delisted but it SHOULD get delisted like sure itll be replaced by some more fud woah am too retarded to figure how to buy the monero its just sooooooo hard kycless fixedfloat swaps and anything on kycnotme is just for the over 9000 IQ people but on the long run getting rid of all those centralized shady exchanges would just be so much beneficial for the whole thing kinda insane being seen as some crazy ass tinfoil just by stating that the role of an exchange is just to match a buyer with a seller and a seller with a buyer not to act as a bank lying about how many they actually have in reserve because they just faking volumes creating fake trades on their own offchain platform acting as both sellers and buyers to manipulate the market hence why they do not have the amounts they should have at all times anyways thanks for coming to my ted talk dont mind leaving your too long didnt read downvote away cause reddit is yet an other garbage ass platform as well like fuck did u know that since crypto is so hot rn that erybody is jumping on the hype train reddit cofounder even made their own token called something like apeshit token or somethin cryptography to the fucking moon yall o and from the bottom of my heart my most genuine thanks to the contributors of the monero ecosystem aiming at those same goals of building something actually good and useful for the regular joes and janes regardless of adversity and whatnot

peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

possible way not your keys not your coins Requirements x200B 1 1 USB Drive 8GB 2 A computer with Internet Access 3 Make sure your computer is able to Boot USB Drives How to Create a Monero Paper Wallet x200B Go to Scroll down and click on Get Tails 51 and follow the Instructions for your Operating System After you have downloaded the Tails Image and verified it write the Image to your 8GB USB Drive according to the Instructions of you operating system BE SURE YOU HAVE VERIFIED THE IMAGE BEFORE WRITING TO YOUR USB DRIVE Shut down your computer and plug in your USB then go in to your Boot Menu Boot Menu Guide After you have successfully booted your USB you should see a screen like this You can leave everything default just click Start Tails Now that you are at the blue screen Home Screen go the search bar using WindowsSuper key and type in Configure Persistent Volume and click on the vault From here type in a password or passphrase you will memorize x200B On the select menu scroll down and uncheck Additional Software and leave Personal Data on x200B Then click Save and Restart Now After you have restarted be sure to go back in to your Boot Menu and boot into your Tails USB Now that you are at the Home Screen again you should see your Encrypted Persistent Storage Menu enter the passphrase you created and unlock it Now Start Tails once again Then connect to WiFi or Ethernet using settings Once you are connected to the Internet a portal should show up Select Connect to Tor automatically easier and click on Connect to Tor After that you should see a loading screen showing your Internet connecting to Tor if you get an error connecting to Tor while using bridges simply click on Fix Clock and type in your Time Zone Give it a few seconds and it should show Connected to Tor successfully Click on Start Tor Browser a pop up of Tails information will show up you can just ignore it Open a New Tab Then go to Monero Paper Wallet GitHub Click on the green button Code then Download ZIP SAVE THE ZIP FILE INTO PERSISTENT Tor Browser ON TAILS Tor Browser Persistent After the download is finished and you have saved the ZIP File into your Tor Browser Persistent folder RESTART your Tails After you have restarted be sure to go back in to your Boot Menu and boot into your Tails USB You should be back at the home screen once again This time click on the on the Additional Settings tab Then tap on Offline Mode You should then see the menu Select Disable all networking and click Add This setting disables all networking including WiFi Bluetooth and Ethernet Also unlock your Persistent Storage and Start Tails Now go to Files Tor Browser Persistent and extract the ZIP File if you havent Open the extracted ZIP File and double click on monerowalletgeneratorhtml There will be a pop up saying Tor is not ready Start Tor Browser anyway This is exactly what we want Tap on Start Tor Browser Offline When the Tor Browser has loaded up you should now see the Offline Wallet Generator If you notice the keys are stuck on Generating just refresh the page NOW YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR NEW MONERO WALLET AND ITS KEYS Your paper wallet will have four important items generated Monero Public Address The public address is used to receive funds to the wallet You give this to anyone who will be sending funds to your wallet Monero Mnemonic Seed The mnemonic seed is a method of storing the entire wallet that is easily recognizable to humans This is all you need to restore your wallet at a later date Monero Spend Key The private spend key is used to send funds from the wallet Monero View Key The private view key is to view transactions entering the wallet Commonly this is used to setup a viewonly wallet which can see incoming transactions live on the blockchain as they are sent to a cold storage wallet From here on you can print it using an offline printer some people go as far as destroying their printer or never using it again Just make sure it is not saved on the printers memory The most important part is writing down your mnemonic seed on paper and store any copy of your informationkeys SECURELY After you have written down printed or copied your Monero information you can close the Tor Browser and then you can wipe the ZIP File and the monerowalletfolder by right clicking on them and clicking Wipe if you do not plan on using it again as you will no longer need it You can also delete the Persistent Volume by 1 Restarting Tails from the USB stick on which you want to delete the Persistent Storage In the Welcome Screen keep the Persistent Storage locked without entering your password 2 Start Tails 3 SuperWindows Key Type in Delete Persistent Volume Delete persistent volume vault 4 Click Delete Shut down the computer and remove the USB Since the wallet was downloaded with Tor and accessed only offline it adds a level of anonymity to your Monero wallet YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE PICTURES OR SHARE YOUR MNEMONIC SEED TO ANYONE YOU DONT WANT TO GIVE YOUR FUNDS TO To verify funds have arrived to your fresh Monero Public Address you can create a ViewOnly wallet ViewOnly wallets are relatively safe on your main operating system connected to the Internet since they only use your Public Address and your ViewOnly key If worse case scenario you are infected with malware on your computer they can not steal your funds as they do not have the seed nor the spend key I also recommend downloading the entire Monero blockchain for more security If you would like to donate my Monero address is

peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from

is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I

balance to unlock Your balance is unlocked after 10 confirmations which means 10 mined blocks A block is mined approximately every two minutes on the Monero network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I

balance to unlock Your balance is unlocked after 10 confirmations which means 10 mined blocks A block is mined approximately every two minutes on the Monero network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I

that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

decentralized money A refugees account of the dictatorship in Syria in defense of decentralized money Did you know that to send money from abroad to Syria an individual loses more than 40 with the exchange difference alone and that this is probably intentional by the Syrian State Check out this exclusive account of a refugee in Brazil who recounted his experience in the Arab Spring protests during the rise of the current dictator in the country And understand why decentralized money is so important TLDR For many of us cryptos are just a tool for investment and financial speculation but for others they are a real and efficient way to transfer money without the need for intermediaries corrupted by central institutions of great strength such as the Central Bank of a dictatorial government which robs its citizens to supposedly finance weapons that will be used against the very victims of the theft It is further evidence that we need to work to encourage the adoption of these decentralized currencies creating safe routes and alternatives for the use of money which is nothing more than a tool to optimize voluntary exchanges Introduction While returning from a trip on Sunday August 7th I had the pleasure of meeting a Syrian refugee who has been living in Brazil for eight years after fleeing the dictatorial regime in his country of origin In this report originally published in Cointimes in portuguese I will explain what happened and bring arguments in favor of freedom and individual sovereignty in addition to defending the use of decentralized peertopeer money as one of the means for both freedom and sovereignty to be possible in the face of an aggressor state An unusual encounter and a historical account A conversation that started with my curiosity about how to make the real Arabic tabbouleh with my new friend explaining the traditional recipe which I intend to put into practice later this week escalated to the reasons that brought him to Brazil followed by a personal account who filled me with hate and sadness when I got to know another side of history by someone who lived and saw a lot happen with their own eyes I intend to tell you a little of what was told to me in the three hours of travel with my Syrian friend whose name and some other personal information I will keep secret In this material I will bring some historical data for contextualization but mainly the personal account of my temporary road companion Some information I was able to verify from other sources but much of what will be reported cannot be verified as the countrys current government has been working for years to control the narrative manipulate the facts and even censor what the world knows about the Arab reality He told me that he has already given a lecture on the subject facing questions such as but is it true I do not mean to question what cannot be verified The aim here is to give a voice to an individual who has suffered at the hands of a tyrannical government and leave the questioning to yourself the reader Embark with me on this journey that will cross the Atlantic Ocean go around the coastal region of Africa and Europe entering the Mediterranean Sea to the country known as Syria  Historical context about Syria  Syria is a country located in Western Asia part of the region known worldwide as the Middle East southeast of Turkey and northeast of Egypt and Israel west of Iraq having been part of the Ottoman Empire one of the greatest empires in human history Its capital Damascus is among one of the oldest civilizations in the world as an inhabited city It is currently very difficult to estimate the size of the Syrian population because of the war but according to Wikipedia this number is around 22 million Speaking of war in March 2011 a civil war broke out between multiple sides with the then president Bashar alAssad leader of the current government called the Syrian Arab Republic in control of the largest war force and the national army The civil war was initially marked by a series of protests against the current government that formed part of the Arab Spring which began in Tunisia and spread to other countries in reaction to cases of corruption in the government of Bashar alAssad and an economic crisis that was beginning to take shape in Syria And this is where the report I had contact on August 7 2022 begins Protests infiltrators and deaths Our Sirian friend at that time was studying at the university And it was in the universities as is often the case where dissatisfaction with alAssads corruption began to take shape He told me that over time older students began to appear in his classes who claimed to have been transferred from other universities or were older professionals who wanted to reenter the market at a time when unemployment began to grow due to the economic crisis Over time the students discovered that these people were in fact members of the secret police infiltrating universities to discover plans for the protests before they took place as well as trying to persuade university students in favor of the government Part of these discoveries occurred according to reports due to the sheer arrogance of these infiltrators who at some point used their position in a selfaffirming way to gain popularity among students Admitting to being members of Bashar alAssads army and secret police The response to the Arab Spring protests began to become extremely violent and our Sirian friend told us that several times he fled the police through the streets under hail of gunpowder for which many of his own friends and university colleagues were hit and killed in public highway The UN estimates that more than 300000 civilians were killed in 10 years of civil war in the country but there is a very high chance that this number is tremendously higher as there are estimates from other sources that calculate between 400000 and 600000 dead Not to mention the missing ones The police shots were justified as a response to the protesters also using firearms but according to the personal report the shots coming from the side of the protesters were authored by more infiltrated actors from the secret police who shot at the police and soldiers of the regime These actors were unmasked countless times by the students as said To arrange the meetings the university students used closed Facebook groups since as he told me technological knowledge is very precarious even among the army and the secret police who thought that Facebook was a device and not an application In this way they were able to share maps with location and orientation for the protests including safe escape routes and they had about a minute and a half from the start of the protests to their stampede to avoid deaths and arrests Mandatory military service and the flight to Brazil It is a historical and wellknown fact under numerous complaints from NGOs around the world that the Bashar government was responsible for hundreds of human rights abuses involving kidnapping torture and execution of opposing civilians According to historical data and also as reported during my trip military service in Syria is mandatory Every man upon turning 18 has to enlist and serve in the army during the civil war Its only possible to escape the obligation if go to study in higher education graduate studies or by paying a fine of 8000 but in the latter case at the risk of being branded as a political enemy of the dictator As I learned in our conversation the recruits passed several tests of loyalty to the state and were forced to torture and execute political prisoners If any soldier refused to obey orders they themselves were executed and made national heroes with their families being told that they died with honor in the war defending their country To escape the decision between taking the life of an innocent person or losing his own our friend Srio entered graduate school in a course that was not even related to his training Upon graduation with no other options he fled to Brazil in 2014 where he remains to this day His brothers did the same one going to Germany and the other to Turkey Escape however is not easy as the Syrian passport is one of the least accepted in the world and requires authorization from the federal government of the destination country in the form of a refugee visa Talking about entering a new country I discovered that the visa is only granted after a thorough investigation involving INTERPOL International Police of which ironically the Government of Syria is a member There are reports of protesters and government opponents who are branded by the Syrian State in INTERPOL as terrorists members of organizations such as ISIS and in this way are prevented from taking refuge in other member countries of the International Police Many of these end up trapped in hostile territory or forced to join the terrorist groups they were accused of being a part of in order to gain protection There are even reports that Bashar alAssads own government is allied with these terrorist groups from which he claims to be defending his population and most of the conflicts between these groups and the Syrian Arab Republic are nothing more than staged for maintain the State of Siege and martial laws in the country But these facts unfortunately I could not verify Economic situation and exchange rate in Syria In addition to his two brothers who are also refugees the Syrian told me that he has a mother and a 75yearold father who are still in territory dominated by the tyrant His father refuses to leave the country out of attachment to his nation and the life he built there during all his seven and a half decades His father is retired receiving around 330000 SYP 80 USD per month in Syrias public pension program With such a low monthly income the brothers decided to help their parents financially by sending money from Brazil Germany and Turkey to Syria but they ran into a serious problem More than 40 is lost when sending money to Syria As he himself informed me what happens in the Syrian Pound SYP exchange market is a manipulation originating from the Central Bank influencing private banks which trade the SYPUSD with a spread of about 40 I checked this information and this is exactly what happens when trying to send dollar USD which will be converted to Syrian pound SYP by remittance financial institutions Looking at the 1 quote on remittance platforms and banks operating outside Syria we have a quote of 2500 SYP While the 1 USD quote is at 4200 SYP domestically If for example our Syrian friend sends US 10000 to his father through conventional means authorized by the government of Bashar alAssad the father would receive about 250000 SYP But if the destination received the same amount directly in dollars by other unconventional means and prohibited by the Central Bank of Syria it would have the equivalent of about 420000 SYP The difference of 170000 SYP 40 is lost in the halfway Where does that money go You must have wondered where that money goes I asked the same thing According to the personal account the difference or spread is absorbed by the Central Bank to finance the government and the war against citizens Unfortunately this is another point that would be impossible to confirm in the face of a totalitarian state with censorship of information but it would be something very likely to happen in a country ruled by martial law in extreme conditions under constant armed conflicts Furthermore by making international remittances expensive alAssad manages to make it difficult for groups opposed to his government to finance making it difficult to raise funds to arm defenders enable refugees to flee or feed the population that is totally dependent on governments goodwill to provide all the necessary resources for life For those who wonder why not send the dollar directly still as reported it is forbidden for any citizen to carry more than 10000 Its a crime punishable by imprisonment I was able to partially confirm this information through the official website of the United Kingdom where they communicate the warning of severe punishments for the use of the dollar in Syria Cryptocurrencies may offer a fairer alternative to money remittances As most of you know in addition to being a writer analyst and researcher at Cointimes I am also a volunteer engaged in the Nano XNO community During our conversation I asked the Syrian if he had ever considered using cryptocurrencies to send money to his family thus avoiding massive losses of almost half of the amount sent in addition to funding the aggressor government he fled from He himself had not considered this alternative and part of this is due to the lack of information about the possibility of using decentralized currencies for the purpose of international remittances He also asked me about sending fees which were high on Bitcoin BTC and conversion fees to local currency The bitcoin network is currently at historically very low fees at around 150 USD per transaction but in April 2021 we saw average fees in excess of 6000 during a high demand for the industryleading blockchain Even so the average rates during this year would represent a value much lower than what is lost with the alleged corruption of the Central Bank when using conventional means in addition to allowing a sovereign and peertopeer remittance I explained that there are other decentralized and secure currencies with advantages and disadvantages in relation to bitcoin that could be used for financial remittances including explaining my work with nano and how I believe personal opinion that it is the most efficient way to send or receive money around the world especially as it has no transaction fees and is confirmed in less than a second reducing potential losses along the way In addition I am searching in the nano community to understand if we can in some way help with the exchange or so that this money can be used directly there I found that Turkey is a very easy country to convert cryptocurrencies by Turkish Lira TRY with Binance being one of the main platforms in the country Through TRY it would be possible to convert to SYP in the sequence avoiding the loss of remittances with USD creating a kind of money corridor Binance currently charges around 01 for peer exchange plus a 15 fee for TRY withdrawals and deposits A total of 16 to 17 in case of two exchanges XNO USDT TRY Much cheaper than the fees charged for traditional services This is just one more example of the importance of Bitcoin BTC and the entire ecosystem that its invention allowed to have been built in the last decade For many of us cryptos are just a tool for investment and financial speculation but for others they are a real and efficient way to transfer money without the need for intermediaries corrupted by central institutions of great strength such as the Central Bank of a dictatorial government which robs its citizens to supposedly finance weapons that will be used against the very victims of the theft It is further evidence that we need to work to encourage the adoption of these decentralized currencies creating safe routes and alternatives for the use of money which is nothing more than a tool to optimize voluntary exchanges In case you know anyone from any crypto community Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Monero Dash XRP Nano etc that could help with information on the best way to send and receive money to Syria please comment here Privacy cryptocurrencies like Monero could make a great case here as well Maybe even more if trying to send money directly to Syria and protecting all the parties involved in it

balance to unlock Your balance is unlocked after 10 confirmations which means 10 mined blocks A block is mined approximately every two minutes on the Monero network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I

balance to unlock Your balance is unlocked after 10 confirmations which means 10 mined blocks A block is mined approximately every two minutes on the Monero network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I

How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To restore your wallet with your keys please see this guide 3 Wallet Ledger How do I

balance to unlock Your balance is unlocked after 10 confirmations which means 10 mined blocks A block is mined approximately every two minutes on the Monero network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

on some of the more common convenient centralized noKYC exchangers used by the community to see which ones give the best realworld results speed feesrate privacy My desire for the test was sparked by the drama surrounding the Majestic Bank exchanger I will add an onion link to Pariss post when Dread is back up and to compare the alternatives Obviously for the best privacy options like Haveno LocalMonero and atomic swaps are great but thats not the focus of this test Some great options are still being developed and users new to Monero are more likely to use instant swappers than LocalMonero but you should definitely consider LocalMonero Im going to run the test again in the near future and if you would like any services added to the list or for me to change any part of the test please comment or message me THE TEST The goal was to provide realworld numbers to hold swap services accountable and allow us the users to be able to actually compare them instead of relying on the claims on their websites The test was done by sending the same small amount BTC to each exchanger at roughly the same time and comparing the results Amount Received was calculated using the actual XMR that arrived in end wallet as a percentage based on the BTCXMR rate listed on an arbitrary platform at the time of the BTC send This was chosen to provide a common baseline but it should be taken with a grain of salt Percentages should be compared only to each other in the table and do not necessarily reflect the real returns you will receive when using these services since you may be using a different source for your BTCXMR rate Total Time was calculated from the time of the first BTC confirmation to the first XMR confirmation in my final wallet including withdraws if applicable Privacy was limited to its Toraccessibility and JavaScriptfriendliness although I know there are many other considerations If a service did not function reliably or did not allow all features eg limiting the types or amounts of swaps when using Tor it was labeled as Torhostile If it has a Tor hidden service it was labeled with Onion If it required JavaScript to function this was also noted RESULTS

minutesOnion JS not required Infinity19356 minutes5Onion JS not required Incognito29996 1 hour7Mobile app TradeOgre399527 minutesTorhostile JS required Majestic Bank4INCOMPLETEINCOMPLETEOnion JS not required CONCLUSIONS Make your own conclusions But here are some of mine The Tor hidden service instant swappers had about a 34 decrease in returns compared to the clear web instant swappers I knew it was more costly but I did not realize just how much until putting the numbers on paper It is also worth noting that you are more likely to get tainted coins if going XMR using Infinity than ChangeNow for example but you have the benefit of using an onion site I was pleasantly surprised at the speed of all instant swappers ChangeNow is slightly more expensive than FixedFloat and SideShift which seems to have been historically true TradeOgre has good returns when going from BTC XMR due to its low fees so long as you can wait for the required deposit confirmations and withdraw delay Incognito is nice but fits a very different niche than the occasional instant swap I am disappointed that Majestic Bank was down Since their scandal I wanted them included on this test to see if they were really backreliable At the time of writing it looks like they are back up on Tor so hopefully they will be included next test Infinity the somewhat new kid on the block seems to have fees similar to KiloSwap and were just as fast FUTURE TESTS I will run this test again likely going the other direction XMR BTC and will likely include more services If you have exchangers youd like me to include please comment or DM me Ones Im considering if theres interest are Elude onion retrying Majestic Bank maybe some other instant swappers and maybe the Cake Wallet version of ChangeNow or SideShift Obviously there are some costs associated with running these tests swap fees blockchain transaction fees and withdraw fees for CEXsDEXs If you want to help me out for this test and future tests I welcome any XMR assistance here x200B 83cr1a9KBYuTsQvDDL1STw8ozoU16SZSTcSdRXuimdp89KvhqLoxonaFfEzccYQnjKNJwFmmWuGFWdecCKtDHdTtL2po5hX This address expires at the end of 2022 x200B Footnotes 1 Due to an issue with the initial transaction user error Infinitys swap did not go through at the same time as the rest Still its low returns could not be accounted for by the small change in price that occurred in that time 2 Incognito is a DEX that requires a lengthy deposit shield and withdraw unshield process 3 Swapping on TradeOgre means depositing waiting for the deposit to confirm swapping and then withdrawing This time delay leads to price fluctuations which can taint results Still even taking that into account the returns were very good 4 Majestic Bank was excluded because the onion site was down at the time of the test right in keeping with all the issues surrounding it recently 5 Remember the Infinity BTC transaction went through at a different time so the faster speed was likely just due to a difference in block times 6 The results here are due primarily to the pricerate on Incognito at the time of the test as opposed to fees The rate of BTC to XMR on Incognito varies from CEXs and it can change rapidly due to low liquidity Just because the results were good on this test does not mean they will always be good 7 The Total Time is long because of the shieldunshield process of Incognito

that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

indepth article that covers the basics without getting into the weeds Id appreciate it if the Monero community could review it and suggest any improvements Is something unclear Did I get something wrong Ive tried to keep it to things I have tested or used myself as much as possible What I really would like help with is fleshing out the other resources section Make sure to recommend anything you think will be useful that I might have missed Thanks WHAT CRYPTOCURRENCY SHOULD YOU USE Cryptocurrencies are distinct from fiat money US Dollars Pounds Euro etc in that they are decentralised with individual miners not centralised private banks keeping a tab on all transactions If you are in any way familiar with cryptocurrencies you have probably come across Bitcoin Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is currently the most valuable You should know that Bitcoin has a host of problems the most prominent being its security vulnerabilities due to its lack of privacy Anyone can see how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet and trace all of your transactions In short Bitcoin is surveillance money and a cryptocurrency you should largely ignore For a comprehensive breakdown of Bitcoin and its problems please see this article we compiled The only cryptocurrency that currently exclusively operates like decentralised digital cash is Monero XMR The benefits of Monero include Endtoend encrypted transactions fully private Low processing fees Fast transactions Easy integration options Cleaver antiinflation algorithm Antipaytowin mining algorithm Helpful community The uses of Monero include Persontoperson transactions no middle man bank you become your own Cancel culturepersecution proof as long as there is internet and computers you can use Monero Inflation proof Can be used to store wealth and protect your assets from inflation Sometimes to see the quality of something you need to only look at its enemies Monero is the only cryptocurrency 3 letter agencies fear and are even paying to crack It is also delisted from many exchanges This signifies its strengths against those who currently hold power These strengths sadly attract nefarious users who seek to hide the transactions of their crimes Criminals using something should not stop anyone from embracing a tool or technology That would be like refusing to use a car because criminals also use cars To learn more about Monero see the official website and read the free book Mastering Monero HOW TO SET UP YOUR WALLET When it comes to managing Monero there are two paths to go down Less technically complex and more technically complex For starting off I suggest moving forward with a less technically complicated solution however both will be outlined here Less Technically Complex Cake Wallet Easy to use Quick setup Mobile app Compatible with Unstoppable Domains humanreadable addresses Less private No desktop option No builtin mining options Setting Up Your Cake Wallet Cake Wallet is an opensource no hidden code in its framework noncustodial wallet this means you own your private keys and therefore have complete control over the cryptocurrency within your wallet In contrast custodial wallets act like your fiat bank account a private business holds your assets on your behalf but they control the lock and key For more information on the different types of crypto wallets see this resource When first installing your Cake Wallet on your phone make sure to back up your recovery codes private seed preferably printing them out and keeping them in a physical safe Think of this master code as your permanent address while the wallet address is like your PO box The private seed is what you will use to restore your wallet and access your Monero on the blockchain This is your Monero and if someone was to access this they would have the master key to your safe Download Cake Wallet More Technically Complex Moneros Official GUI Wallet Greater security Builtin mining options Lengthy setup Desktop only Incompatible with Unstoppable Domains humanreadable addresses Setting Up Your Monero GUI Wallet The GUI wallet is officially designed by the Monero community and is your solution for storing large amounts of Monero Think of it like your bank for your savings while Cake Wallet will act as a wallet for daytoday purchases The GUI wallet is very secure and strengthens the Monero network You will need about 150 GB of space on your hard drive however to run this application as the wallet downloads the entire ledger helping to keep Monero decentralised Before you install the GUI software you will want to verify that your download is authenticlegitimate This is a very important step that should not be skipped If this is going to be your bank you want to make absolutely sure you have downloaded and installed software that the Monero developers intended you to download not a Trojan program pretending to be legitimate so bad actors can steal your XMR Follow this stepbystep guide for Windows to validate your Monero GUI installer download You can download the Monero GUI Wallet installer files here NOTE You will want to create a new folder that will hold the binaryfateasc file the hashestxt file and your exe download Create an exception in Windows your antivirus to this folder as the zip will most likely be flagged as suspicious To do this hit the Windows key type Virus threat protection tap manage and navigate to Exceptions and create an exception folder if you are using an antivirus tap open app instead of manage to do this within that software Once your download has been validated install the GUI wallet and see this official guide to configure the app For the highest security make sure to keep this application up to date HOW TO BUY CRYPTO One reason why I recommend Cake Wallet is that you can easily purchase Monero within the wallet itself This is the most convenient way to obtain Monero however you might be able to find a better deal elsewhere To purchase Monero within Cake Wallet you will need to 1 Create a Bitcoin wallet within Cake Wallet 2 Purchase Bitcoin within Cake Wallet tap the buy button in your BTC wallet 3 Exchange your Bitcoin for Monero It can take about 2040 minutes for Bitcoin transactions to be confirmed so you will want to account for this before starting In terms of getting the best price for Monero I have not been able to get XMR cheaper than by using a Limit Spot order on Binance This does require more time and effort to set up it also requires you to verify your ID and hand over your most sensitive information to a middleman exchange For those based in the USA and who cant access Binance Kraken is an exchange that sells Monero I would ultimately suggest you buy directly from a seller and remove the need for a middleman exchange altogether Exchanges require you to hand over your most sensitive private information by confirming your ID which is not ideal while also charging you additional fees Never keep your crypto on an exchange as they are custodial always immediately transfer your purchased crypto to your noncustodial wallet Buying Monero directly from sellers without the need of an exchange can be done through Local Monero I have not personally done this yet but this would be my next step should I want to purchase more Monero Make sure you purchase from a user that has many positive reviews and is trustworthy I would recommend using PayPal for your first purchase so you have a backup should something go wrong HOW TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS DONATIONS Perhaps you want to receive donations you only need to include your receive address on your website so that someone can copy and paste it into their wallet to send you Monero Alternatively you can include a QR code to your address on your site so that it can be scanned without the need to copy and paste As a way of an example here is the TheoNerds Monero Receive Address 44VRRc2PLsvSBD24zwoMAxPfr9WRsN6sWU1XeddydZJbgi6PxNYG6EdFVJJGmxetrWKTdVyN68VmHNnUu4Aw6fsCPaQm6GL or type this URL in the Cake Wallet address field Theonerdswallet Cake Wallet has the added benefit of being compatible with Unstoppable Domains which will allow you to purchase a humanreadable domain theonerdswallet and connect it to your Monero address This domain will only work on selected wallets that are compatible with this functionality Cake Wallet and Guarda Wallet being some of them If you run an online shop and are selling something on your website that needs to confirm a Monero payment before dispatching a product or service then I would recommend these three options 1 Monero Integrations works with WooCommerce 2 Now Payments works with Shopify 3 BTC Pay HOW TO MINE CRYPTO Mining Monero will require the latest version of the GUI Wallet so make sure to go back to this step and install it before continuing Mining Monero has several advantages 1 It helps verify transactions on the Monero blockchain strengthening the infrastructure 2 You are rewarded with Monero directly to your GUI wallet 3 You dont need expensive hardware to be awarded I highly recommend using the P2Pool mining integration within the GUI Wallet This prevents any one private pool from holding a monopoly on validating Monero transactions which was a threat at one time and there are no payout fees Follow this simple video tutorial to get started Also visit p2poolio for more information NOTE It can take several days to a week to find a share and receive a payout if your hashrate is low Use the P2Pool Observer to check your current status USEFUL RESOURCES Monero Community Reddit Monero Community Monero Space Monero Guides By Seth For Privacy 101 Things Monero Can Buy

balance to unlock Your balance is unlocked after 10 confirmations which means 10 mined blocks A block is mined approximately every two minutes on the Monero network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

letter and proposal Hi Monero community This is an open letter to all the participants want to make Monero ecosystem strong and pleasant I am open source developer known for many years at bitcointalkorg as floridahaunted First time I remember I was discussing there is in year 2011 Mainly I was arguing about Bitcoin disadvantages and searching for a currency much more perfect I found that currency Monero Fungible untraceable tiny fees adaptive block size tail emission ASICresistant decentralized p2pool mining I have decided to dedicate my small developing efforts to Monero community Particularly I thought on p2pool and its practical application problems a lot Indeed p2pool is fully implemented and working in production for more than ONE year But its total hashrate is still under 199MHs most of the time And we all remember the history with epic MineXMRcom pool and its departure few months ago MineXMRcom was an oldschool centralized pool that was occupying nearly 51 of total Monero network hashrate There were a lot of discussions on reddit how danger was that situation for Monero network security So MineXMRcom has departed And it is important MineXMRcom did recommend for all the miners to migrate to decentralized p2pool I thought at least half of MineXMRcom hashrate should be switched to p2pool thus increasing its hashrate up to some 500MHs But almost nothing happens Look at miningpoolstatsstreammonero every single day What figure do you observe Top 3 pools are CENTRALIZED and occupying some 70 of total network hashrate Decentralized p2pool with mini is occupying just 7 of total network hashrate Most time nanopoolorg is top 1 We all have questions to nanopoolorg right The community have to accept the truth to build update and maintain their OWN p2pool instance is NOT an ease task for MOST Monero miners And it is nearly impossible to deploy their own p2pool instance for all the newbies Then what is a typical enter step for a newbie Yes to join 1 of top 3 centralized mining pools Looking at that sad figure I have implemented deployed and maintain brand new MineXMR2com pool MineXMR2com is not related to the departed MineXMRcom pool in any way And I am completely separated person from MineXMRcom owner I called the pool MineXMR2com because I was inspired of oldschool fashion of MineXMRcom pool for a long time and digit 2 also hints to decentralized p2pool inside MineXMR2com pool Below there are features and benefits of MineXMR2com pool I could formulate in a nutshell MineXMR2com is the first 100 OPEN SOURCE Monero mining pool using decentralized p2pool as a hashrateliquidity provider All the hashrate of your miners is being redirected completely to an embedded p2pool instance Thus if MineXMR2com occupies 51 of network hashrate it means actually decentralized p2pool does occupy 51 of network hashrate MineXMR2com remains an oldschool Monero pool no registration even email no spying cookies no personal data collection Once you find few shares your XMR address is registered in internal database lmdb and is getting paid automatically MineXMR2com has its own billing system You dont need to find a share on p2pool or a block on the network to get paid by MineXMR2com The pool is recording your shares separately thus even a miner with small hashrate can see how his pending balance is being updated each time the whole decentralized p2pool with its typical 150MHs hashrate finds a new block That happens few times per hour statistically Payment threshold is as low as 001XMR In worst case scenario you cant lose more than 001XMR with MineXMR2com pool And of course you can email to support minexmr2tutanotacom to get paid manually MineXMR2com completely eliminates dust payments 00003XMR from p2pool that typically occur for miners with small hashrate You always receive 001XMR chunks Unlike paid with dust from p2pool when you spend your mined XMR you obtain typical tiny Monero transaction fees 000005XMR not huge transaction fees form dust payments Exciting There is one question how to prove MineXMR2com is actually running OPEN SOURCE code it claims There are some approaches 1 You can monitor stratum protocol output from MineXMR2com and compare it with output from your local p2pool instance 2 When MineXMR2com hashrate reaches some 1530MHs or more you can plot correlation charts of MineXMR2com hashrate against official p2pool hashrate 3 With your aid I can implement deterministic build practices for source code from reproduciblebuildsorg No one of that approaches is perfect but combining them we can reach a good level of proof MineXMR2com is indeed running open source And remember no other centralized pool offers such a possibility to his users Hereby I ask the community to support MineXMR2com pool I may create a CCS proposal or simply if MineXMR2com hashrate reaches some 100MHs or more it will be an autoproposal for me I plan to implement many useful features for miners Graphical hashrate charts per miners XMR address Graphical hashrate chart for the whole MineXMR2com pool p2pool and network Email notifications on whether particular miner rig is online or offline Any feature of your desire feel free to create GitHubGitLab issue Join MineXMR2com pool Sincerely yours floridahauntedgmailcom

Reporting of ALL Trades and Transactions Soon Mandatory Shocking New Rules by OECD Due Diligence The WAR on Crypto Privacy Intensifies Automatic Reporting of ALL Trades and Transactions Soon Mandatory Massive overreach of international regulators to force all service providers in the industry to x200B Record ALL crypto trades on exchanges DEFI and DEXs Record large purchases from private wallets Record all transfers to cold storage and make lists with private wallet addresses Send all this info annually to the tax authorities And finally the G20 forces governments to pass these rules into domestic law The war on privacy continues The aim to tackle anonymous spending and exchanging of crypto As youll discover these new regulations force upon us a system of complete surveillance and control This report explains exactly what to expect from the latest developments launched in October 2022 x200B Disclaimer Given that this post is based on new international standards that have not yet been implemented in national legislation and US proposed legislation non of this information can be considered legal or financial advice x200B What is Going On Last year the crypto world was shaken to its core when the Financial Action Task Force FATF acting in behalf of the G20 released their guidance on virtual assets1 This document laid out a set of rules regarding stablecoins distinctions between private and hosted wallets extensive KYC requirements the tackling of privacy tools and more2 FATF has also provided a final definition of the type of service provider tasked with reporting on crypto the Virtual Asset Service Provider or VASP Fast forward to today and these rules are quickly being implemented across the world3 But as usual it didnt stop there Another international regulator the OECD is already building on this framework in an attempt to massively increase the grip of authorities on what happens in the industry What is the OECD The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD is a Parisbased international organisation that works to build better policies for better lives Its goal is to shape policies that foster prosperity equality opportunity and wellbeing for all4 Together with governments policy makers and citizens the OECD works on finding solutions to a range of social economic and environmental challenges From improving economic performance and creating jobs to fostering strong education and fighting international tax evasion The organisation provides a unique forum and knowledge hub within which to discuss and develop public policies and international standard setting5 This international standard setting is what we will look at next Automated Exchange of Financial Information with Authorities Since 2014 In 2014 the OECD published the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters6 This publication created a Common Reporting Standard CRS which forces financial institutions to automatically exchange account information with the authorities of the country of residence of their account holders The goal to prevent persons from holding financial accounts in offshore jurisdictions and not reporting them back home This is why all financial service providers request utility bills they prove where you live and hence where they have to report to All financial institutions that are currently subjected to these regulations are forced to automatically report to the authorities the name address Tax Identification Numbers date and place of birth the account number and the account value as of the end of the relevant calendar year or other appropriate reporting period7 Now there is no more hiding of accounts held with a foreign financial institutions The authorities enlisted all financial institutions as involuntary but powerful assistants in collecting facts and evidence needed for tax compliance The Panama Papers Just in Time to Boost Worldwide Implementation of Automated Reporting After publishing their standards in 2014 the OECD needed to get countries and their financial institutions in line By August 2015 the OECD had released the first version of a CRS Implementation Handbook8 It provided practical guidance to assist government officials and financial institutions in implementing CRS But while the standards set by the OECD came into force in 2016 in earlyadopting states by March of 2016 these standards were still far from being fully integrated into the global financial system9 This was especially true in the offshore jurisdictions that were the main target What was needed was a shift in conscience On April 3rd 2016 the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published a giant leak of offshore financial records better known as the Panama Papers10 These revelations caused public outrage The G5 the five largest Western European countries were quick to jump on the bandwagon and call for more international cooperation to tackle tax dodging and illicit finance11 The message did not fall on deaf ears the next day on April 15th G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors met in Washington and issued the following Communiqu we call on all relevant countries including all financial centers and jurisdictions which have not committed to implement the standard on automatic exchange of information by 2017 or 2018 to do so without delay and to sign the Multilateral Convention We expect that by the 2017 G20 Summit all countries and jurisdictions will upgrade their Global Forum rating to a satisfactory level We mandate the OECD working with G20 countries to establish objective criteria by our July meeting to identify noncooperative jurisdictions with respect to tax transparency Defensive measures will be considered by G20 members against noncooperative jurisdictions if progress as assessed by the Global Forum is not made12 Thus within 12 days of the publication of the Panama Papers the worlds 20 most powerful governments had collectively agreed to start pushing CRS reporting requirements aggressively and to punish noncooperative offshore jurisdictionsregardless of their local laws This is how offshore finance was brought into the fold and financial privacy died Why Can the OECD Regulate Financial Institutions Around the World Isnt this a Task of Democracy The OECD isnt a government agency of any individual country As such it cannot create law It issues what is known as soft laws or recommendations and guidance Only when this guidance is transposed into the laws of individual countries does it becomes hard law with real world power In theory this process is subjected to the formal democratic lawmaking processes of the implementing countries However countries that dont participate face restricted access to the financial system and ostracism from the international community For this reason almost all nations are compelled to implement these recommendations It must also be said that national governments especially in the Western world highly value this kind of international cooperation and the control it gives them without the need to deal with the inconveniences of democracy They simply hide behind the fact that these are international standards which they have to follow because everybody does Neither does it help that few of our representatives journalists and fellow citizens seem to understand the impact of these treaties Those in the legal industry who do understand the implications just look at it as business as usual and a new way to generate income As such most standards are passed into domestic law with little opposition or delay International Standards Aim to Supersede National Law Once these treaties are accepted they become part of a body of law called international law which in many cases supersedes national laws Unknown to the general public international law is increasingly being used as a backdoor for passing invasive regulations such as those we are discussing here and establishing a global bureaucracy with real power over our financial lives It is also worth noting that the people working for this Parisbased institution have not been elected their procedures and budget are not subjected to democratic oversight and they are almost impossible to remove from power Like most international organizations their operations fall under the Vienna Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities13 As such they enjoy immunity for their actions taken whilst in office are exempt from administrative burdens such as taxes and fines and enjoy less stringent COVID travel restrictions AUTOMATIC Exchange of Transaction Info For Crypto Last week October 10th the OECD published the CryptoAsset Reporting Framework and Amendments to the Common Reporting Standard14 This applies the tax reporting guidance of the existing CRS to cryptoand makes it FAR more invasive The OECD first published a public consultation version of the document on 22nd March 202215 The deadline for feedback from the public was 29th April 2022 This gave the public just over a month to analyze a 101page document figure out what it meant for them and their clients in multiple jurisdictions and formulate a public statement on company letterhead This is not a sign that the OECD takes public input seriously When comparing the two documents there is no material difference between the public consultation and the final version in the section that matters most the actual rules16 Public consultations give these recommendations the appearance of being widely supported by stakeholders It creates the illusion that the public has a say in the matter It doesnt When you read the questions carefully they only seek feedback on details such as which intermediaries are to be included or excluded which type of NFTs are to be in scope what reporting thresholds there should be and how much time should be reserved for implementation17 Furthermore if you read the commentaries submitted which can be downloaded here most respondents just talk their own book trying to elicit amendments that perhaps exempt them from a specific reporting requirement or trying to get a longer timeframe for implementation In all fairness there were also a number of industry insiders who highlighted the double standards created for the crypto industry and how much of a burden the regulations would represent In the end none of this mattered The regulations have been published and are now the new worldwide standard What Are The New Guidelines for Crypto As was the case with earlier regulations Bitcoin will not be banned Instead the OECD builds on the approach set by FATF to regulate the service providers who facilitate transactions In this instance the OECD developed a new global tax transparency framework which provides for the automatic exchange of tax info on transactions in a standardised manner This is the CryptoAsset Reporting Framework or CARF18 As previously mentioned automatic exchange of information used to contain only the details of the individual and the account value New reporting obligations however apply to all transactions in an account This is a major extension of the reporting obligations that currently exist for noncrypto financial services Reporting of Transactions and their Nature by VASPS The OECD proposes that those providing crypto transaction services for or on behalf of customers are to report under the CARF We are talking here about the reporting entities that are defined by FATF ie Virtual Asset Service Providers or VASPs19 x200B Before we look at the details of the information that is going to be exchanged let us remind ourselves of what a VASP is VASP Virtual asset service provider means any natural or legal person who is not covered elsewhere under the Recommendations and as a business conducts one or more of the following activities or operations for or on behalf of another natural or legal person i exchange between virtual assets and fiat currenciesii exchange between one or more forms of virtual assetsiii transfer of virtual assetsiv safekeeping andor administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over virtual assets andv participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuers offer andor sale of a virtual asset20 x200B As you can see the definition of VASP is so wide that it covers many of projects currently operating in the crypto space According to the OECD reporting obligations also apply to companies facilitating Decentralized Finance and Decentralized Exchanges21 x200B What Kind of Individual Transactions Are to Be Reported What needs to be reported In particular the following three types of transactions x200B Exchanges between Crypto Assets and Fiat Currencies Exchanges between one or more forms of Crypto Assets Transfers of Crypto Assets including Reportable Retail Payment Transactions22 x200B Transactions will be reported by type of Crypto Asset and will distinguish between outward and inward transactions In order to enhance the usability of the data for tax administrations the reporting is to be split out between CryptotoCrypto and Crypto Assettofiat transactions Reporting service providers will also be forced to label transfers eg airdrops income derived from staking or a loan in instances where they have such knowledge23 In short the CARF mandates that information an all trades including the type of coin the amount of coins the market value and what was paid be submitted This info is then aggregated and automatically exchanged24 The goal is to inform the tax authorities of how much you own and what kind of income you generated from your holdings And if that is not enough the OECD allows lawmakers the option to request lists of private wallet addresses of users 25 Reporting of Retail Transactions from Private Wallets On a final note the OECD has come up with a trick to limit the opportunity for crypto users to spend their coins anonymously The CARF also applies to merchant providers facilitating crypto payment for goods or services In such instances the merchant provider is required to treat the customer of their customer as its own customer and report the value of the transaction to the tax authorities of the buyer26 For now this only applies to large purchases of over USD 5000027 x200B What About US Citizens and GreenCard Holders The CRS has been implemented worldwide All developed nations and all international financial centers have been included in the list leaving few of the worlds financial highways untouched28 Surprisingly the United States is not on that list The reason is that the US came up with their own automatic reporting framework even before the OECD did It is called the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or FATCA and requires that foreign financial Institutions and certain other nonfinancial foreign entities report on the foreign assets held by their US account holders29 Up until now FATCA did not directly apply to crypto But the new 2023 budget proposal seeks to amend section 6038Db of the Internal Revenue Code to require reporting for a new third category namely any account that holds digital assets maintained by a foreign digital asset exchange or other foreign digital asset service provider a foreign digital asset account30 There is also another USspecific reporting obligation the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Regarding FBAR FinCEN has issued Notice 20202 stating that it also intends to make reporting foreign virtual currency accounts mandatory31 Moreover US tax payers are already required to report their crypto transactions on their tax returns32 The question is will the United States also implement a CARF like system as in the automatic reporting of all transactions This question remains unanswered for now But President Bidens Executive Order from earlier this year clearly stated that the current administration is committed to these international standards including those commissioned by the G20 and FATF and that the US has a leading role in developing and adopting these international standards on digital assets33 Despite all this it is still unclear what the regulatory landscape in the US will look like Regardless USbased companies with clients in other countries ie most of them will have to implement these policies It is hard to imagine the US government not wanting to have this information for itself especially since the legal framework is largely in place But we will have to wait and see What Will Be the Outcome of These Regulations The outcome of these new international standards will be full transparency towards tax authorities The aim of these standards is to get automatic insight into all your trades even laying the foundation to prevent you from spending coins anonymously with retailers that use a third party payment provider This means in practice that although you can hold coins in your private wallet you cannot easily spend or exchange them anonymously In short no more privacy when you use third party services One might say this will be the death of third party services because accepting online payments is as simple as installing a piece of code on your website and taking the payments yourself But most companies do not have the capacity to run their own payment system and are likely going to require payments through a regulated merchant As long as there isnt a Bitcoin standard meaning accounting and payments regularly done in Bitcoin there will be a need for fiat on and off ramps As such even when you do business in crypto your suppliers or clients are likely to make use of a service provider with reporting obligations As a result expect far more scrutiny on transactions from exchanges but also from the people and businesses you are dealing with in everyday crypto activity Even if you do not need to report on certain transactions they might be forced to do so You might be okay with accepting direct peertopeer transactions but could run into issues later when you are obliged to prove where the payments came from Regulators Are Out of Control The reality is that these regulators are out of our control Without direct democratic mandates or oversight they are flooding the world with regulation Just like totalitarian regimes they effectively force private parties to police each other The service providers forced into unpaid financial surveillance carry the rising compliance costs Obliged to make hard decisions as to whom they can take on as customers they are likely to cut services to those they consider not worth the compliance costs such as small or high risk businesses and people in developing nations The cost of compliance might become so great that at least some of them might want to facilitate transactions only with fullyvetted wallets tied to a digital ID such as the EU is implementing34 New Precedent Centralized Surveillance of Individual Transactions This is a good example of regulations being built on top of one another and raising the bar with each step It should not come as a surprise if at some point regular financial service providers are forced into similar obligations to get in line with these new international standards This step might be taken with the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies currently being developed all around the world35 Door Open to Further Monitoring and Restricting of Payments It is not hard to imagine that once all transactions are transparent more actions can be taken as to which type of payments and type of persons are allowed or not We can see this financial cancel culture already happening around the world36 As a result of all this surveillance it is not only privacy that is at risk right now this starts to touch the very idea of maintaining a payment system where you can freely transact and engage in economic activity Only a massive and radical decentralization movement away from third party service providers can prevent this dystopia Stay tuned for a next report and a roadmap for just that x200B TLDR Governments at the highest level G20 commissioned an organization called the OECD to come up with international tax transparency rules for crypto They are using international law frameworks that supersede national legislation and will demand that every country in the world complies The OECD issued their guidance last week Oct 10 2022 They propose that Virtual Asset Service Providers are to be required to annually report on your trades and transactions to the tax authorities of your country of residence Reporting on transaction information is a major extension of reporting obligations as they exist for regular financial institutions The US might not implement these exact standards but is working on its own framework x200B Sources 1 FATF Updated Guidance for a RiskBased Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers FATF Paris 28 October 2021 2 Thysse W FATF Global

balance to unlock Your balance is unlocked after 10 confirmations which means 10 mined blocks A block is mined approximately every two minutes on the Monero network so that would be around 20 minutes How can I prove that I sent a payment The fastest and most direct way is by using the ExploreMonero blockchain explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from

services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To

explorer You will need to recover the transaction key from your wallet complete guide for GUI CLI How do I buy Monero XMR with Bitcoin BTC There are dozens of exchanges that trade Monero against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies Check out the list on CoinMarketCap and choose the option that suits you best How do I buy Monero XMR with fiat Kraken USD and EUR oldschool decent exchange They might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your XMR How do I restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys To restore your wallet with the 25 word mnemonic seed please see this guide To

send all 100 XMR I have and it got rejected by Binance because Network is busy I am running a local node on the background and I know there is no problem in network Then I tried to send 50 XMR to figure out at what amount their algorithm goes into network error and when it processes it as usual Now I got a new error Suspicious activity KYC verification required OK thats weird because I am already a verified account right I chatted with one of their customer support agent they sent me some copypaste answers even their apologies I understand your frustration etc are very artificial and preprepared You watched Wolf of Wall Street Its like the phone call scene there every answer they give feels very scripted Then I said OK I will play your game whatever just let me withdraw my XMR for gods sake I did KYC again face recognition ID etc Then I tried to send 50 XMR again and this time risk control error came out I am like what is going on I just went through a fresh KYC over an already verified account are you kidding What is a risk control if a person is confirmed over and over again how can you still assume I am somebody else Are you protecting myself from myself Again another customer support agent talk This time they want me to post a video yes you heard it right a video telling that I want to withdraw my XMR etc But wait a minute I was verified already and reverified again and the customer agent told me that withdrawal will definitely work after verification now you want a video Suddenly on my mind a picture appeared they want to record my movements how I talk voice etc and they want to record this data forever or sell it to whoever Then I remembered the Binance personal information hack that happened some years ago and decided that there is no way I am going to send in a video showing my movements voice etc After 34 hours of customer support agent discussions reading many copypaste scripted answers you heard it right 34 hours I convinced them there is no way I can send a video because my phone is broken Then they finally said we can do a manual KYC verification Remember this is happening 3rd time now I was already verified reverified and now verifying again Ive sent them a picture showing that I want to withdraw my monero etc blah blah blah They fixed it Of course I was forced to expose a lot of unnecessary further personal information there over normal KYC process Then when this whole KYC saga is over I tried to send 20 XMR this time and it worked just like the very first time similar to 0001 XMR very fast Then I tried to send in batches of 2 XMR until 10 XMR is completely transferred But just before my last batch this new error appeared XMR withdrawal suspended the network is currently experiences issues withdrawals paused They blocked all withdrawals of XMR over Binance or they wanted me to believe this is the case Then I said enough BS for one day and went to sleep to try tomorrow again but promising myself that when this last 20 XMR transfer is over I am going to close my Binance account and never touching it ever again Conclusion I am very positive that Binance does not have enough Monero to cover all user withdrawals When you try to withdraw especially on larger amounts they find multiple excuses to let you give up on it with X error Y error Z error However if you are very persistent and give up all your identity KYC and video then they will fix it But ask yourself would you like to go through all this BS each time you want to withdraw On trading side they have 100 fake monero When you try to withdraw an amount like 10 XMR you get network error automatically almost all the time If you try with smaller amounts like 23 monero it works but probably what is happening is that someone else has deposited at that moment so they use other users deposited monero on current users withdrawals But on larger amounts unless someone else deposits a large amount of XMR prepare yourself for an eternal network error or XMR withdrawal suspended the network is currently experiences issues withdrawals paused If you have monero on Binance try to take it on smaller amounts lower than 23 XMR and perhaps different times of the day so that you can capture some of that deposited user XMR To those people who deposit XMR to Binance thanks bro Because of you I could withdraw my XMR Your XMR is now being used with withdrawal of an another users XMR Good luck with your own withdrawal though I did same mistake as you and I regretted it I was a Binance user for a long time and I admired CZ just like I admired El0n Mu5k when he had Mars landing presentations etc However I come to realize that humans are all same when large amounts of money enter their life they become arrogant powerhungry and lose their very identity and morality They start to play miniGod and surround themselves with yesman and if their miniGod status ever gets challenged they go mad and use illegal practices that they did not use at the beginning of their story From my perspective CZ was not same as first time Binance was launched or maybe it was all an act then congratulations I was fooled by his humble image But he has a very similar story as El0n Mu5k and many others that started humble and promising only to end up as corrupted as any other dictator humans are 99 same Bottom line is that Do not overidolize anyone even Vitalik etc anyone I mean anyone Very very few people dont lose their minds when large amounts of money enter their life and props to those who still keep their feet on the ground But majority of humans have this weakness and that is the reason history repeats over and over again Sooner or later Binances turn will come and this fake monero issue will blow up on their face However I actually feel good about this Because it tells me that there is less monero on the market than reported which makes it more scarce which tells me the current price is manipulated and pressed by fake monero and when this blows over the price will blow over too Thanks for readingKeep stackingKeep using

monument not to our greatness but to our existence Abstract The root problem with conventional fiat currency of a single nation as a global reserve currency is all the trust thats required to make it work The central bank of the reserve currency issuer nation must be trusted not to debase the currency it also faces the conflict of economic interests that arises between shortterm domestic and longterm international objectives known as Triffins Dilemma but the history of global reserve currencies is full of breaches of that trust that have undermined global economic growth stability Moreover the exorbitant privilege of a nation being the global reserve currency issuer provides access to cheap capital but comes with the exorbitant burden of running constant deficits as well as reduced domestic economic growth loss of manufacturing unemployment Further the transition from the reserve currency of one nation to another has been preceded by wars or fiscal irresponsibility or natural disasters followed by economic woes for the whole world We propose a solution to peacefully aid the transition to a global reserve currency that does not lead to the loss of monetary sovereignty of states A peertopeer ecosystem of a world economy would allow commerce to flow without going through trusted intermediaries and financial institutions of the reserve currency sovereign state that have come to dominate the internet and extract value by facilitating transactions Furthermore rich countries and monopolistic corporations leverage their geopolitical and commercial dominance in the world economy via reserve currency status to depress or cheapen the prices of resources and labour in the global South Thus as a result for every unit of embodied resources and labour that the global South imports from the global North they have to export many more units to pay for it enabling the North to achieve a net appropriation through trade This is known as the theory of unequal exchange which has led to the spread of global inequality Bitcoin and Layer1 Blockchains provide a model of the solution by acting as a neutral mint buyer of last resort but the lack of a decentralized digital identity and absence of sovereign state participation in the ecosystem are the main issues that hinder adoption Most benefits are lost if trusted third parties like centralized webhosting services marketplaces social media and centralized exchanges are required to function We propose a model for a decentralized peertopeer circular economy that relies on a system where reserve currency can be earned from traditional commerce or issued for providing spare bandwidth storage and computational resources to the network as well as spent in the same ecosystem for utilizing these computational resources ultimately transcending into an information society and ushering in the fourth industrial revolution As a part of the model we also propose a system of establishing social trust utilizing verified credentials We also propose a solution for sovereign state participation in the network by a preminegrant of proposed supranational reserve currency to sovereign states on the basis of national debt foreign reserves in exchange for participation in the network and this reserve currency may be used to restructure debts provide a platform for issuance and use of Central Bank Digital Currencies tokenized assets or be used for storage processing transmission of information 1 Introduction Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions and corporations serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments host data websites marketplace listings and facilitate communication While the system worked well enough it has started to show its drawbacks which include disintermediation of users censorship collection of personally identifiable information and arbitrary commission rates Some sectors of the internet economy such as advertising and social media have been monopolized at the detriment of users Ensuring permanence of data is not possible since institutions and corporations cannot completely avoid regulations and security risks and represent a single point of failure The use of centralized platforms for commerce which often provide paid premium features and advertising have increased the cost of doing business and this cost has been passed onto the consumers These additional costs can be avoided by selfhosting data and websites but no mechanism exists to facilitate commerce on the internet without a trusted party or expensive hardware or technical knowhow The original Bitcoin code had a marketplace messaging component to it which was deprecated due to unknown reasons by Satoshi Nakamoto Todays largest centralized internet corporations undermine privacy and collect user data which they sell in exchange for the free services they provide The platforms also control who can access the data through their restrictive policies These corporations sometimes hold more wealth than sovereign states and exert considerable influence over public opinion and public policy despite having no system of checks and balances in place Various corporations today due their size user adoption and accumulation of wealth and data have created a parallel unaccounted digital economic ecosystem based on rules decided arbitrarily A theoretical supranational reserve currency known as Bancor was proposed by Keynes at the Bretton Woods Conference but the proposal was rejected due to its untenable interest rates on net surpluses in international trade as well as a lack of buyer of last resort The main objective of the International Monetary was to promote global financial stability but it has failed in its objective by relying on Fiat Currencies issued by sovereign states Bitcoin provides a model for a supranational reserve currency which can be anchored to a stable benchmark and is issued according to a clear set of rules therefore ensuring orderly supply second its supply is theoretically flexible enough to allow timely adjustment according to the changing demand consensus mechanism hard forks third such adjustments issuance are disconnected from economic conditions and sovereign interests of any single country The current state of Bitcoin and cryptotechnology ecosystem usually involves a high cost of entry For instance one must provide identity verification to centralized exchanges conduct multiple asset transfers and incur fees along the way The current state of Layer1 Blockchains like Ethereum is no better It involves the same pitfalls as accessing Bitcoin and involves installing browser extensions to interact with smart contracts decentralized applications which involves hefty fees and complexity Various Layer2 solutions have been proposed for blockchains but they usually involve bridging assets to the layer2 solutions powered by their own tokens and add even more complexity in participating in the cryptoeconomy Some argue that the most important part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool for distributed consensus but we propose that model for a neutral decentralized mint opensource nature of code running distributed systems and associated smart contracts Dapps is arguably the most important aspect of the cryptoecosystem The implications of this opensource nature of software development as opposed to walledgardens are far reaching as any improvements to a blockchain protocol or smart contract can essentially be utilized on other chains which have a superior network effect or user adoption In our model of a web3 economy we propose two components one is Digital Protocol which represents computational resources and the other is Market Protocol which represents decentralized identity marketplaces and tokenization of physical assets The protocol is neutral to anonymity but allows willing counterparties to choose the minimum information acceptable for commerce as per laws of the sovereign nation 2 Digital Protocol In our model the Digital Protocol may represent in whole or as part an application or a smart contract or an interface The basic components of the Digital Protocol are Storage Autonomous Transfer Operation Satellite Hashing and Interface Blockchain protocols with these utilities already exist isolated within their ecosystems a Storage Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions using a shared consensus mechanism This functionality of merely storing transactions has been further expanded to store any form of data The most popular iterations of this are Filecoin Chia Arweave While Filecoin enables storage of data for a defined period of time the arweave protocol provides permanent data storage beneficial for verified credentials tokenized assets smart contracts b Autonomous Smart Contracts that exist on the blockchain can be considered Autonomous Even Bitcoin protocol contains various OPCODES that enable such autonomous transactions This has been further advanced by the Ethereum Protocol via the Ethereum Virtual Machine V Transfer Double spending problem This refers to the ability to transfer unique digital tokenized assets and the prevention of double spending Bitcoin was the first protocol to provide a solution to the double spending problem without a central entity It may include interoperable CBDCs tokenized assets NFTs identities Soulbound tokens d Operation Proof of computation Useful Proofofwork Useful proofofwork blockchains such as the Ixec Blockchain Helium Network have made it possible to reward users for distributed computing e Satellite Proof of Coveragebandwidth This refers to the ability to send and receive information over the internet via mesh networking Blockchains that utilize spare bandwidth to enable mesh networking such as Helium already exist It may also allow nodes points of sale commerce to monetize spare bandwidth as well as allow a greater population to access the internet by providing incentives to the general public telecom satellite operators f Hashing This refers to the cryptographic hash function which is a oneway hash function that maps any arbitrary data to a bit array of a fixed size Hash value It may also refer to the consensus mechanisms deployed to add new blocks to the blockchain g Interface Decentralized SocialSteemDapps Nodes may also operate their own interfaces providing frontend services to users Even though a nodeinterface may set its own rules moderation policies regarding the content that is displayed by their interfaces For eg A marketplace may only allow users from certain sovereign state or credentials to display its products or a social media interface may only allow verified users or be open to all users Popular interfaces may be able to charge a node fee or listing fees for content to be visible on their interfaces 3 Marketplace Protocol This proposed protocol refers to the physical digital intersection of commerce Even though real estate stocks identities can be tokenized they hold little value without credible oracles reputable sovereign institutions verifying such data We propose a single unified protocol which captures data that is shared compiled and stored by sovereign states in one singular database by providing uniformity in how the data is captured across various government departments and agencies This may include decentralized identities through which a citizen may prove various credentials without sharing personally identifiable information using zero knowledge proofs It includes a global marketplace protocol to facilitate PeertoPeer commerce in which various kinds of credentials associations enable consumers to make informed choices It may also include other stake holders such as banks financial institutions stock exchanges and other entities that may issue verified credentials as authorized by sovereign states This will enable commerce capital to flow freely with the counterparty risk that is acceptable to both parties in a transaction The basic components of this protocol are Nationality Association Knowledge Assets Marketplace Organization Taxation Operation a Nationality This refers to various sovereign states observer members of the United Nations that may issue verified credentials to individuals or entities under its control For eg A Social Security Number Aaadhar number or unique identifier for a government agency that may issue verified credentials to users or organizations or a national stock exchange that may issue credentials to companies listed on the exchange This may also enable sovereign states to issue CBDCs that are interoperable and backed by their respective central banks Central Banks may decide access to CBDCs or capital controls or models they want to pursue to distribute CBDCs in domestic economies or only allow them to be used for international trade b Association This refers to various associations that dominate the economic landscape for example industry organizations political parties international organizations etc It may also include associations by private individuals of other individuals in the absence of a wellrecognized association c Knowledge Doctor Lawyer Accountant Driving License Degrees This refers to the verified credentials issued by educational institutions or trade bodies that may help the service economy to flourish For eg a decentralized version of uber may require driving licenses or a service marketplace may require plumberelectrician certification Further service marketplaces may flourish using these verified credentials d Assets Stocks real estate registries physical goods etc This refers to the tokenization of stocks other physical assets For example a stock exchange issued verified credentials by a sovereign state may further issue credentials to companies to tokenize their stocks further enabling capital inflows foreign direct investment in a country This may apply to land registries as well as other assets that can tokenized and verified by institutions entities regulation such assets e Marketplace This refers to a marketplace protocol that may provide listings for physical goods Particl Blockchain Protocol Openbazaar have already demonstrated these capabilities It may also include trade licenses food licenses other regulatory compliances needed to operate in an economy A marketplace that is decentralized at the protocol level may be centralized at the interface level as frontends may only include products that are approved by the node administrator or may be open to all f Organization Employer organization or other reputable organizations may issue verified credentials to its employees or members providing access to confidential data or privileged access to certain services g Taxation Smart Contracts that enable taxation by sovereign states or Taxation IDs or taxation records that may allow government agencies to view a private blockchain For example viewkeys in the Monero Protocol It may also enable determination of income for uncollateralized lending h Oracle This may refer to other records data that is generated by sovereign or private entities in the economy It may include pricing feeds insurance records credit scores medical records criminal record traffic violations etc 4 The Challenge model for transition Apart from the humongous technical challenges of scalability protecting privacy and developing this protocol sovereign participation is essential as trusted providers of verified credentials We propose a global injection of liquidity in the global economy via a predefined formula to reflect current economic status of sovereign states Sovereign States can distribute this currency to local governments and organizations that can provide verified credentials as well as distribute this currency to citizens alongwith CBDCs For instance a decentralized version of Uber would at the very least require verification of driving license credentials a food delivery platform may require health authority licenses land ownership can be verified by registrars public universities may authenticate degrees Users that do not have these credentials may still operate in this economy and compete if they provide a valuable service at lower prices We propose the following formulae for allocation of the proposed currency at a fixed rate pegged to the dollar Public Debt Denominated in Dollars X 025 GDP PPP X 2 IMF Reserve Currency Reserves in Dollar rates X 3 5 Use cases a Decentralized web and operating system b International reserve currency global unit of account for international trade c Banking the unbanked providing a standardized global ID system d Permaweb permanent data storage decentralized distributed computing for AI research e DeFi This can be used for availing loans against your tokenised assets such as stocks digital assets as collateral for flash loans or over collateralized loans f Access to credit For instance if Alice is a member of a reputed farmer association or trade association that provides insurance against shortterm loans then they may use their association verified credentials insurance credentials to procure a shortterm loan from a bank or financial institution to pay for farming inputs seeds etc

Sidechains eg Plasma and OmiseGo and tracing challenges following the integration of the Schnorr Signature algorithm Acquiring applications to allow an investigation to more easily trace privacy coins and other protocols that provide anonymity to illicit actors would allow investigations to be more effective as well as facilitate a higher level of deterrence by making it harder to conceal criminal activity It also provides an investigative efficiency that is currently limited We are primary interested in 1 an interactive prototype that provides a GUI for clustering transactions involving a user similar to tools provided by companies like Chainalysis CipherTrace Coinbase and Elliptic but for the privacy coins and obfuscation technologies 2 associate user distributed addresses with distributed ledger addresses of users individuals or entities suspected or known to be involved in nefarious activities 3 provide a library of distributed ledger addresses associated with names of users engaged in known or suspected nefarious activities 4 provide OSINT informationresearch about identified users 5 has a mechanism for sharing investigative research between investigators 6 ability to importexport investigative data in various file formats eg csv and jpg and 7 an estimate of the cost and return on investment ROI Just noting the example coins arent listed in alphabetical order I think we can safely assume that Monero is IRS Enemy 1 Then the Request for Proposals published 20200904 The original goals of the work The primary goals of this solution challenge are 1 Provide information and technical capabilities for CI Special Agents to trace transaction inputs and outputs to a specific user and differentiate them from mixinsmultisig actors for Monero andor Lightning Layer 2 cryptocurrency transactions with minimal involvement of external vendors 2 Provide technology which given information about specific parties andor transactions in the Monero andor Lightning networks allows Special Agents to predict statistical likelihoods of other transaction inputs outputs metadata and public identifiers with minimal involvement of external vendors 3 Provide algorithms and source code to allow CI to further develop modify and integrate these capabilities with internal code and systems with minimal costs licensing issues or dependency on external vendors All solutions must support cryptocurrency transactions that occurred in 2020 All solutions for the must support open standards for interoperability common file formats REST APIs etc as appropriate to facilitate easy integration into internally developed IRSCI cryptocurrency analytic systems and data When responding please keep the three above goals in mind We are looking for solutions which provide the best results for tracing obfuscated cryptocurrency transactions using Monero andor Lightning however all three goals are important and a solution that produces good statistical likelihoods of transaction parties but does not provide easy to integrate source code will not be rated as highly as one that provides both source code that can be integrated with CI systems and produces good statistical likelihoods of transaction parties Contractors may choose to submit solutions to address Monero or Lightning transactions or both as all approaches will be considered Note that the contractors were free to target either Monero or Lightning Network at their option So successful completion of these contracts didnt necessarily mean a successful attack on Monero they could have just gone for the easier target LN The contracts were awarded to Chainalysis and Integra FEC published 20200930 The work was structured in two phases 500k for Phase 1 lasting 8 months to develop a Proof of Concept and then 125K for Phase 2 lasting 4 months for testing and deployment You can do a web search for the two contract IDs Integra Contract No 2032H820C00040 Chainalysis Contract No 2032H820C00041 and youll find that the contracts were completed and both companies were eventually paid in full The contracts began on 20200930 and ended on 20210929 Three months later 20211210 Chainalysis started advertising support for Lightning Network Ive never been able to locate any relevant announcements from Integra at all but presumably if they had succeeded theyd be advertising to their customers too I havent found any followups on those contract IDs listing whatever results were finally delivered but if Chainalysis had tackled Monero and succeeded I believe they would have blogged about it and advertised it as an offering to their customers They havent done so

ActivityPub including Mastodon tldr Tips to content creators like Twitch streamers is a big business Now could be the moment given Mastodons hotness to implement this in a way that is fully open source decentralized and is private with respect to the tippers and content creators other transactions ie the tip cant be linked to your grocery store or employer This can be done because ActivityPub is a highly flexible decentralized social media protocol Background Mastodon is currently pretty hot A quick summary Mastodon is a federated social media network with a UI similar to Twitter Federated means that its a single communication network without independent servers examples include email or Matrix In fact the network is even bigger than Mastodon its uses ActivityPub and so users on Mastodon can follow and respond to other services that use ActivityPub like Lemmy which is similar to Reddit PeerTube which is similar to YouTube Pleroma which is also like Twitter but with some technical differences from Mastodon As far as I know these were all started and are still maintained by independent developers they just use the same protocol Federation is basically the ultimate solution to vendor lockin Monero itself could be construed to be federated since the nodes talk to each other Also see the term Fediverse For example even though I only have a Mastodon account I can still follow Rucknium on Pleroma here From the server Im on his profile looks like this The cocreator of ActivityPub has 4500 followers despite the server he is on having only one user himself ActivityPub has basically no tipping functionality Imagine a future where people on a federated social network some of them running on personal servers tip artists streamers or fundraisers in Monero Tipping Examples Here are some examples of how tipping can be useful Note that this technically doesnt need social media to function but people tend to donate more in some cases when the donations are public and embedded in social media Fundraiser tip posts on Mastodon or Pleroma describing the fundraiser Could also be on Lemmy as part of an AMA for the fundraiser Art tip posts on Mastodon Pleroma or PixelFed with the art Streaming send comments with tips on PeerTube or OwnCast Note for example that monerokon uses OwnCast OwnCast might need its own patch since ActivityPub doesnt work well with real time comments You can still federate account information though This would be a fully decentralized and open source alternative to Twitch Donations and rewards Video content creators send comments with tips on PeerTube This would be a fully decentralized and open source alternative to YouTube superchats Possible technical approaches In theory all of the above should be possible without needing to repeat work for every network the tipping software just needs to support ActivityPub except OwnCast probably needs a little extra support The most natural way to go about this imo would be by adding the functionality to Mastodon or Pleroma via a patch that servers can add This is because donations are typically short messages which is how Mastodon and Pleroma work For brevity Ill assume were doing this with Mastodon To be eligible to receive Monero tips a user would add a Monero public key field to their profile on whatever ActivityPub account they are using Users of the patched Mastodon server or technically a patched client might be able to work too can then include Monero tips in their messages to accounts with such a public key Posting this generates a Monero payment request which is opened in the users own wallet you dont upload your private keys to the server of course Information is sent to the patched Mastodon so anyone can verify the payment The patched Mastodon server advertises via ActivityPub that a Monero tip is part of the message Any user using a server or client that has Monero support builtin can double check this is the case it can even list the number of confirmations although this probably isnt super important with tips For someone like a streamer they can then react to the Monero tips live and even automatically For example they could have text to speech read the donation message or have rewards for certain donations like something badnerf happening in a video game they are playing Some social considerations Many mastodon users dont like crypto or the word Web3 because they are fleeing the crypto scams on Twitter We might want to emphasize that Monero is just a payment method not a get rich quick scheme and also that it is essentially the opposite of NFTs However they are huge fans of privacy since many of them come from communities with doxxing or overpolicing problems So we can definitely lean into that We might also want to show content creators how they can use CakeWallet or something to buy things with Monero So what do yall think Unfortunately I dont have any plans to code any of this myself I just thought Id put the idea out there

get from those Originally published on GitHub here and discussed in a recent meeting of the Seraphis dev workgroup I post this here as well to reach the broader Monero community and invite all interested parties to comment TLDR Jamtis addresses as now designed double the length of current Monero addresses and approach 200 characters Much thought and much discussion among Monero Research Lab members went into this that length increase did not just happen and the new addresses solve quite a number of longstanding issues with the current CryptoNote style Monero addresses While going through everything I did not meet any good way for a significant length reduction without losing important added functionality With the increased length on the negative side I try to argue that so many improvements are on the positive side that its worth to swallow this toad and its a good way forward to start thinking how to build good user interfaces and achieve a good user experience for them The Issue If we implement Jamtis as currently designed Monero addresses will get longer Their length will increase from 95 to nearly 200 characters As addresses are of course a fundamental element of the cryptocurrency that all of its users will have to deal with doubling their length is certainly a serious issue In this text I try to explain how that comes to be and what positive effects we get in exchange of the length increase as a clearly negative effect The Status Quo Monero addresses currently are 95 characters long These may already be the longest cryptocurrency addresses in wider use today They are a feature of CrypoNote the system that Monero inherited when it forked code back in 2014 and this part was never modified as far as the length and the content of the addresses is concerned Here an example of such an address 4BJL9uzgcMkLEPTQMDSjRJAMwnNhoDt96UkSJoYsm5CQfJxgix 18vBjYNzWTMUnhyYg2jFsEPW5M2N34K58d3uLCMbvLNEY The alphabet used here consists of 58 digits and letters This encoding system is called Base58 see eg here for details and how it compares to other such encodings Already these 95 characters are too long to display Monero addresses in full in most parts of the user interface in wallet apps They usually resort to only display parts of addresses The Monero GUI wallet would with a small size of its window use the 4 first and the 4 last characters to display the sample address in lists of transactions done as 4BJL LNEY With a larger window it would add 2 such groups of 4 characters and display 4BJL 9uzg CMbv LNEY As its very unlikely to have 2 addresses with the same 4 first and 4 first last characters it is usually considered good enough to display them this way in lists It seems unlikely that people really type in 95 characters frequently when they want to send XMR somewhere as that would clearly be a pain and also hard to get right on first attempt Typically you cut and paste such addresses or read a QR code to get them Thinking about it I wonder why I never read any serious complaints about the length of current Monero addresses and no FAQ along the line of 95 characters are too long Cant you make that shorter Seems to me people cope mostly fine today The Proposed Jamtis Addresses Jamtis tries to solve quite a list of serious issues with the current CryptoNote system that became clear over the years I will detail the relevant ones further on As far as addresses are concerned it proposes a quite radical break with the past and arrives at clearly different and much longer addresses Here an example of a Jamtis address that I took from jberman s excellent and highly recommended presentation about Seraphis and Jamtis direct PDF download link here xmr1majob1977bw3ympyh2yxd7hjymrw8crc9kinodkm8d3wdu 8jdhf3fkdpmgxfkbywbb9mdwkhkya4jtfnod5h7s49bfyji193 6w19tyf396ypjo9n64runqjrxwp6k2s3phxwm6wrb5cob6c1nt rg2mugeocwdgnnr7u7bgknya9arksrj This sample address does not yet reflect a recent modification that makes addresses a bit longer still and pushes them to almost 200 characters but that does not matter too much as you get the right impression nevertheless I followed design work on Jamtis in 2021 and 2022 and took away the impression that all important aspects of these new addresses are well thought out and they were discussed among MRL members to quite some extent In the following I will try to argue that those addresses dont just happen to be so long and that you could not make them shorter without losing important features The Case for Base32 You may notice that Jamtis addresses use a different alphabet The mix of uppercase and lowercase letters of Base58 is gone all letters are lowercase Its called Base32 because only 32 different characters are used You find details eg here Base32 needs somewhere between 15 and 20 more characters to encode the same information than Base58 So whats on the positive side of 35 or so characters more With using Base32 Jamtis follows a very carefully designed secondgeneration system for addresses called Bech32 that comes from the Bitcoin world You find info about it eg here One advantage of the reduced alphabet is better QR codes As you can read here QR codes have several socalled input modes If you use uppercase as well as lowercase letters you have to use binary input mode with 8 bits per character If you dont need casing you can use alphanumeric input mode with ony 55 bits per character Of course there are no half bits 2 characters go into 11 bits So with Base32 you can either make the QR code quite a bit smaller or you can use better error correction if you keep the same size A second important advantage is the possibility to use a better algorithm for the checksum As the linked Bech32 page mentions most of the research on errordetecting codes only applies to characterset sizes that are a prime power which 58 is not but 32 is being a power of 2 a prime Jamtis addresses can use a checksum based on polynomials that are quite easy to calculate in any case easier than hashes that are used for current Monero addresses but still allow very good error detection Readers interested in technical details find them eg here You may see the tradeoffs more characters versus better QR codes and better checksums differently than the Jamtis designer and the MRL members but the important points to take away in my opinion are that as already mentioned much deliberation went into this design and changing it would have a number of consequences The Third Key Current Monero addresses contain 2 public keys of 32 bytes of information each Jamtis addresses contain a third such key which contributes to the increased address length to quite some degree As you can read in the MRL issue 92 about address schemes the third key was born to mitigate Janus attacks With Jamtis we are on the Janus B line of that table listing possible address schemes In short a Monero wallet can have several addresses where ideally there would be a watertight guarantee that its impossible for any outsider to determine whether two addresses belong to the same wallet or not As Janus attacks show its not possible to give such a guarantee for current Monero The third key in Jamtis addresses closes the hole in the system and so increases privacy Subsequent work on Jamtis and Seraphis showed that this new key can also be used to achieve other solid advances like faster scanning of the blockchain and making thirdparty scanning services possible that cant see the amounts of the enotes they find on behalf of users Again nobody just threw in 32 bytes more in the form of a third key because they thought that might be cool without caring about the length increase The third key allows significant improvements and dropping it would cause a lot of things to slide and need a significant rework of the design Address Tags Jamtis addresses as currently proposed contain an address tag of 18 bytes that like the third key is a significant factor in the length increase Originally only 8 bytes a quite long discussion to widen it to 18 bytes starts here in the comment section of the Jamtis design paper What do we get in exchange for so many bytes With current Monero there is a potential problem with receiving funds to subaddresses that are far away from the highest subaddress that is currently used the wallet may never see them and they might as well not exist and in general a wallet internally has to generate a quite large socalled lookahead table of potential subaddresses to check for incoming funds even if everything goes as expected which complicates matters Those 18bytes address tags completely eliminate the potential receive problem and the need for complicated look ahead When merchants have to track payments from customers the advice for a long time already is to use a separate subaddress per order or at least per customer Generating subaddresses as part of a software for merchants has proved to be anything but trivial however For example with current Monero you cant just randomly generate subaddresses because you would run into the mentioned receiving problem and the space of possible subaddresses is not big enough to guard against generating the same subaddress twice by bad luck to a sufficient degree You have to track what you generated already which can get quite hairy if eg you need multiple servers for a hightraffic system These are reasons why integrated addresses are still around despite being declared deprecated by the Monero dev community Again the wide address tags fully do away with these problems and there are no integrated addresses anymore in Jamtis because no longer needed Merchant systems can almost trivially generate subaddresses at random with a similar protection against duplicates as the wellknown GUIDs and can be sure to receive any funds sent to those without any difficulty Possible Hardware and Software Limitations While discussing the long Jamtis addresses in the No Wallet Left Behind Matrix room the question came up whether there is hardware that is so memoryconstrained that we will run into trouble Two candidates mentioned are NFC tags and hardware wallets It seems that there is a bewildering array of standards for NFC tags and corresponding actual hardware See eg here The impression I got is that while lowend tags may indeed lack the necessary 200 bytes to hold even a single Jamtis address other tags can do so comfortably with room to spare It may be a question to choose the right tags if you want to implement something Monero related then How it looks with hardware wallets is hard to say They probably dont have problems already with merely addresses but maybe with firmware capacity to hold the code for supporting Seraphis and Jamtis in general If that really was the case and if we put high priority on hardware wallet support the ultimate consequence would probably be to postpone the hardfork altogether until hardware wallets have grown powerful enough This seems like something hard to get consensus for to me Anyway if I look at the just introduced Ledger Stax hardware wallet I think there is hope that in two years time there will be a healthy choice of hardware wallets capable of supporting the new Monero Two other things that we probably should keep an eye on are DNS TXT entries for the system that lets you use nice names instead of Monero addresses where a single such TXT entry has a maximum length of 255 but multiple entries are possible and transport of unsigned transactions for cold signing using QR codes multiple are needed today per transaction but probably more will be needed with Seraphis and Jamtis RIDs According to the Jamtis spec RID stands for recipient ID For every Jamtis address you can calculate such an RID which looks like this regnehwbnau21ghb54no8x36q Despite their short length its very improbable to have two different addresses that have the same RID by chance and its very hard for an adversary to actively find a second such address eg as part of an attempt to scam you Instead of comparing Jamtis addresses over their full length of nearly 200 characters which is of course a pain and instead of only comparing a few characters coming from the start and the end of the addresses which may not be reliable enough you can safely and easily compare the RIDs of two Jamtis addresses to see whether they are identical or not They cant replace Jamtis addresses however you cant send XMR using the RID instead of an address You could say that an RID is a humanfriendly checksum for Jamtis addresses Compared with deeply ingrained parts of the Jamtis spec like the third key and the long address tags we might be able to explore other ways of arriving at such a humanfriendly checksum without causing havoc if needed but in any case it looks confirmed there are suitable ways to have something short enough that we can display as part of wallet user interfaces My Personal Conclusion As mentioned seems to me already our current 95 character addresses are rarely ever typed and mostly transported using the clipboard or QR codes You can easily do that with addresses that are two times current length or even longer so no fundamentally new approach to handle them is needed We have almost weekly posts about Monero problems like slow sync or wrong restore height in the Monero subreddit but hardly anybody ever complaining about our long addresses which in my opinion wants to tell us something The textual representation of my public PGP key is over 1600 characters long but nobody seems to see such keys to be a serious UIUX obstacle Of course it would still be pretty dumb to burden ourselves with addresses that are 200 characters long if we could get the same benefits with substantially shorter addresses or if the added benefits turn out to be less great than assumed so far But after going through much of the available info in preparation of writing this text I encountered no good to way to shorten significantly and no candidates for features that we could take out of the spec again to arrive at shorter addresses My personal take on this matter is therefore Lets swallow that toad and use features like RIDs and perhaps additional ones not yet invented to arrive at good user interfaces for wallet apps and websites to deal with 200character Jamtis addresses as currently designed But for sure I am just a single voice in the Monero community and I hope that the material presented here can serve as a good base for discussion and arriving soon at some loose consensus how to go forward regarding addresses

might require your documents for verification and approval of your account LocalMonero peertopeer exchange They have pretty much everything as a payment method and they support hundreds of fiat options How can I quickly exchange my Monero XMR for Bitcoin BTC There are multiple ways to exchange your Monero for Bitcoin but first of all Id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for Monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept Monero directly as payment Ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration That being said the community has been recommending two services in particular ChangeNOW and SideShiftAI These services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the Monero Project DYOR and be diligent How do I mine Monero And other mining questions The correct place to ask questions and discuss the Monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rMoneroMining That being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the GetMoneroorg website 2 Wallet CLI GUI Why I cant see my balance Where is my XMR Before any action there are two things to check 1 Are you using the latest available version of the wallet A new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on GetMoneroorg with your wallets version on Settings under Debug info 2 Is your wallet fully synchronized If it isnt wait the sync to complete Because Monero is different from Bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant The software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions Check in the lower left corner GUI if the wallet is synchronized You cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network So please wait If this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on StackExchange How do I upgrade my wallet to the newest version This question is beautifully answered on StackExchange Why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time You have decided to use Moneros wallet and run a local node Congratulations You have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost The first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 GB and constantly growing There are technologies being implemented in Monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node Consider syncing to a device that has an SSD instead of an HDD as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization Now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet I dont want to download the blockchain how can I skip that The way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node You can follow this guide on how to set it up You can find a list of public remote nodes on MoneroWorld Be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy A public remote node is able to identify your IP and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy A remote

been gaining a lot of traction lately with smartBCH being the golding boy on the block Since the smartBCH Defi network took off I have been sitting on the fence watching how things will play out but after seeing the results from several of my friends and some users here I finally decided to dive in and see what the buzz is all about I have been holding back from getting involved in any smartBCH project because I didnt want to put my money in something that I dont know how it will pan out I was also afraid that I will lose my money since there have been a series of rug pulls in most smartBCH projects I decided to finally get involved after reading some of the Defi communitys success stories and watching the recent live chat with several of the Defi team members of the Tropical finance Dex I am ready to pull the plunge because I believe that the smartBCH has a lot of potentials and its a great project to get involved with now that it is looking healthier I am also glad that I decided to get involved when it was still in the early days because I think that now that it has been around for a while it will be a lot more difficult to get scammed This is because there are so many people who have been in and out of the project from the beginning so they will be able to provide valuable insights on how things are progressing I am hoping that by getting involved now I will be able to gather enough information and evidence to support my investment thesis in the future I look forward to being part of the smartBCH community and I hope that most of the projects will be able to provide the same level of support that the Tropical community has been able to provide its members I am not a big investor I will be starting my smartBCH journey with a modest investment capital of 500 to be shared across several projects I will be making small investments in projects that I think have the highest potential and will provide me with the best returns I will also be contributing to the projects that I feel will be able to provide the best support to their community and will be able to provide value to the ecosystem I believe that the more support a project can provide the more trustworthy it can be which will in turn lead to the success of the projects From the information that I have seen posted here about some of the projects on smartBCH presently and the testimonials from several of my friends I have been able to evaluate the strength and potentials of some of the projects that I believe meet my criteria I have evaluated four of the projects that I believe will be able to provide support and value to the ecosystem I will be investing in these projects to see whether they are as good as I think that they are or will I lose my money I will also be looking at other projects that I know will provide value to the ecosystem because I believe that the more value a project has the more reliable it will be The more reliable a project is the more trustworthy it is because a reliable project is less likely to be compromised or scammed The four projects that I have selected to be part of my 500 budgeted in smartBCH are Law token Daiquiri BPAD and Mist tokens I will be sharing the 500 budgeted in those projects with Daiquiri taking the lion share of 200 Law token taking 150 and BPAD taking 100 and Mist taking the remaining 50 This is how I will be dividing the budget among the four projects I will be starting my smartBCH journey with those four projects that I believe will be able to provide value to the ecosystem I will be making my first investment in the Law token project because I believe that this project has the potential to be one of the best in the smartBCH ecosystem I will also be investing in the Daiquiri and the BPAD project because I have read a lot of success stories and success tips from other users who have been in the smartBCH community for some time now I will also be contributing to the Mist tokens project because I believe that this is a great project that is undervalued and has the potential to provide a lot of value to the smartBCH ecosystem I will be investing in small increments so that I can monitor the progress of each of the projects and will be making more investments if the progress that I am seeing is good enough to warrant it I will also be making investments in other projects that I think will be able to provide value to the ecosystem in the future I hope that this article has been able to provide some insights on how I will be investing in the smartBCH ecosystem and also how I plan to make a profit in the long run I believe that the more value a project can provide to the smartBCH ecosystem the more reliable it will be which will in turn lead to the success of the projects I also hope that this article has been able to provide an idea of the strategies that I will be using in my investments I am not an expert in investment I will be learning as I go along and I welcome every bit of advice and guidance that can be provided to me Bottom line As a small investor I wouldnt want to test the depth of the river with both feet nor would I put all my eggs in one basket with my modest 500 invested in smartBCH across four projects I think its safe to say that I will be able to provide some support to the Defi ecosystem while at the same time providing a buffer for my 500 should any of the projects fail to perform as expected I will also be making some profits in the long run because I believe that the more value a project can provide to the smartBCH ecosystem the higher its price will rise which in turn provides me with more profits I will continue making investments in the smartBCH ecosystem and this is just the beginning I am so happy to be able to complete this article and to make it more appealing to readers with the help of Grammarly I was able to take a step further in my writing skill Thank you for your time and dont forget to leave a comment

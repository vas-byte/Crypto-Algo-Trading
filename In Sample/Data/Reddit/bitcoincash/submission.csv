I have created a website, and I would like your opinion.

The website [https://www.1bitcoincash.com](https://www.1bitcoincash.com) was created to promote Bitcoin Cash.

The available advertising space on the page is 1 000 000 Pixels and the advertisement has no expiry date, this is what gives the advertisement its value.

1 Pixel = 0.000001 BCH

Minimum order is 10px ×10px=0.0001 BCH

Paid ads are running on [https://read.cash/](https://read.cash/)

I'll listen to any ideas or advice.

Thank you in advance for your answer.","self","https://redd.it/rvr6ix"

I am developing a (web)game which generates a wallet for each unique player. I need to be able to receive (near real-time) notifications about deposits to my backend (in this case: Bitcoin Cash).

I've looked at some services that offer this, but the billing model will make it very expensive very quickly. I've also looked at running electron-cash, but the notify command supports address subscriptions only - not wallet notifications. Aside of that I'm worried about the scalability of electron-cash as a notifier.

What would be the way forward, given the following:

- Each player gets his/her own deposit address
- My backend needs to receive a notification when a transaction occurs (even without confirmation)
- Solution needs to scale, e.g. I can't subscribe to each and every address
- If I have a reliable daemon that can sniff out all BCH transactions in real time that could potentially work, but I don't know of any (and not for BCH)

Thanks in advance :)","self","https://redd.it/s0p18n"

I found this game called ""BCH Games"", where you get BCH for free (as a promotion of crypto currency) so you can play. If you lose, simply click on faucet and it will refill it for you (5 min wait). You don't risk anything, but in the process you can earn some free crypto currency. You are gambling, but not really risking anything. If you feel more confident that you can crypto, you can also deposit.

If you use my [REF LINK](https://bch.games/play/7d6a2b53) you get some BCH for free. Here is also [NON - REF - LINK](https://bch.games/).

Wish you all best luck and I hope you will like the games provided by BCH Games.","self","https://redd.it/s22d5p"

No other cryptocurrency has the laser focus on global scale and true peer to peer currency.

No other cryptocurrency has the best of both worlds: a secure PoW layer 1 electronic cash system, and a secure layer 2 proof-of-stake smart contract platform. All powered by one coin: BCH.

Like every citizen of this beautiful continent that we call America, I have been a victim of leftist governments and bad decisions made by pseudo Economists, lovers of the paternalistic state.

Now you may wonder what all this introduction owes to, it is because mainly as crypto enthusiasts, knowing them all was love at first sight BTC in its beginnings was a faithful reflection of the inherent need for electronic cash that would allow payments online are sent directly, from one entity to another. All this without having to go through a financial institution.

This financial institution, also known as a trusted third party, has always been one of the weakest links, still suffering from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, because financial institutions cannot avoid mediation in disputes.

And in many cases these own financial institutions based on ""anti-laundering"" algorithms block funds, censor and close accounts under a dictatorial discretion of which Josef Stanlin would be proud, I am talking about institutions like PayPal, Neteller, Payonner, Payer, Zelle, Skrill, also of Traditional Banking.

BTC broke in almost 13 years ago, with the faithful promise that we would no longer need a trusted third party, no more annoying KYC, no more account locks, or hand over our assets to a custodian.

And as of today can we say that Bitcoin won? Absolutely NO, I have even more paradoxical that it sounds we can affirm that BTC has helped to increase centralization and that many of its attributes are being eliminated, as many will say, nowadays it is impossible to use BTC to pay for a product or service, When the transaction fees are probably much higher than the amount to be paid, and not friends, using custodian services such as Centralized Exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) is not a solution, since you are at the mercy of a third party, which always wanted to avoid, Lightning Network is another great scam a 2 layer system, highly objectionable, centralized and that needs to know our identity to even use it.

The p2p is dead, no perse, but if you are in a coma in a world where they want to make millionaires with the next meme coin, few pay attention to what is truly important, freedom, independence, anonymity, that provide the critics, it is not something that The great institutions want us citizens to obtain and only through education can we prevent them from destroying what they have achieved so much.

Many other currencies such as XMR, BCH, XRP have focused on a solution to occupy the huge space and market that electronic p2p payments mean, perhaps in the near or distant future, we will have the real p2p to free us.

Since the smartBCH Defi network took off, I have been sitting on the fence watching how things will play out, but after seeing the results from several of my friends and some users here I finally decided to dive in and see what the buzz is all about.

I have been holding back from getting involved in any smartBCH project because I didn't want to put my money in something that I don't know how it will pan out. I was also afraid that I will lose my money since there have been a series of rug pulls in most smartBCH projects. I decided to finally get involved after reading some of the Defi community's success stories and watching the recent live chat with several of the Defi team members of the Tropical finance Dex.

I am ready to pull the plunge because I believe that the smartBCH has a lot of potentials and it's a great project to get involved with now that it is looking healthier. I am also glad that I decided to get involved when it was still in the early days because I think that now that it has been around for a while, it will be a lot more difficult to get scammed. This is because there are so many people who have been in and out of the project from the beginning so they will be able to provide valuable insights on how things are progressing. I am hoping that by getting involved now, I will be able to gather enough information and evidence to support my investment thesis in the future. I look forward to being part of the smartBCH community and I hope that most of the projects will be able to provide the same level of support that the Tropical community has been able to provide its members.

I am not a big investor, I will be starting my smartBCH journey with a modest investment capital of $500 to be shared across several projects. I will be making small investments in projects that I think have the highest potential and will provide me with the best returns. I will also be contributing to the projects that I feel will be able to provide the best support to their community and will be able to provide value to the ecosystem. I believe that the more support a project can provide, the more trustworthy it can be which will, in turn, lead to the success of the projects.

From the information that I have seen posted here about some of the projects on smartBCH presently, and the testimonials from several of my friends I have been able to evaluate the strength and potentials of some of the projects that I believe meet my criteria. I have evaluated four of the projects that I believe will be able to provide support and value to the ecosystem.

I will be investing in these projects to see whether they are as good as I think that they are, or will I lose my money. I will also be looking at other projects that I know will provide value to the ecosystem because I believe that the more value a project has, the more reliable it will be. The more reliable a project is, the more trustworthy it is because a reliable project is less likely to be compromised or scammed.

The four projects that I have selected to be part of my $500 budgeted in smartBCH are Law token, Daiquiri, BPAD, and Mist tokens. I will be sharing the $500 budgeted in those projects with Daiquiri taking the lion share of $200, Law token taking $150, and BPAD taking $100, and Mist taking the remaining $50. This is how I will be dividing the budget among the four projects.

I will be starting my smartBCH journey with those four projects that I believe will be able to provide value to the ecosystem. I will be making my first investment in the Law token project because I believe that this project has the potential to be one of the best in the smartBCH ecosystem. I will also be investing in the Daiquiri and the BPAD project because I have read a lot of success stories and success tips from other users who have been in the smartBCH community for some time now. I will also be contributing to the Mist tokens project because I believe that this is a great project that is undervalued and has the potential to provide a lot of value to the smartBCH ecosystem. I will be investing in small increments so that I can monitor the progress of each of the projects and will be making more investments if the progress that I am seeing is good enough to warrant it. I will also be making investments in other projects that I think will be able to provide value to the ecosystem in the future.

I hope that this article has been able to provide some insights on how I will be investing in the smartBCH ecosystem, and also how I plan to make a profit in the long run. I believe that the more value a project can provide to the smartBCH ecosystem, the more reliable it will be, which will in turn lead to the success of the projects. I also hope that this article has been able to provide an idea of the strategies that I will be using in my investments. I am not an expert in investment, I will be learning as I go along, and I welcome every bit of advice and guidance that can be provided to me.

Bottom line

As a small investor, I wouldn't want to test the depth of the river with both feet nor would I put all my eggs in one basket. with my modest $500 invested in smartBCH across four projects, I think it's safe to say that I will be able to provide some support to the Defi ecosystem, while at the same time, providing a buffer for my $500 should any of the projects fail to perform as expected. I will also be making some profits in the long run because I believe that the more value a project can provide to the smartBCH ecosystem, the higher its price will rise, which in turn, provides me with more profits. I will continue making investments in the smartBCH ecosystem, and this is just the beginning.

I am so happy to be able to complete this article and to make it more appealing to readers. with the help of Grammarly, I was able to take a step further in my writing skill. Thank you for your time, and don't forget to leave a comment.","self","https://redd.it/s3i3wz"

each share has 0.00907317 BCH , so:

 190 BCHG shares x 0.00907317 = 1.7239023 BCH , yet this only costs $380 (each share is $2)

1 BCH sells for $380

So if you were going to hold for the long term anyway, why not gain nearly double the amount of BCH?

All coins are stored with coinbase custody, so ye its not your own wallet, but coinbase is probably the best exchange in the world. So ye cold storage is good, but so is turning 1 BCH into 1.72 BCH.

At my humble level i continue to buy, hold, spend and replace (using crypto card when i can spend in BCH)
Tip 
And buy the dip (now i can't...)

I literally subscribe to all channels of Twitter promoting BCH and like a lot of video YouTube about positive infos on BCH 

We are on our own....against us rich bangksters and corrupted politicians...
We need to work harder as we are all Satoshi
Isn't it tue true vision of Satoshi Nakamoto ?🤔😏😎🤣

If tomorrow Twitter Google YouTube even Reddit see strong real likes and videos about BCH....
If Crypto or Crypterium see each months millions of dollars of BCH bought what will happen according to you...?


They will buy it !!

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency that shares many of the same characteristics as Bitcoin (BTC) yet also integrates a number of changes and features that set it apart. It is considered a 'fork' of Bitcoin, although proponents argue that Bitcoin Cash more closely adheres to the original vision of creating a peer-to-peer electronic cash system as laid out in a 2008 white paper written by the founder of the protocol, a person or group going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

&#x200B;

I will be straight : Bangksters+Institutionals bought BTC (spreading FUD in the same time), then pushed BTC under Light as a gold 2.0 using rotten medias and BTC maximalist.

These are some questions that I haven't found any answers to and am genuinely curious about.

1. Let's start off with what's probably the most controversial. What's the big deal with segwit? I don't really understand why it was so fiercely opposed. Certainly not because of block size concerns, seeing that Bitcoin Cash's max is far above anything remotely achievable with segwit. Nor could it be due to requiring a hard fork, because segwit is backwards compatible and requires no mandatory upgrade. I've only heard objective technical explanations of how it works and arguments *in favor* of using it, so I've yet to here the arguments against it. From what I understand, I don't really get why it's a big deal.
2. How is something such as smartbch fundamentally any different from something like segwit? (I understand the technical differences of how they work, rather I mean the ""purity"" of keeping to the principles of Bitcoin.) I would think that neither stray much from the whitepaper, or if they do, then equally so.
3. Is there anything in place to prevent segwit from being activated on BCH? It is backwards compatible after all, so theoretically there's nothing to stop it. What happens if people start to do so?
4. Somewhat unrelated question, but what are your thoughts on payment channels as a concept? I completely agree that the Lightning Network is terrible, but I think as a concept, payment channels have some good potential. For example, [there has been research relatively recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/qtxnnt/paper_of_sleepy_channels_bidirectional_payment/) that I found in the Monero community about payment channels which require neither complex scripts nor external watchtowers, and could work on any cryptocurrency. It would certainly not be a surprise to me if there are a lot more innovations to come.","self","https://redd.it/sih8qa"

Bangsters create money ex-nihilo demiurgic power...

They don't want Bitcoin.
They DON'T WANT IT and they will not let this arrive...crypto war or...buy it cause
""If you can beat your enemy join him""

We all know they bought BTC (spreading FUD in the same time) then they saw it is not the SN's vision and LN is not a real p2p electronish cash this is why they promote it instead trying to destroy it...

So...how BCH can win against a giant as BTC supported by hundred of billions dollars from bankgsters and institutionals ?

How onboard a country where politicians are puppets of Bangsters (need theirs millions to win election) or fear for theirs lives...?

Rotten medias they own never talk about real banksters they prefer talk about rich as Elon or Jeff but they never talk about ultra rich who organise their ""non-existence""  and poverty (divide between familly etc)


The only point i see is trying to spread the ""good news"" of BCH
Onboard etc
In order at some point bankgsters couldn't avoid this and will buy it...


Maybe onboard Elon Vitalik or Jeff could help ?
A plane showing BCH is Bitcoin in the sky above Elon's property could help him to got b*lls to acknowledge it...
My bet is...He knows it but fears bankgsters.","self","https://redd.it/sll0jd"

&#x200B;

The Bitcoin Core maximalists hate Bitcoin Cash. After all, they know that having low transaction fees is a threat to their holdings because they decided to sell their free fork, thinking that the people will not figure out that 32MB blocks don't compromise the network decentralization in any way or form. After all, hardware and internet connections are getting better and better each day.

Hi everyone, I am developing a card game to help newbies to learn about crypto and wanted to check with you guys the info I included about Bitcoin Cash, so I don't accidentaly embarras myself:

Altcoin or Token: Altcoin

Main usecase\*: Medium of Exchange

PoW or PoS: PoW

\*The included use cases of the game are: Medium of Exchange, Smart Contract Platform, Gaming and Metaverse, DeFi and Web3

Can you confirm that this contains no mistake?

Also, if you want to have a look at the designe and give me some (constructive) feedback, that would be very helpful!

Recently :

CEO of Uber said they will accept Cryptocurrency in the future but for now 

fees and CO² are a problem

&#x200B;

BCH got no fees (or so few) and consume 94% less CO² than BTC

This is why i tweet :

[https://twitter.com/AesonHeart/status/1492444393307086850?s=20&t=vEo83KjscHmlNBdlqbtFtA](https://twitter.com/AesonHeart/status/1492444393307086850?s=20&t=vEo83KjscHmlNBdlqbtFtA)

If you support my tweet and tweet UBER and the CEO maybe we got a chance he will use BCH

All people using BCH acknowledge it is far superior to BTC 

The most difficult part is they try it...

&#x200B;

I also ask to Roger Ver and Kim Dotcom to tweet him

They got strong voice mine is weak but we are all Satoshi and if people supporter of BCH were more invested to promote BCH it will be under lights

Bitcoin Cash has strived to be different and so far, well, it seems to be working. Just got wind that folks in St Kitts use and accept BCH virtually everywhere, to shops to grocery (prices are shown in BCH), even cabs and hospitals! Better yet, they are PAID in BCH... St Kitts being a country with no income tax, territorial tax, no capital gains tax and company operated outside no corporate tax. So you're quite literally seeing this applied properly and USED! Moreover, it would seem that other Caribbean islands are not messing about either and they're growing with their adoption (other ECD countries).   


BCH seems more developed in terms of payment processors and so forth as well and if you think Bitcoin is used as currency you're not really paying attention (something like 82% of people who have BTC don't do anything with it lol) and one final praise i'll give... there's 5 countries that offer citizenship by investment and St Kitts is one of them... I'm not sure the details but if some crypto geeks are doing the smart thing and 'cash'ing out, buying real assets and a passport being one of them (citizenship) then they are injecting more BCH into that economy to flow about (beats HODL'ing or whatever the hell is said).   


Ok, enough jerkin' about, as I said, I think cryptos are a bubble, a scam, an economic catastrophe, and unsustainable 'generally' and most will go away, unless they gain confidence (via utility). For the same efforts as BCH, i'm a huge fan of Monero (and more, in fact I only really appreciate XMR its just recently i've looked at Bitcoin Cash). The point being, these will have a propensity to stay and be adopted as long as confidence is attached to them and they have a direct purpose that is involving an economy (transfer of wealth which is only a product of goods and services, nothing more). BUT, having said that, How does Bitcoin Cash rectify the fact that it is transparent and therefore not only traceable (from wallet:wallet, transaction: transaction) but also non-fungible. In other words, each coin is not like the other and can be identified as so.   


Just wondering if there's any effort to get around this as we know the Feds have not only been watching, but the more successful this gets, the more they're gonna be coming for it.

My main goal is to provide a good QUALITY list without nonsense, as other review websites do - the best provider which pays the most for affiliates.

Cheap, Instant, and Secure transactions will win out over any other coin in a comparable interface. However, what does that interface look like today?

**Every Transaction Has To Be Confirmed In The Wallet Popup**

We've seen GREAT success in St. Kitts and other places where this is used for in-person transactions. However, the biggest successes for Bitcoin Cash online (the two blogging sites whose names will get this post flagged) use their OWN wallets, because (my argument is that) the best UX is the one where the in-app button click (tip/pay/like/etc.) does all the things (confirm recipient/calculates amount/broadcasts to the network/etc.). Is this not also how the chaintip bot works?

This is especially true for consumption sites where micropayments (the feather in the cap of BCH) are most desperately needed. Most other interactions could benefit from this model as well, but namely those that are repeatable on the same platform (imagine tipping for every upvote given on reddit, or every emote used on twitch)

So IF we accept that the in-app UX is best (and that is certainly up for debate as well), then we have to answer:

1. Do we trust app devs to all individually develop their own wallets for their own apps or
2. Would it be worth coming up with a protocol for app devs to use in order to interact with the established, already-secure BCH wallets in a way that did not require a popup?

I could be way off here, and the Bitcoin URI could be the best solution to what I perceive to be a UX problem, but I don't think so. Let me know if you think this could be better too, and if you think it's worth solving.","self","https://redd.it/sza2xs"

 From time to time, humanity experiences tragic events like earthquakes, tsunami's and other physical phenomena and even wars. Should the BCH community start an initiative to support the people in the affected areas? You may ask how. Well, I don't have a clear answer yet... 

The only thing that comes to my mind is something like the XNO's WeNano app (sorry for mentioning another coin in this thread) were we can start voluntary ""BCH spots"" in order the people in need to collect a specified amount of the nearest spot... 

In some countries, one dollar or even less, can make a huge difference, just imagine how helpful would be when everything around is destroyed...

📌Edit: Some people may have misunderstood this post.

Keep fighting the good fight.

That said I don't know of any verified and safe ways to directly donate crypto to help the displaced people of Ukraine, at least currently.

What I do know is the two most legit and helpful organizations that are helping, Red Cross and Doctors without borders do accept donations in credit/debit card and PayPal. Sadly it looks like PayPal doesn't allow you to send crypto.

Here is how Red Cross is helping Ukraine:
https://www.redcross.org/about-us/news-and-events/news/2022/ukraine-red-cross-delivers-aid-to-families.html

And here is the Red Cross donation Page: https://www.redcross.org/donate/donation.html/

Here is an update on Doctor without borders and how they are helping:
https://www.doctorswithoutborders.ca/country/ukraine-0

Doctor without borders donation Page:
https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/secure/donate

And with a word of caution be careful when surfing the web and looking good places to donate. There are a lot of scams popping up. Always double check the URL hasn't changed when visiting places to donate.

I found one myself when looking. Doctorswithoutborders.org ends with .org

But during my Google search doctorswithoutborders .care shows up and asks for crypto but it's a scam made to look like the official site.

So again be careful.

With that said, we'll be updating this post with any new information and places to potentially donate.","self","https://redd.it/t250p7"

Mandy was rescued yesterday by our team, Mandy received a very serious wound on her paw, which you assume was carried by a bad person who attacked her with a machete.

 Sensitive Content in this video!!! 

&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/t84q67/video/wixgl3oe1tl81/player

The amount of blood I lost was very large, so we acted immediately.

&#x200B;

She was transferred to the Nelve clinic, where her wound was treated immediately and her vital signs stabilized.

&#x200B;

Right now Mandy is in stable condition, however the wound on her leg is more serious than we think.

&#x200B;

The damage generated has endangered the mobility of her paw, so Mandy must undergo surgery and a wide range of therapies to recover a large percentage of the mobility of her paw, thus avoiding her amputation.

&#x200B;

The budget given has been 1.8 BCH to cover his surgery and much of his therapy.

We hope to prune as always with your support to save Mandy's mobility.

Our official wallet:

[https://tipb.ch/Bitcoincashanimalrescue](https://tipb.ch/Bitcoincashanimalrescue)

Today you will be performing again the treatments corresponding to her wound to avoid any type of infection and extra damage which hinders the whole process.

All this process as always we are publishing it in our tw official:[https://twitter.com/bchanimalrescue](https://twitter.com/bchanimalrescue) and through Reddit, for all those who wish to closely follow the process of recovery of Mandy, as well as several of our cases have followed previously.","self","https://redd.it/t84q67"

Mandy as we told you in the previous post, was rescued after having suffered an injury, provided by a bad person using a knife.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, even when we manage to control the wound and stabilize it for all the lost blood, Mandy is forced to undergo surgery.

The worst thing about this case is that really what we have left of time is very little, having only tomorrow to be able to save his paw.

Surgery and its subsequent treatments have a high cost, being a budget of 1.8BCH what we need to achieve it.

Otherwise, Mandy will have her paw amputated and she will live her whole life with a special condition.

We look forward to your support and showing the world the incredible things we can accomplish with BCH, save Mandy's life.

&#x200B;

All those people who wish to help us save it, can do so through our official wallet

Observation 1) The Bitcoin project has already been hijacked by Blockstream, likely with the backing of government actors. 2 years ago, I wrote about some evidence suggesting this at read.cash/@MobTwo/bitcoin-cash-is-under-attack-and-we-need-your-help-727c6939

I cannot think of anyone else so motivated as to waste money over the past 5 years trying to undermine the efforts of Bitcoin Cash. By now, it is obvious. BTC’s Lightning Network is collaborating with existing government actors such as World Economic Forum and BTC’s Lightning Network was listed on the World Economic Forum’s website. Cory Fields, a BTC developer, is working with the Federal Reserve to create a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency).

We could also see a shift in how banks and institutions, normally hostile towards cryptocurrencies are suddenly singing the praises of BTC. It is also not surprising to see traditional media and government employees singing the praises of BTC, since the US government has control over the project.

Observation 2) I was very disappointed about how the whole project derailed. I genuinely believe in the benefits of peer to peer money for the world. I was an idealist but I am also pragmatic. It is easy to criticize people like Adam Back or Cory Fields for working with the government. I would argue that good people will do bad things if being forced to.

Why would someone like Adam Back suddenly changed from supporting blocksize increase to sabotaging the project? Because if we were being coerced to do something, we would probably have done the same thing. The same way soldiers were made to commit war crimes and kill innocent children. I have no doubt many soldiers are good decent people, yet they will do bad things when they are being instructed to. It is hard to say no especially when the instructions are accompanied by coercion.

Observation 3) It is my opinion that the current crypto market is heavily manipulated by the fraudulent Tethers and their cartel of insiders. I could list down all the data points suggesting this but unfortunately, I’m just not interested enough to spend more time on this. If one were to spend enough time googling, it would be easy to find evidence of fraud all over Tether USDT.

Observation 4) An inflationary monetary system benefits the early recipients of those money while a deflationary monetary system benefits humankind. I won’t explain why money printing benefits the early recipients the most as this is a well covered topic already. But I will argue that when money is deflationary, people will spend their money much more carefully, buying only what they really want. I believe this will lead to less wastage and a huge drop in pollution globally, benefiting the planet and mankind as a whole. It is easy to be wasteful when money is inflationary and if you don’t consume, those money will become worthless over time. Obviously, we will spend them while there is still value.

And since governments can’t print money anymore, there will also be less wars since the war mongering governments can no longer print money to fund wars, wars which most people have little interests in. I’m not interested in seeing my money being spent to harm or kill someone from another country, absolutely no interest at all.

Observation 5) I would like to emphasize the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to humanity at https://slp.1bch.com/index.asp?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

I strongly believe in the value of Bitcoin Cash, even if it is just to preserve the freedom and liberty of people. That alone is valuable to me but of course, Bitcoin Cash is more than that. I genuinely believe that such a monetary system, separated from the government, can bring massive benefits to humanity, and I am willing to dedicate the rest of my life working on it, no matter what the price of Bitcoin Cash is.","self","https://redd.it/ta1zqz"

wild fire. Frightened, all the animals fled their homes and ran out of the forest. As they came to the
edge of a stream they stopped to watch the fire and they were feeling very discouraged and
powerless. They were all bemoaning the destruction of their homes. Every one of them thought
there was nothing they could do about the fire, except for one little hummingbird.
This particular hummingbird decided it would do something. It swooped into the stream and picked
up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire. Then it went back to the
stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again. All the other animals
watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, ""Don't bother,
it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it’s only a drop, you
can't put out this fire.""
And as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird’s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless
and forlorn they looked. Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a
mocking voice, ""What do you think you are doing?"" And the hummingbird, without wasting time or
losing a beat, looked back and said, ""I am doing what I can.""

After her surgery Mandy has presented a great evolution in her recovery, even when her hope was lost we did not give up and we managed to have her operated and we were allowed to pay the remaining 1.15 BCH to collect after her surgery.

Tomorrow Mandy will be able to start her therapies in order to recover a large part of the mobility of her paw, which makes us very happy as we continue to show the world how much we can achieve with Bitcoin Cash.

In the coming days we must pay the remaining debt, so those who wish to support us with this, in order to continue helping every day more as we usually do with our project, can do so through our official wallet.

Lately we have been in a difficult situation due to our limited economic resources, which every day do not limit when it comes to continuing with our project.

Our project has received gratifying support from the community, which we appreciate and this community is the one that has allowed us to save a large number of animals in serious situations.

However, today without resources and with a debt of approximately 1.3BCH pending for our last case, we are slowed down when it comes to continuing to provide help

Therefore we ask for your help, in order to solve this debt and be possible to have a fund to which we can resort for our activities for a good period of time.

For all those who want to support us with this and contribute their grain of sand in order to continue saving more lives every day with Bitcoin Cash, we thank you with all our heart

**Donate to our fund and allow us to cover our debt and save more lives:**

Voting has begun and will run for 3 days. The coin with more votes will move on to the next round to play the winner of: **2. Cardano** vs. **15. Aave**

For those unfamiliar, this is modeled after March Madness where the top 64 coins face off in a single elimination tournament. The winner moves on and the loser is out. The last coin left is declared the champion.

This is BCH’s third consecutive year in the tournament! Last year it fell in a hard-fought second round matchup to eventual champion EOS after defeating BitTorrent. The year before that it fell to Cosmos in the second round after defeating Nexo. Will BCH make the Sweet 16 this year? Tell your friends and maybe your frenemies; the more votes the better!

This is a real event, not spam and it’s just for fun. I know that different coins have different functions so it’s sometimes silly to ask “which is better,” but I’m still doing it because I think it’s fun. If this isn’t the type of post for this subReddit, I apologize and won’t post here again.

These 4 different multiplayer games (RPG, Strategy, Hybrids) will launch this year together. We had been working very hard on them for months already and didn’t want to talk about it until we are almost done.

Bear market? No problem, get through the tough times battling monsters and fight against the other players and the good times will come.

Remember Bitcoin Cash’s Hall of Fame? https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showHallOfFameFrame

It is missing lots of BCH folks (sorry!)! If you see someone’s name not in it (including your own), please write the name below and the contributions to the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem and we’ll add them in later.

You will encounter these non-playing characters inside the game! During your quests, you may encounter Marc De Mesel or Roger Ver or any of the folks from the BCH’s Hall of Fame. Some of them may even drop amazing loots!

And yes, you can spend and earn Bitcoin Cash in the games. The games will also feature tribes so Bitcoin Cash tribes can compete against the Ethereum tribes or Komodo tribes on the leaderboard. We want to bring everybody into the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem!

Having said that, our shoestring budget means that these games will be lacking aesthetically but we do everything we can to bring in new people into the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem, never mind such obstacles.

Join the 1BCH telegram group https://t.me/DeFi1BCHEnglish to get more updates from the 1BCH team!

And finally, I would like to give special thanks to Marc De Mesel. He may not realize this but without him, these 4 multiplayer games would not have happened. I am forever grateful to him.","self","https://redd.it/tfcvj6"

You can own a house in the game but lose your private key to someone else and that person can go into your house. You want to be a melee warrior or a mage spellcaster? It’s up to you. The game is heavily inspired by “The Lord of the Rings” series and so you’re likely to encounter characters from the series. You will also encounter characters from the Bitcoin Cash’s Hall of Fame.

If you’re not the type of person to roam the world alone, then the second game allows you to recruit troops and roam the open world. You can build different types of buildings and setup your base the way you like it. The objective is world domination, like Bitcoin Cash.

If you’re too lazy to roam around the world and just want to go straight to the action, then the third and forth game allows you to create your own Kingdoms. Wage wars against other Kingdoms managed by other players while forge alliances with fellow Bitcoin Cash folks. Don’t like the Bitcoin Maxis? Request your alliance to go after their Kingdoms! Let’s see which cryptocurrencies will dominate the leaderboard!

The third and forth game should be similar, except one is set in the medieval era while one is set in the modern era.

Obviously, the information here doesn’t describe the full games. Lots of details are missing. And most important of all, these are simple social games. Do not expect professional AAA budget games. It’s just a way to socialize and introduce new people to Bitcoin Cash in a fun way.","self","https://redd.it/tfnqc5"

Hello community first of all we want to thank you all because today thanks to a donation of 0.69BCH received anonymously, we are very close to being able to settle the 1.3 BCH that we have of debt in the clinic for the case of Mandy, of which we bring good news.

Which means that only 0.61BCH remains to be able to terminate this payment and be able to continue working our project with more peace of mind.

Mandy Case:

Mandy has shown great progress in his recovery which makes us very happy and shows that his medical and physiological treatments are working perfectly.

Today her bandage has been removed and a great healing has been seen in her wound, keeping her away from any risk of infection or relapse.

&#x200B;

According to medical forecasts, Mandy will have recovered 75% of the mobility of her paw in her first month of therapy, aspiring to the best result, 95% at the end of all her treatments, which is a gigantic achievement.

All this thanks to you and Bitcoin Cash.

Together with our allies at the Nelve clinic, the only and first animal clinic to receive BCH, with which we have worked the vast majority of our cases. We have planned the installation of a vaccination and medical care stand on this day in order to provide help and at the same time generate an adoption of Bitcoin Cash in the city.

&#x200B;

This stand, as you can see in the following illustration, will have a large amount of informative and instructive material on Bitcoin Cash and its community, with which we will seek to attract a large number of people to Bitcoin Cash.

We will have 2 qualified veterinarians who will be in charge of providing all the necessary medical assistance.

&#x200B;

Our aspiration is the vaccination and care of more than 250 animals, which will be distributed during the 5 days of this, which will start on April 5.

&#x200B;

As you can see, time is not on our side, however this is an opportunity to show the world how much we can achieve with BCH.

&#x200B;

Our goal is to collect 4BCH in order to meet the total goal.

&#x200B;

Be part of the adoption of Bitcoin cash.

We already have 5% of our goal.

Help us to participate and provide one of the largest adoption and medical assistance projects in our city.

In these 5 days that this project will last, the visit of approximately 2,000 people is aspired, to which in our BCHSTAND they will be provided with basic and strategic information of Bitcoin Cash in order to promote a gigantic adoption of Bitcoin cash in our city.

In turn, with our medical allies of the Nelve veterinary clinic, the first and a veterinary clinic in our city to accept Bitcoin cash, we will provide medical assistance and a vaccination day to all the aniamles that are taken to our location, thus achieving something incredible with Bitcoin Cash.

We have managed to reach 5% of the goal, there is still 3.90BCH of the necessary 4BCH, we hope to be able to count on your help.

Let's support the adoption of Bitcoin Cash in the world, let's achieve incredible things together

We already have 5% of our goal.

Help us to participate and provide one of the largest adoption and medical assistance projects in our city.

In these 5 days that this project will last, the visit of approximately 2,000 people is aspired, to which in our BCHSTAND they will be provided with basic and strategic information of Bitcoin Cash in order to promote a gigantic adoption of Bitcoin cash in our city.

In turn, with our medical allies of the Nelve veterinary clinic, the first and a veterinary clinic in our city to accept Bitcoin cash, we will provide medical assistance and a vaccination day to all the aniamles that are taken to our location, thus achieving something incredible with Bitcoin Cash.

We have managed to reach 5% of the goal, there is still 3.90BCH of the necessary 4BCH, we hope to be able to count on your help.

Let's support the adoption of Bitcoin Cash in the world, let's achieve incredible things together

Yesterday day I post about the the largest BCH adoption events in our city and at the same time provide medical attention to those animals that need it so much.

Some one called 3tmann sent us a donation

Today by the help of 3tmann and Bitcoin Cash technology we bought a house for Padro and Buffy 

Thanks you guys and thank you 3tmann 

We are still going to help more and more dogs 

By the end of this month we will release a documentary about how Bitcoin Cash technology helped many dogs

One important thing is that you can create wallets with any n-of-m schema there. It supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Binance Smart Chain and more.

Multisig wallet creation happens off-chain, a bit similar to how it is done in Bitcoin protocol. One advantage that threshold signatures gives is that transactions looks like a single user transaction, so group privacy is preserved.

In the nutshell it works the following way: all participants generate their own private keys, then they derive their respective public keys and share with others. The group public key is literally a sum of participants public keys. When they need to sign a transaction they calculate their individual share of r and s values of a signature. This way they literally can just sum up their signature shares and get a group signature. This approach is called multiplicative-to-additive transformation and is a scope of multi party computation (MPC).

It's the wait that requires community effort.

I don't think global adoption is going to happen without speculation and massive FOMO. Even smaller coins talk a lot about their price action, but such discussions seem to be completely abandoned in BCH. 


My thoughts: 

- FOMO is the main driving force behind crypto adoption, so without frequent pumps a coin is going to stay mostly irrelevant, regardless of its fundamentals.

- BCH people are crazy focused on shops and p2p adoption, but I think that's a wrong approach. Merchants aren't going to start easily accepting a volatile and complicated asset (complicated in a tax paperwork sense) if customers aren't acquiring and holding it first.

- For people/customers to buy BCH, they need to have a clear reason. Speculation and pumps is a clear and easy reason.

- For people/customers to hold BCH, it must be at least an inflation hedge. Or appreciate in price over long periods of time (""number go up""). Sadly BCH does neither. So people have no reason to buy, hold, and remove coins from circulation.","self","https://redd.it/tykmcx"

But honestly, why would I  be surprised? Crypto is not a small thing anymore and these kind of things should be expected. 

The problem is that, despite being a massive fan of crypto and a trader for a while now, I’m not sure if I want my reality based on a currency that is volatile all the time. I understand that this is a step forward, and it makes me happy, but I am also ambivalent. 

On one side, I want to see real world adoption here. I want us to have what places like Mexico and Pakistan have, or have e-commerce conducted with BTC or Exeno. Yes I want to see crypto being used for a real world application, but I am not sure if everyone here is yet. I’ve seen people here go nuts over small price increases, as they should, so I wonder how they will feel when BCH or BTC drops. How will all the angry people who had their money cut in half by crypto give crypto the negative PR it does not need right now? 

On the other hand, I am excited yes. As I said, I am a fan and a believer. Been here for a while and I’ve been dreaming of this moment. Not to mention the many advantages it will give the people.

Bitcoin Cash was a fork of Bitcoin due to a chain split when a certain group of Bitcoin developers wanted a change in Bitcoin’s overall scalability direction.

Even though these currencies share many similarities, they differ in the block size limit and transaction fees. Sending BCH on the network is cheaper than BTC, as Bitcoin Cash has bigger blocks and lower usage.

BCH is the 10th most used crypto on CoinGate, and 1% of all payments are made with Bitcoin Cash!

Right now due to war in Ukraine thousands of developers have lost their jobs. I with my fellow coworkers from Ukraine have created a community of mid to senior level developers (DeFi, web-dev, ML, etc.) of more than 1200 people. The main asset of our community is speed - we have a great team of PMs, so any task can be distributed between many people and can be done faster than you could imagine - motivation it is x)  
Now we are looking for outsourcing opportunities for them.  
If you have any suggestions of how to approach this problem or maybe even have some opportunities for them we, Ukrainians, will deeply appreciate it!

I had arranged a video call with /u/pahalie and I can confirm some things based on the video call. He is a Ukrainian and he is helping people in Ukraine to have income. I am very proud of what he's doing.

They accept crypto payments, including Bitcoin Cash, so if you guys have something relevant to outsource to them, please consider doing so. In addition, I am going to speak to my government officials to see if my country can do more to help these people directly (and connect them with OP). This may be something that you can do as well. Together, with enough people, we can do lots of good.

Can de-fi and centralized finance coexist? If China is the model for their ambitions, then no.

My hunch is that they're feigning superficial acceptance of de-fi while taking control of the on- and off-ramps before a global market crash compels nations to move into a central-bank crypto currency.","self","https://redd.it/ud34b3"

Hundreds of people from both Venezuela and international tourists visit Galipán to disconnect from the city and thus be able to have closer contact with nature.

Galipan is a small town located on the northern slope of Cerro el Ávila (currently called ""Waraira Repano""), specifically in the Macuto parish of La Guaira state, Venezuela. It is famous for its flower farms, restaurants and very picturesque inns. It is a perfect destination to share with family or friends, and thus be able to enjoy the wonderful cold weather that is difficult to achieve in the city.

""Recorriendo Galipán"" is in charge of organizing tourist trips and transfers in said locality, and also offering transportation service for those who require it, at incredible prices. Today Deysi Oropeza, the CEO of this venture, decided to join the free economy and take a step forward in her town, saying YES to the adoption of Bitcoin Cash within her tourist packages and services.

This is hard work that the BCH Latam team is doing in Venezuela and that it intends to expand to more Latin American countries in 2022.

**The use cases are countless:**  
\- Retailers can create their **own customer retention system** within minutes and without initial costs.  
\- Merchants can create and sell **gift voucher** tokens to their customers which they can send digitally to family members or friends as presents.  
\- Farmers in developing countries could **tokenize their future harvest** and raise capital through the community **without the involvement of banks or loan sharks**.  
\- Airbnb hosts could tokenize the availability of their properties.  
\- Groups of investors could **tokenize real estate** by minting tokens that represent fractional ownership of a property.  
\- Any community could create its own **unique payment system** almost instantly.  
    
You can already have a **sneak peek of the UI/UX** at the telegram group (pinned message).  
Why take this route? Because SLP transactions require BCH as ""gas"", meaning that every SLP wallet is also holding BCH.

In the second step (2023), we will engage in a massive **influencer ad campaign** to put the app into the hands of millions of users, because they are the multipliers. Their thousands of different use cases are what will eventually contribute to the consolidation of BCH and its increase in market cap.

How to buy:

First you would need to get Bitcoin from a BTC atm (if they dont take ID in your country) or localbitcoins is a option too, but with localbitcoins you gotta be careful to only deal with people that have reputation. Then use non-KYC crypto swap sites such as [https://switcheroo.to](https://switcheroo.to) or any other exchanges that focuses on anonymity. As far as I know, it even says in their TOS that they will never ask for any identifying information.

How to sell:

It would be the same idea as above, but just selecting your cryptocurrency on [https://switcheroo.to](https://switcheroo.to) or any other then swapping to any of your preferred cryptocurrencies.

Hope that was helpful to any of you.","self","https://redd.it/ulxnjd"

1.2 / 0.00900075 BCH = $133.32 Per 1 BCH

BCH market price is currently $203.

Thats an $69.68  discount per BCH.

So BCHG has a 52.65% discount below spot ($69.68 / $133.32 = 52.65%)

If the SEC really does convert the fund to an ETF the BCH will be able to be withdrawn and sold at the correct market price. So for every $1 you put in, you get $1.53 of BCH.

If you wondered where Celsius and others like NEXO get their interest rates from, it seems it was also UST plus investing in Ethereum, so crypto exposure for your USD loans.

With various effective recruitment through talks, events and training, we managed to educate many people interested in knowing about Bitcoin Cash in this city.  

Maracaibo is characterized as one of the busiest cities in Venezuela for its commercial activity, thanks to the fact that it is located on the border between Venezuela and Colombia.  

We managed to carry out 4 effective events, where we were able to teach the fundamentals of BCH and the most important thing, which is how to adapt it to your daily life through the wallet.  

Not least, we give a training to future Bitcoin Agents who, thanks to the support of [Angel Hermoso](https://twitter.com/Angelhbchlatam) and [Darwin Ramirez](https://twitter.com/darwinramirez09) in their city, we know they will do excellent.  

Great work team during these 3 days in Zulia State, where the work of [Jaifred Pastran](https://twitter.com/Pastranve), [Andrea Méndez](https://twitter.com/Soyandreamendez)and [Rafael Mogollón](https://twitter.com/MogollonRafaelE) also stands out. We hope that this work carried out will increase in the short term to continue massifying the use of Bitcoin Cash not only in Venezuela, but in more Latin American countries.

# Bitcoin Cash has been producing new opportunities for people worldwide; you don't have to be rich to use it. With as little as one penny, you can have your account funded and running in no time without having to ask for permission from third-party service providers like Wallet of Satoshi or Strike. Bitcoin Cash is and will continue to be the real Bitcoin that first works as a peer-to-peer currency. And it will become the next programmable money second and store of value because it does its first mission well and cheaply; the other two functions will come as a result of the first.

It is a ReadCash article, I am using Twitter to post the link.

I was unaware that that was even a thing or even existed. I thought you could only tip moons.

That being said,  I'm going to figure it out and pay it forward and tip someone else some BCH and hope I make their day.

Hey guys, I'm the guy running crypto for the homeless. We recently just had our 3 year anniversary (4/28/19 start date) a couple months ago - this post is a little bit late.

For those of you who don't know, crypto for the homeless (CFTHL) is a non-profit organization I created with the intention of doing something unique with crypto while at the same time helping the needy.

I started it completely out of pocket at the start and was able to get the organization of its feet immediately due to the massive support shown from social media (mainly reddit).

I never set out to ""solve"" homelessness, as I think that is a systemic problem that even governments can not fix - but rather to re-introduce a human aspect of charity that I felt was sorely missing from most other projects (at least in my opinion).

We differentiated ourselves by utilizing all of the funds we received thus far on food/goods for the homeless, and also delivering food straight to the homeless/needy. In addition to this, we have photo documentation of all food hand outs as well as receipts dating back to the very first time we handed out food (3+ full years of photos at this point) which I believe no other charity has come close to doing.

While we had very humble beginnings, we are proud to have 501c3 status for 2+ years now, and also recently launched our brand new website [http://cryptoforthehomeless.com](http://cryptoforthehomeless.com/) (check it out).

We also have had a massive amount of volunteer support (people buy and hand out food for us and get reimbursed in crypto). Our partners in New Zealand have been doing the most amazing work consistently for us and I could not be prouder. [https://imgur.com/a/cBoAUNg](https://imgur.com/a/cBoAUNg) \- here is an album of some of their recent work.

In terms of donations, we have received enough (roughly $75,000 thus far) to last us probably a decade or more of work at our current rate (if we ration the spending to maintain our current rate), which I view as a massive success and also a guarantee of our longevity.

I've learned a ton from running this project thus far - and I've used a lot of it to try and improve the project if possible.

1. It is impossible to satisfy 100% of people with ANY project - for this one in particular, there are those who oppose helping homeless people in general and thus they will inherently hate this project no matter what I do.
2. It is impossible to make this project 100% ""trustless"" despite what most people who have that criticism say. It is ultimately a project based on human work, and the best that I/we can do is provide a massive amount of proof of work (which we have) that should be used as a basis of our legitimacy. At this point, having 3+ years of photos as well as documenting over $20,000 donations in monero should be more than enough proof of our legitimacy (in addition to reimbursing 100% of our volunteers who participated properly).
3. A lot of people want to steer the project in many different directions - ultimately the project's design is a very personal thing when it comes down to it. I personally created it with a very specific vision in mind - and that may not align with what you(or other people) feel the best vision is. That is perfectly fine - and you/they are free to create a project to carry out that vision in the same way I have carried out mine. Projects like this cost time/money and the very fact that enough supporters on the internet have funded this project to last us 10+ years now at least shows that we have a reason to exist. I am beyond grateful for this support and intend to respect the intentions of our donors for the extreme long term.

Which brings us to future plans -

We currently have a couple people including myself dedicating quite a lot of time each day working on the websites/social media/communicating with volunteer prospects/etc. There are actually a lot of things that occur behind the scenes that are very time consuming and we could use 1 or 2 more people working with us on the team on various things (social media/engagement/etc). This is one of our top priorities right now - so if this is something you can see yourself doing - please reach out to me, even if the amount of time you can commit is small!

Also, as I have stated earlier - we are proud of the fact that all of the funds thus donated to us have been entirely dedicated to the buying and reimbursing of food/goods for the homeless (and I intend to keep it that way). One repeated suggestion that I have had was to pay our employees for their time, even minimal. Because of our pledge to not use the funds for that purpose at the start, we had to come up with a different solution which is as follows:

[https://www.flowcode.com/page/lmcfthl](https://www.flowcode.com/page/lmcfthl) \- these are wallets we set up for the sole purpose of optional support to provide our employees (again this is just to have the option there - we absolutely do not require anything to continue to operate, but if you want to support the employees that have been working completely free since the start this is the way to do it).

That about sums it up for now - I hope we met/exceeded the expectations of those of you who have followed us from the beginning - if not, we will try even harder going forward. Feel free to post any and all criticism/suggestions/support/anything and we will take it all in!","self","https://redd.it/vbqn9m"

So they resort to censorship on forums. Somehow billionaires and companies with billions in loans all flocked to it and are now majorly at huge losses that they cant offload onto anyone.

Even If Bitcoin doesnt go down, eventually microstrategy for example will have to close their position at huge losses. Margin call is bad for them, but so is just being in a bad trade using billions in loans.

Its just such a simple basic thing to realize that small blocks do not make sense. Big blocks are simple and so obvious. Do we use 1mb floppy disks today? Or massive SSD's?....

Speculators in Bitcoin are waiting for more new companies to offer 20% APR and then use all the money to pump Bitcoin. Its a terrible mechanism and might not occur.

Utility will win in the long run over the ponzi scam methods.

Big blocks actually work and can add utility to the world to compete with FIAT. FIAT has a built in tax called inflation.

Bitcoin-Cash (BCH), has that utility, which will win in the long run. Adoption has occured in places where they actually care about having low fees for regular spending such as in Queensland in Australia and many islands in the Caribbean.

Now we are finally hearing about all the companies who propped up Bitcoin against BCH and made it seem like Bitcoin won.

Now they are all bankrupt and we are finding out besides the massive loans many took out, they also used their users funds to gamble on Bitcoin without their consent.","self","https://redd.it/vek9dp"

Over time as the industry matures, maybe some big players will begin to realise this. This coin has all the benefits of what Bitcoin used to be and what ETH is now without the fees and congestion! 

This last rally was not a rally on fundamentals, it was purely hype. I asked my friends on what coins they bought and then I asked for their knowledge about the coin and they didn’t even know what the coin does or the fundamentals of the coin. I found this to be shocking.

Hopefully over time the greater crypto community will come to appreciate fundamentals and real world utility of coins such as BCH.

In the current market 5% return is not worth losing 100% of your coins.

This also may explain why BCH is not following Bitcoin and we see huge buy walls on all western exchanges. The naked BCH shorts may be underwater and unable to close without you selling your BCH to them.

Edit:

>1) BTW they say ""minimize any downside"" which means there was a downside that they couldnt avoid, they just ""minimized it"", we could be talking tens of billions in losses and they could still use these words.

# We all need money, and that money must be neutral from political influence and have scarcity that it can hold value over time, and it must be usable in trade without much friction. In the current market, we have many currencies competing to be that, one being Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and others. Still, we must not forget that if you sell and concentrate only on the fiat value, eventually, the corporations that print that fiat currency will deprive you of your home and your new-found wealth, Bitcoin, and all other cryptocurrencies.

BTC supporter;  

It does not matter how often you say to yourself that BCH is the real bitcoin; it is not.

 BCH supporter;

Please send me one penny on BTC as I did with BCH, and see what the real Bitcoin can do.

BTC supporter;  

lol, dude... less than a penny... keep ignoring the LN

BCH supporter:

 

Wallet of Satoshi or Chivo, aka banker's Bitcoin, not real Bitcoin. Fake Bitcoin and probably even fractional reserve Bitcoin. Because opening my channel will cost at least 0.001 BTC on liquidity plus, opening the channel and closing with routing fees on top.

I am sure one penny won't be enough to do all that.

Once again, I will send another penny. Maybe you can guess what works and what doesn't.

A real Bitcoin means I can send you a $0.01 value without worrying about fees; that real Bitcoin is its BCH, not central banks Bitcoin BTC.

Syncing a full node or server from scratch requires an **IBD** (**I**nitial **B**lock **D**ownload) which might be too difficult for some people's Wi-Fi, without constantly disconnecting & reconnecting. Also, dodgy adapters stop working overnight, until they're reset in the morning. This script can solve the problem, however ssh tunnels (e.g. for port forwarding) are more difficult to re-activate.

I'm being censored from both r/btc ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vxegwy/batch_script_to_automate_resetting_wifi_in_win10/)) & r/Bitcoin ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/vxy7ol/batch_script_to_automate_resetting_wifi_in_win10/)). I've also been censored from the official coinflex\_EN TeleGram channel, after I couldn't withdraw my **$8k** worth of coins from CoinFlex (formerly bitcoin.com exchange). Instead of `Ping`, my earlier scripts used `PowerShell (Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing www.msftconnecttest.com/connecttest.txt).Content`

To use the script, copy-paste into Notepad & save as *MaintainInternetConnection.bat*. Replace ""Wi-Fi"" with the name of the network connection. Then right-click & *Run as Administrator*. `netsh interface set interface` requires Admin. `cd` & `FindStr` pretty up the output.

This script is inspired by Try3's batch script over at [TenForums](https://www.tenforums.com/network-sharing/142903-how-automate-resetting-adapter.html). I've also posted it there. Unfortunately his was less efficient & used too much CPU due to its use of PowerShell. His comments state:

>​::   This procedure continually tests for an internet connection using the  same test that the TaskBar network icon \[""Network Connection Status   Icon"", NCSI\] uses - the ability to find [www.msftconnecttest.com/connecttest.txt](http://www.msftconnecttest.com/connecttest.txt)  
>  
>:: This internet connection test applies to Windows 10 Versions 1607 & later...

It'd be faster to disconnect & connect, rather than disable & enable the interface, but unfortunately I don't know simple code to do that. OpenSSH connections might also have to be reset.","self","https://redd.it/vytl65"

If Bitcoin is to succeed, it won't be on a high racketeering fees structure and must be on cheap transactions. It must be with your private keys and not custodians. If the government goes after cash, they will go after cryptos, and any amount of cryptos held with custodians can be seized at any point. It is a possibility just waiting to happen.

First of all an apology for the delay of this event, unfortunately for health problems I had not been able to hold this event that we had scheduled for July 5, but better late than never.

Today with  I'm happy to announce that I has started a small project which I am sure that over time it will be able to scale to something bigger and bigger and generating an incredible adoption in our community.

THE ADOPTION BCH GAME HAS BEGUN.

 First of all I want to thank several of the people who donated to increase the prize which initially started with only 30$ managing to increase it to 50$ in BCH. Mr. [u/moleccc](https://www.reddit.com/u/moleccc/) Mr. EtherBalance and several people who showed their support for my project as Mr. [u/emergentcoding](https://www.reddit.com/u/emergentcoding/)

This game begins with 4 posters, located in 4 very important points and traveled especially on foot through my city, these cards and the following ones were also glued and later covered in their entirety with transparent tape to prevent them from being torn off or suffering some type of damage from the rain or something similar.

These first 4 posters stand out for their main and attractive title which invites people to play to get the prize of $ 50 in BCH, they also have 4 QR codes!

Code 1. The track, this is a location which shows you where the following sign is located.

Code 2. This code redirects you to the [Bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com/) page so that people can download their BCH wallet.

Code 3. This code takes you to the [Whybitcoincash.com](https://whybitcoincash.com/) page in order for the person to know more about Bitcoin cash.

Code 4. This code redirects the person to the two most important subreddits of Bitcoin cash [r/BitcoinCash](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinCash/) and [r/BTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/BTC/)

 The player must take a photo of each poster, to show that he has managed to find each and every one of them, through the player will advance the posters will be hidden many more and the locations put in the QR codes will not be so precise in order to give more intensity to the game.

At the end of the game, the user must write to the email that is written on the last poster and this email must send the photo of each of the posters to confirm that the game is complete, in addition to sending your BCH wallet also, once the prize is confirmed it will be deposited immediately.

At the moment we only have the money to have a single winner, we would like to have at least 5 winners so that those who complete the game do not run out of any type of prize, but at the moment it is impossible because I do not have those resources.

Once the winner is confirmed I will upload a post, so see you soon friends!","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/SzPf7ZxQMEGmbDC5p9ZNv2NNppQD5gK5befurzif58k.jpg","https://redd.it/w2rnc1"

Bitcoin Cash is the Bitcoin that works and that you don't need any central authority to use; it is in fast money, and it works just like Bitcoin did just before 2017. Bitcoin Cash is not a fork of Bitcoin. It is indeed Bitcoin and has Satoshi's coin in its blockchain. It may seem like BCH is a fork of BTC, but it is not.

You can be right about Bitcoin Cash being the real Bitcoin, but you can be wrong in its timing and, as such, lose a lot of money in the process. When I say that Bitcoin Cash will take over Bitcoin Core BTC, I mean that BCH will have more acquiring power against any other asset, either fiat currency or Bitcoin Core itself, but it won't happen without pain.

I'll try keep this updated in coming days. **27GiB** memory needed for VirtualBox (debian) at block height 709k, & I've got 43k more blocks to process. At up to **2k/day** that's 3 more weeks of syncing! My NVMe™ [WD Green 2TB](https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Green-SN350-Internal/dp/B09DVRBNWV) should degrade a couple more percent. I've adjusted config files to remove limits on memory & timeouts. The Read:Write ratio overall is about **6:1**, & Windows is a separate drive.

I find memory degradation interesting because it's a whole new expense - like an electricity bill! I'd guess that to fully index a big-block blockchain would cost more in NVMe™ SSDs than in electricity. If a $140 chip degrades 2 or 3%, then that's at least **$3** just to sync SLPDB, even with small blocks. (I got it for about $123, though.) Even copy-pasting the BCH blockchain costs at least a few cents. (**Edit**: Up to $8 may be calculated assuming 1200TBW warranty on a $200 chip, since memory % degradation increases as remaining memory cells decrease.)

[SLPDB](https://github.com/simpleledger/SLPDB/releases/tag/1.0.0) uses SLPJS which should use my [bchdtrustedvalidator](https://github.com/simpleledger/slpjs/blob/master/lib/bchdtrustedvalidator.ts), but instead it seems to be taking ages. If my BCHD ([tinos.ml](https://tinos.ml)) is trusted, then it shouldn't take long to collate all the SLP data.  🤔

An example flexUSD address I like to watch has true balance **0**, but [simpleledger.info](https://simpleledger.info/address/simpleledger:qrg7e8p3m8zh5h6mf4xrqxppkr4kguzf8y68plu2tz) won't show it. We get the following balances from the slpdb instances - all wrong & all different:

Comparing the WD Green to [WD Black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QV5KJHV?ref=emc_p_m_5_i&th=1) \- on a desktop PC two green chips (**$280** Amazon price) could be combined into **4TB** faster than the 2TB Black chip ($200), faster in random-access (RAM) speed. However some laptops only have a single slot available. Only the black chip comes with a good warranty, though, so official cost calculations can't necessarily be based on the green one I like. Unofficially 2 green chips might last much longer than a single black one. As I mentioned in my last Reddit [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/wgxg9w/commands_to_strip_bitcoin_bchd_executables/) I'm waiting for a \~$50 used PC upgrade to arrive with faster PCIe slots, & I might order 2x16GB 1600MHz RAM sticks, compared to my current **4x4GB** 1333MHz, except that faster RAM is for graphics! (Edit: Apparently Samsung might [out-perform](https://versus.com/en/samsung-970-evo-plus-2tb-vs-western-digital-wd-black-sn750-2tb) WD Black.)

(Aside: PCIe x1 adapters may be a potential fire hazard, since they seem to fit in better the opposite way around on an x16 slot, if the bracket's been removed. I accidentally destroyed a $25 SSD this way, & there was a lot of **smoke** coming out the back of my PC! It's like plugging USB in upside down & burning the device. Another issue is that there's M & B key NVMe™, which are like righties & lefties, & I even bought an incorrect adapter!)","self","https://redd.it/wio4c1"

After my Bitcoin cash search game, which was pleasantly received by the community and I thank you for it.

I have taken on the task of designing and planning this new project.

What will be the basis of this? It will consist of 6 banners, which will be of a considerable size and attractive to the public eye, these will be positioned in 6 important points of my city.

https://preview.redd.it/x4e7zmokdzg91.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc4c7c89d3fb65c3da8b1f996f0222142581350b

 These banners will be divided into 4 dynamic and simple steps as you can see.These steps will motivate anyone who sees it to:  


1. Download their Bitcoin Cash Wallet.
2. Know and learn more about Bitcoin cash.
3. Be part of our core communities on Reddit.
4. Know BCH sub-projects and invite more people to be part of this project.

&#x200B;

[Here you can see an example of how some of these positioned would be \(Sorry for the edition, I am not an expert\)](https://preview.redd.it/cqk9bfzmdzg91.png?width=698&format=png&auto=webp&s=221a8a1b2a6bbf2c0c4f6234f8f1818429f45a67)

The points where these banners will be positioned are places where hundreds of people are treated daily, so the expectation with this project is very great.

1.45 BCH are necessary to carry out this project, so once I manage to collect them, I will start this project.

As with my previous project, I will make a post showing the results.

I thank the community for their constant support, let's keep working for Bitcoin cash!","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BvZ3mC1JdqDawCjhyz9c1vGmy3ZTSqN0R7w-Sk9BxHc.jpg","https://redd.it/wldu4w"

What we see is that we have a lot more people actually using Bitcoin Cash and this causes some conflicts. Are advertisements for companies that sell things for Bitcoin Cash Ok? Are people receiving Bitcoin Cash for something unrelated Ok? What about some company integrating Bitcoin Cash into its existing product? (Answers: Once, No, Depends).


The mods have been talking about this and we converged on a vision that in essence embraces the growth and therefore has to tighten the focus in order to avoid becoming irrelevant.

Or, in plain English, we want to keep the focus on Bitcoin Cash value-producing topics. On research about the chain, on the software that is needed to use the chain and so on.

What we want to ask people to limit posting about is stuff that simply uses Bitcoin Cash.

Specifically:

* companies and projects that sell things for Bitcoin Cash can post those, to attract more customers. Think on-boarding posts, Internet projects accepting it etc. But don't expect us to approve of you posting repeatedly that one store or website and us becoming your advertisement channel.
* Flipstarters or other such infractions of the rule 2 (don't beg for Bitcoin) are only allowed if they are specifically for Bitcoin Cash projects. This means when your project goals are adding value to the Bitcoin Cash community. Still, things like silly amounts and unverified developers asking for funds is likely going to cause a removal. Mods will review this with care with the goal to avoid abusing our readers.
* The one project that keeps being posted a lot which [is not a Bitcoin Cash project](https://read.cash/@BitcoinCashMods/time-to-be-honest-about-smart-bch-6f5b0acf) is smart-bch. This is a different chain and just like we remove BTC relevant posts, we will remove sbch ones. There are specific subs for those other chains.


Specifically allowed here are:

* Discussions re-posted from rBtc which are about Bitcoin Cash.
* Project updates as long as the projects try to add value to Bitcoin Cash.
* Cool stuff that happened to you in the real world while paying or promoting Bitcoin Cash! Also not so cool stuff, if you want a shoulder.
* Links to videos, podcasts or other which specifically talk about Bitcoin Cash and do not have as their main topic the price or investing.


We hope this clarifies things and avoids frustration and we hope people will be posting more now they know it will be appreciated here.

Cheers, the bitcoin-cash mod team.","self","https://redd.it/x1pkts"

I took a few days of rest and reflection after not being able to reach the goal of the BCH Latam flipstarter. 

&#x200B;

Despite the results obtained, the entire BCH Latam team remains committed to continue providing education and quality content to consumers and merchants, in order to massify the use of Bitcoin Cash across borders.

Very soon we hope to present another plan, in order to continue fulfilling our work within the community.

Of particular interest are countries with an active community - regular meetups, merchants, perhaps even individuals being paid in crypto, and of course the builders creating the apps that we all enjoy!

There are a couple of places that I know about:

1. Bangkok (I know some other Youtubers have already been here, so please tell me if it deserves a revisit)
2. Bangalore (Not actually SEA, but they Just opened a Bitcoin Cash Cafe. Sunny was there and onboarded a few other businesses, but I don't know much besides that.)
3. Singapore (It is the hub of finance in Asia, but I don't know of any particular BCH community there)
4. Taiwan (I actually came across this account today: [https://twitter.com/twbitcoincash](https://twitter.com/twbitcoincash) I loved visiting TW back in 2017 and would return to see what's up with Bitcoin Cash (and to enjoy delicious food and to bike on the luscious east coast of the island)
5. Philippines (Those of you on [Noise.Cash](https://Noise.Cash) and [Read.Cash](https://Read.Cash) already know, but there are a lot of Filipinos on these platforms, and I'm hoping that the Bitcoin map is outdated because the amount of businesses displayed there seems really low for this level of enthusiasm!)

- A decent and simple to use wallet. Should support BCH but support for other coins are okey. 
- best way to convert fiat currency to BCH without using a KYC exchange. Just because. I might do a couple 100 dollars worth. Nothing big so no huge volume needed. 

Only because I want to use it for buying simple stuff like ice creams and used items without my taxes going complete bananas due to all transactions. And also as an emergency fund if the world gets more fucked up. 

Think consider ledger nano s plus, but realized having another item is just a hindrance for daily use. 

I know a lot of this can be solved by searching and DYOR, but I won’t get real life testimonials from that.

It all looks good. Confirmed whole 9 right.

Then later that day the same amount is sent out to a address that I do know. I looked at the TX I followed it but in confirms on the network as it should but obviously I don't know the owner.
BitPay> BCH

I was able to follow to wallet : qrcpagya0hgch3744xxzg5wvlrkshmvrmcd4r5xcss

Then it starts splitting up the transactions.

So is this what I think it is?

I'm bipolar and was having a rough day that day. Did I do something without knowing or was someone else able to access that account?

I checked my other wallet's and my cold ones don't have BCH on them.

I'm I over looking something?

BTW I've NEVER sent ANY token out of this wallet.

BCHG (OTC) shares has a 36% discount to spot BCH price.","Discussion",0.8,12,0,0,5,0,"Many who own BCH dont know that there are high paying Yields for this crypto currency. 

**Option 1:** 

https://www.gemini.com/earn

There are many traders who are paying top dollar to Borrow BCH and play the markets (gamble basically). They either make way more than their interest rate, or lose way more.

If you dont know how to play the markets, you can take the safer option and lend for interest, to Genesis through Coinbase earn for 5.5% (5.33% daily interest, cumulatively is actually 5.5% if you dont withdraw your earnings)

Pros: Easy to withdraw. Daily interest. Very liquid.

Cons: Rate can change, either higher or lower in the future.

**Option 2:**

https://grayscale.com/products/grayscale-bitcoin-cash-trust/

Ticker: BCHG an OTC stock run by grayscale. They are holding BCH on Coinbase custody, and are selling BCH 36% below their face value. This is because for now they are not allowing the BCH to be withdrawn, they are trying to convert it to an ETF which would allow withdrawals, or they can simply enable withdrawals in the future if they choose to do so (Im not sure why they arent already).

This rate is 6 and a half times the yearly interest of Gemini earn. So if it becomes an ETF before 6.5 years you still get paid the full yield. 

Pros: 6.5 years of 5.5% locked in even if they allow withdrawals earlier, then you just take it out and lend it somewhere else for more interest. Rates cant drop because its locked in.

Cons: to withdraw your profits, they have to either become an ETF, or enable withdrawals, or the market price has to reach parity with spot. You are assigning a 6.5 year window for this at a 5.5% interest rate. If its longer it might have been better to just lend elsewhere","self","https://redd.it/yjdwnb"

This matches the Bitcointalk user ""Loaded"". He famously vowed to dump his BCH on u/memorydealers. He signed a message to verify ownership of 40k BTC:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/60ozkh/rogerver_lets_make_a_deal_1_for_1_trade_at_least/

From the court documents:

>Individual-1 received a matching amount of a related cryptocurrency—50,000 Bitcoin Cash (“BCH Crime Proceeds”)—on top of the 50,000 Silk Road BTC. Individual-1 thereafter exchanged through an overseas cryptocurrency exchange all of the BCH Crime Proceeds for additional Bitcoin, amounting to approximately 3,500 BTC

>...

>During the Search, law enforcement also recovered Individual-1’s laptop containing detailed ledgers spelling out cryptocurrency transactions of assets configured in 40,000 and 10,000 blocks

>...

>On or about March 25, 2022, counsel for Individual-1 surrendered to the Government 825.38833159 BTC

That matches this address:

https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qmxjefnuy06v345v6vhwpwt05dztztmx4g3y7wp

The 40k BTC input in that address easily traces back to the address in Loaded's signed message.

As an art collector, I think this nft thing is hooey, but that is my personal 2¢.

Anyhow... 
I was interested in giving my customers for my small business more options to pay, and I have another side gig with a band, and somebody asked if they could tip with some  app (i don't remember)

But do not worry if you feel like you bad off. Micheal Saylors MicroStrategy is way worse off their bitcoin investment than arguably any other person right now.

MicroStrategy owns roughly 130.000 BTC thats is worth a massive $2.2b right now. But as the price is at roughly at $16k right now they are in some massive loss. Their average buying price is about $30,369k, meaning they bought 130k BTC at the worth of about $4b. Thats put them up for roughly $1.8b unrealized losses. (unrealized, because they obviously did not actually sell it at a loss.

Furthermore, Tesla, Block and Microstrategy had a combined $5b losses in Q2 of this year, until Tesla sold 75% of their holdings.

So you truly don’t have to feel bad as there are companies out there that are sitting on billions of losses and ever-increasing impairment costs for their holdings, but they are not selling.","self","https://redd.it/yuummt"

If I understand correctly, there are only 21 million coins and there will only ever exist 21 million. Is that correct? If not, correct me in the comments and stop reading. Because of I’m wrong about that, then the rest of this is bunk.

Ok, side track for a second. When the US needs to fund a natural disaster or a war or whatever, it just makes more money. That means that valuable stuff goes up in price because there is now more money than stuff.

See where this is leading?

If there is a fixed amount of money, then stuff should decline as a percentage of that money as the money becomes more distributed right?","self","https://redd.it/yuxqnk"

But they did have BCH trading pairs, for spot, futures and perpetual funds.

Now what they did was:

1) FTX shorts BCH below other exchanges spot and futures prices. - **WE SAW FOR MONTHS FUTURES WERE TRADING MULTIPLE % BELOW SPOT**.

2) Market makers **Deposit collateral onto FTX** to buy FTX's fake paper BCH at a cheap price and then short BCH at a higher price on other normal exchanges. This is **supposedly ""FREE ARBITRAGE""**. All they have to do is hold until the contract expiration, and they profit the difference in price between FTX and other exchanges.

3) FTX goes bankrupt. The market makers no longer have any long BCH positions because FTX never had any BCH, and instead the market makers only have short BCH positions on other exchanges.

4) If the price of BCH rises all these market makers stand to lose Hundreds of millions and get margin called and/or go bankrupt. 

5) Evidence: After FTX went bankrupt futures prices not only lost their negative premium but they actually have gone above spot ever since. That is evidence that FTX may have been behind this. To encourage traders to short BCH spot and buy FTX BCH paper futures for free 2-5%.

We know Binance and OKX trade against their own customers, these are the largest Futures exchanges. They might be the largest short positions as well because they cant be margin called on their own exchanges, so they really thought it was free arbitrage. This could explain why Binance had over 450k BCH liabilities but only 100K BCH: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/yrhvvt/binance_just_admitted_that_they_owe_611919_bch_to/

They might have bought 350k BCH on FTX and shorted the 350k BCH of their customer BCH deposits.

Now FTX is bankrupt and admitted they dont have any BCH, Binance owes their customers 350k BCH that they do not own anymore.

Just to give an easy example:

1) FTX sells BCH to $100 while other exchanges have BCH priced at $105.

2) Binance sees this and buys futures paper BCH for $100 and sells their customer deposits of BCH for $105. Now they have a paper $5 profit from this, if they can get their $100 BCH out of FTX when the futures contract expires.

3) FTX goes bankrupt. Binance loses the $100 BCH, but has the $5 profit left. Their debt is 1 BCH rather than $100 dollars though, so if they have to buy hundreds of thousands of BCH, each BCH might cost over $200-$300.

This information also explains why FTX Sam reached out to Binance and also OKX for funding. Those two are likely so deep in this fake arbitrage to FTX that their losses are easily billions, and with FTX going under, these two exchanges/market-makers are likely already insolvent.

TLDR: Because of the FTX collapse, we are dealing with hundreds of millions in losses for market makers, plus these market makers owe actual crypto in debt/shorts due to hedging/arbitrage. So the hundreds of millions of losses could easily double or triple.","self","https://redd.it/yzsby9"

But the same attack succeeded on BCH. Heres why and how to stop it.","Research",0.95,17,0,0,3,0,"There was a recent attack on CRV that ultimately failed.

1) Attackers took out massive loans for CRV.


2) Attackers sold off the CRV to crash the price, so that those with loans for CRV: either long positions or collateral for backed loans, would get liquidated.


3) Attackers did not have enough CRV to sell, so the price did not go low enough, and then buyers bought up the tokens triggering a short squeeze, eventually the attacker got liquidated and lost all their collateral, which market bought the price of CRV to high prices. Even the CRV lenders/platform lost money since there wasnt enough CRV for sale, to market buy back the tokens.


**The recent attack on CRV did not succeed because the attacker did not have enough CRV to crash the price quickly enough below the liquidation levels for those with margin loans.** Due to this lack of funds by the sellers. The buyers were able to simply buy up all the tokens they sold and then short squeeze the price, causing the attacker themself to get margin called and liquidated.

**Source:** for CRV attack: https://decrypt.co/115596/aave-feeling-the-squeeze-even-after-failed-attempt-by-mango-hacker

 However **the same attack was done successfully on BCH.** This attack was likely done by exchanges who can see their users' margin loans, collateral and liquidation prices. Exchanges also can operate on fractional reserves and can sell more crypto than they actually have. So for them money wasn't an issue.

**Due to this shorting method, all BCH margin long positions and BCH collateral for loans were margin called and wiped out.**

**Example 1:** there was no BCH on FTX when they finally revealed their balance sheet. We also do not know how short they were on BCH with user funds, it could be hundreds of thousands, or millions of BCH short that they “owe” but will never rebuy since they declared bankruptcy. Selling BCH was profitable to them, but they wasted this money on other stuff such as embezzlement. 

**Source:** FTX balance sheet: https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/7ab64a3b-6ce0-47cc-96ac-5e2d2a8c5d6c.png


FTX Trading volume chart: https://cryptowat.ch/charts/FTX:BCH-USD 



**Example 2:** Genesis was borrowing BCH through their company and their EARN product on Gemini, then selling off the BCH likely on FTX and giving the USD as a loan to Grayscale who then purchased GBTC with this money. Selling their borrowed BCH was profitable to them, however they lost their funds on FTX and also spent the profits from this trade on GBTC, which is down over 50% from their purchases resulting in over $450M USD in losses. Instead of rebuying BCH to repay their borrowers, they have chosen to just keep everyone's money until they feel like it and hope their gamble on GBTC profits.

**Source:** https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/z3647z/since_jan_2021_digital_currency_group_has_spent/ 

**Example 3:** is that Binance published liabilities for 452K BCH but had only 112K BCH in their wallet. When confronted by this, they deleted their liabilities and also deleted their pegged tokens to match one of their other cold storage addresses. 

They can lie about their liabilities because they are not audited by anyone. They clearly were caught with unbacked 1:1 pegged tokens , and therefore deleted the pegged tokens, which is an admission of guilt. Also how do they just transfer their supposed “reserves” wallet address to another with 0 transactions? Which wallet was the reserve? What is the other wallet and why was it the supposed reserve before the switch?

**Source:** 

Binance 452K liabilities with 112K BCH cold storage: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/yrhvvt/binance_just_admitted_that_they_owe_611919_bch_to/ 


Binance deletes liabilities and also deletes pegged tokens to match a different cold wallet than before: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/z1kxmr/in_response_to_criticism_regarding_unbacked_bch/

**Example 4:** Coinflex is from the other side of these trades, they actually were an exchange which took massive long positions with their customer funds (non consensual & embezzlement/fractional reserves) and got margin called when all the major exchanges sold BCH short. They were a small exchange which got destroyed by the big ones. **These types of massive leveraged long positions actually provide incentives to short BCH and get these positions margin called.**

**Source:** https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/26/coinflexs-creditors-to-own-65-of-firm-after-reorganization/ 



The only way to stop this attack on BCH is the same way it was prevented on other coins. 

**A) When the attackers/shorters dump to cause margin calls, their sells need to be bought up, and the price needs to rise to get the attackers themselves margin called.**

**B) Of course another option is not to use margin and provide incentives for this type of extreme price manipulation.**

Unfortunately as we saw with BCH the attackers were extremely large institutions with more money and paper BCH than the BCH community could deal with, so their attacks have been successful until now.","self","https://redd.it/z80kwq"

And they had been trying to undermine Bitcoin Cash for years.

There are many signs that BTC had been taken over by bad actors already. When you put them all together, it starts to form a clearer picture. Here are some examples.

There is consistent trolls/harassments/smear campaigns against Bitcoin Cash the last 5 years. Who is funding all these propaganda campaigns?

In 2013, Peter Todd was paid off by a government intelligence agent to create RBF, create a propaganda video, and cripple the BTC code.

Blockstream kicking Gavin, the lead Bitcoin developer, out of Bitcoin development, successfully hijacked control over the Bitcoin github.

Mike Hearn and Gavin wanted to prevent Bitcoin from being hijacked, so they created a fork. That fork didn't survived after they were heavily DDOS. Mike Hearn was heavily character assassinated by what I believe to be orchestrated paid campaigns by Blockstream. And of course, now that Mike Hearn is gone, the character assassination campaigns are directed at Bitcoin Cash main supporters like Roger Ver.

I was involved in some BCH projects and there had been multiple DDOS attacks and other stuff, such as flooding my inbox with few hundred thousand emails per day. I'm sure those activities are not for profit, so why are they doing it?

There are actually plenty more nasty unethical things BTC people had done which is not covered in this comment. Bitcoin Cash is an attempt to rescue what the bad actors had hijacked successfully, mainly the peer to peer cash revolution. Uncensorable peer to peer Bitcoin Cash has huge tangible benefits to humanity. Source: https://slp.1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

Whoever these bad actors lacking moral values and preventing improvements to the well being of fellow humans, I curse them and their family for doing that, may their souls burn in hell for eternity.

It has come to my attention that there is growing interest in some merchants in the island that are willing to accept crypto currencies in their lives, businesses and community.  Today I reach out in search of natives of the island that are actively using BCH or want to use BCH to pay for services and food in the island.  

This is a two year on boarding and education campaign that I want to embark in.  Anyone that ones to help or give suggestions is more than welcome.  If anyone has any experience dealing with the natives of the island please share your experience.  I am a native myself, I speak Spanish and English, at the moment I am  living in the United states.  In approximately two years I am looking to relocate to the island and continue the onboarding campaign.    


At the time, I am phone calling some merchants in the island to get details of their needs and questions. If anyone wants to give me any tips, specially with people who has on boarded Spanish speaking population, let me know of your experience!   


Soon I will be launching an Instagram account and in the future a YT/Odysee channel.  

&#x200B;

I am very new to the crypto space, but after viewing the St Kitts conference, I have a new perspective about the this technology and I wish to be part of this story.  This community seems very organic so I am looking forward to interact with all of you soon!","self","https://redd.it/zh7rxh"

&#x200B;

I made this 3d BCH coin project as a  souvenir and prepering it for a 3d print. Could you please advise what  colors should I use when I will be 3d printing it?

I   also want to make a back side of it with a QR code (black/white) to  use  it as a paper wallet - could you also advise how it should be done   properly - meaning that the QR code would be public address and how to  make a private address for it? Should it be attached to the souvenir as a  paper with private key (to take out the BCH on this souvenir or how to  make it better?

Also the whole printed coin with QR code will be filled in clear epoxy resin. That is the idea.

The idea was born from a BTC coin that you could buy with 1BTC on it. I do not remember the name how it was called.

I would be grateful for any response.","https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ub_bVPAQuZKUzBzqjK4BSBEynsz1C5eVdJkam7xDtl8.jpg","https://redd.it/zzp84t"

It’s the community that makes the coin thrive!

My issue: I got a block that took negative 24 seconds to mine. 

blocktime(772985) - blocktime(772984) = 1247 seconds  
blocktime([772986](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/bch/772986)) - blocktime([772985](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/bch/772985)) =    **-24 seconds**  
blocktime(772987) - blocktime(772986) =   217 seconds

According to data I got from [Blockchair](https://gz.blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks/) the chain was at height 772985 at 2022-12-29 12:31:02 UTC then the next block hit at 2022-12-29 12:30:38 UTC, which was before that first block.

Possible explanations:

1. Blockchair simply got it wrong
2. Someone intentionally mined a bogus block
3. I mining tie caused some confusion","self","https://redd.it/zzyh90"

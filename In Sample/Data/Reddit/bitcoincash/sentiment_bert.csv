traction lately with smartBCH being the golding boy on the block Since the smartBCH Defi network took off I have been sitting on the fence watching how things will play out but after seeing the results from several of my friends and some users here I finally decided to dive in and see what the buzz is all about I have been holding back from getting involved in any smartBCH project because I didnt want to put my money in something that I dont know how it will pan out I was also afraid that I will lose my money since there have been a series of rug pulls in most smartBCH projects I decided to finally get involved after reading some of the Defi communitys success stories and watching the recent live chat with several of the Defi team members of the Tropical finance Dex I am ready to pull the plunge because I believe that the smartBCH has a lot of potentials and its a great project to get involved with now that it is looking healthier I am also glad that I decided to get involved when it was still in the early days because I think that now that it has been around for a while it will be a lot more difficult to get scammed This is because there are so many people who have been in and out of the project from the beginning so they will be able to provide valuable insights on how things are progressing I am hoping that by getting involved now I will be able to gather enough information and evidence to support my investment thesis in the future I look forward to being part of the smartBCH community and I hope that most of the projects will be able to provide the same level of support that the Tropical community has been able to provide its members I am not a big investor I will be starting my smartBCH journey with a modest investment capital of 500 to be shared across several projects I will be making small investments in projects that I think have the highest potential and will provide me with the best returns I will also be contributing to the projects that I feel will be able to provide the best support to their community and will be able to provide value to the ecosystem I believe that the more support a project can provide the more trustworthy it can be which will in turn lead to the success of the projects From the information that I have seen posted here about some of the projects on smartBCH presently and the testimonials from several of my friends I have been able to evaluate the strength and potentials of some of the projects that I believe meet my criteria I have evaluated four of the projects that I believe will be able to provide support and value to the ecosystem I will be investing in these projects to see whether they are as good as I think that they are or will I lose my money I will also be looking at other projects that I know will provide value to the ecosystem because I believe that the more value a project has the more reliable it will be The more reliable a project is the more trustworthy it is because a reliable project is less likely to be compromised or scammed The four projects that I have selected to be part of my 500 budgeted in smartBCH are Law token Daiquiri BPAD and Mist tokens I will be sharing the 500 budgeted in those projects with Daiquiri taking the lion share of 200 Law token taking 150 and BPAD taking 100 and Mist taking the remaining 50 This is how I will be dividing the budget among the four projects I will be starting my smartBCH journey with those four projects that I believe will be able to provide value to the ecosystem I will be making my first investment in the Law token project because I believe that this project has the potential to be one of the best in the smartBCH ecosystem I will also be investing in the Daiquiri and the BPAD project because I have read a lot of success stories and success tips from other users who have been in the smartBCH community for some time now I will also be contributing to the Mist tokens project because I believe that this is a great project that is undervalued and has the potential to provide a lot of value to the smartBCH ecosystem I will be investing in small increments so that I can monitor the progress of each of the projects and will be making more investments if the progress that I am seeing is good enough to warrant it I will also be making investments in other projects that I think will be able to provide value to the ecosystem in the future I hope that this article has been able to provide some insights on how I will be investing in the smartBCH ecosystem and also how I plan to make a profit in the long run I believe that the more value a project can provide to the smartBCH ecosystem the more reliable it will be which will in turn lead to the success of the projects I also hope that this article has been able to provide an idea of the strategies that I will be using in my investments I am not an expert in investment I will be learning as I go along and I welcome every bit of advice and guidance that can be provided to me Bottom line As a small investor I wouldnt want to test the depth of the river with both feet nor would I put all my eggs in one basket with my modest 500 invested in smartBCH across four projects I think its safe to say that I will be able to provide some support to the Defi ecosystem while at the same time providing a buffer for my 500 should any of the projects fail to perform as expected I will also be making some profits in the long run because I believe that the more value a project can provide to the smartBCH ecosystem the higher its price will rise which in turn provides me with more profits I will continue making investments in the smartBCH ecosystem and this is just the beginning I am so happy to be able to complete this article and to make it more appealing to readers with the help of Grammarly I was able to take a step further in my writing skill Thank you for your time and dont forget to leave a

Im the guy running crypto for the homeless We recently just had our 3 year anniversary 42819 start date a couple months ago this post is a little bit late For those of you who dont know crypto for the homeless CFTHL is a nonprofit organization I created with the intention of doing something unique with crypto while at the same time helping the needy I started it completely out of pocket at the start and was able to get the organization of its feet immediately due to the massive support shown from social media mainly reddit I never set out to solve homelessness as I think that is a systemic problem that even governments can not fix but rather to reintroduce a human aspect of charity that I felt was sorely missing from most other projects at least in my opinion We differentiated ourselves by utilizing all of the funds we received thus far on foodgoods for the homeless and also delivering food straight to the homelessneedy In addition to this we have photo documentation of all food hand outs as well as receipts dating back to the very first time we handed out food 3 full years of photos at this point which I believe no other charity has come close to doing While we had very humble beginnings we are proud to have 501c3 status for 2 years now and also recently launched our brand new website check it out We also have had a massive amount of volunteer support people buy and hand out food for us and get reimbursed in crypto Our partners in New Zealand have been doing the most amazing work consistently for us and I could not be prouder here is an album of some of their recent work In terms of donations we have received enough roughly 75000 thus far to last us probably a decade or more of work at our current rate if we ration the spending to maintain our current rate which I view as a massive success and also a guarantee of our longevity Ive learned a ton from running this project thus far and Ive used a lot of it to try and improve the project if possible 1 It is impossible to satisfy 100 of people with ANY project for this one in particular there are those who oppose helping homeless people in general and thus they will inherently hate this project no matter what I do 2 It is impossible to make this project 100 trustless despite what most people who have that criticism say It is ultimately a project based on human work and the best that Iwe can do is provide a massive amount of proof of work which we have that should be used as a basis of our legitimacy At this point having 3 years of photos as well as documenting over 20000 donations in monero should be more than enough proof of our legitimacy in addition to reimbursing 100 of our volunteers who participated properly 3 A lot of people want to steer the project in many different directions ultimately the projects design is a very personal thing when it comes down to it I personally created it with a very specific vision in mind and that may not align with what youor other people feel the best vision is That is perfectly fine and yo are free to create a project to carry out that vision in the same way I have carried out mine Projects like this cost timemoney and the very fact that enough supporters on the internet have funded this project to last us 10 years now at least shows that we have a reason to exist I am beyond grateful for this support and intend to respect the intentions of our donors for the extreme long term Which brings us to future plans We currently have a couple people including myself dedicating quite a lot of time each day working on the websitessocial mediacommunicating with volunteer prospectsetc There are actually a lot of things that occur behind the scenes that are very time consuming and we could use 1 or 2 more people working with us on the team on various things social mediaengagementetc This is one of our top priorities right now so if this is something you can see yourself doing please reach out to me even if the amount of time you can commit is small Also as I have stated earlier we are proud of the fact that all of the funds thus donated to us have been entirely dedicated to the buying and reimbursing of foodgoods for the homeless and I intend to keep it that way One repeated suggestion that I have had was to pay our employees for their time even minimal Because of our pledge to not use the funds for that purpose at the start we had to come up with a different solution which is as follows these are wallets we set up for the sole purpose of optional support to provide our employees again this is just to have the option there we absolutely do not require anything to continue to operate but if you want to support the employees that have been working completely free since the start this is the way to do it That about sums it up for now I hope we metexceeded the expectations of those of you who have followed us from the beginning if not we will try even harder going forward Feel free to post any and all criticismsuggestionssupportanything and we will take it all in,Bullish,0.5447016358375549

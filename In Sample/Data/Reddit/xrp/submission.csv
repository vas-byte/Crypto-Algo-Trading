Songbird claim: 31.6M SGB (31,699,020.49378450722 SGB)

https://bithomp.com/explorer/rwU8rAiE2eyEPz3sikfbHuqCuiAtdXqa2v

https://songbird-explorer.flare.network/address/0xA910f92ACdAf488fa6eF02174fb86208Ad7722ba/transactions

They have it in their own controlled wallet.

Exchanges are not required to support airdrops but it is something not to participate in an airdrop and having the funds in their wallet collected on users' behalf (based on their holding) and keeping it for themselves.

At the current price, it represents 6.2 million USD of SGB.

Yet, the Poloniex Exchange platform has not announced plans to redistribute it to their customers, having collected the funds that rightfully come back to them, and keeping the fruition of it.

You are concerned if you held a position in XRP on Poloniex at:
00:00 GMT on 12th December 2020. 

Please help us claim what is yours by contacting Poloniex at:

https://twitter.com/Poloniex

https://twitter.com/PoloSupport

https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us

Ask them what is rightfully yours!

Let's gather and have Poloniex distribute it, the XRP community should also consider all means possible to achieve this goal.","self","https://redd.it/ru9vdv"

* Trustline Added
* Trustline Removed
* Buy Order Placed and Fulfilled
* Buy Order Placed 
* Buy Order Cancelled

This is a huge issue because these transactions and their associated fees are signed using the Ledger Nano. ANYTIME keys are used to sign a transaction where XRP are being credited or debited to my wallet the Ledger Live Application should show this and make a record of this in the Ledger Live Application.

This is a big deal because this these transactions are used to buy XRP on the XRPL DEX (Decentralized Exchange on the XRPL). The XRPL DEX is one of the few places where Americans can buy and trade XRP. Also the XRPL DEX is the cheapest way to buy XRP, period. There are no exchange fees and a very small fee to set the trustline and to record the transaction in the XRPL which is usually around .0002 XRP. 

Ledger support confirmed this was an issue and they will be referring this out to their XRP team to correct. Let's hope this get fixed soon. Until this is fixed I can't recommend the Ledger products and will be moving my XRP to another cold storage wallet.","self","https://redd.it/rxltmd"

(hello curious...) 

Why do people make the argument that its not possible for XRPs price to rise to $100 or above? XRP is a global currency. I've seen maths done where people calculate that if XRP went to $XXX it would make the market cap $X trillion.. and that it would be IMPOSSIBLE for XRP to go that high in value... 

I'm thinking... yeah, $X trillion... and? The US isn't even participating yet, really. Or at least publicly. Ripple and XRP adoption has seen support from 25 countries and counting, maintaining its relative position in the market, during a lawsuit from a notorious bully that never loses a fight, and is making light of it.

However, it seems that these market cap arguments, only encompass and calculate money that exists within US markets. Not to say that US adoption wouldn't be HUGE, just saying that, with US absence, there are still big players in the global market that are not only utilizing Ripple's network but are forming partnerships with Ripple, at the ground level, at an exponential rate.

What's $X trillion dollars next to a global $40 trillion market? If this court case turns in Ripple's favor, is it that hard to hypothetisize that XRP (being the only token that has legal clarity) would dominate; just in its utility alone?

What is the cheapest, fastest, greenest, and safest way to send money globally? 

As of February 2022, the short answer is: XRP

Ripple has effectively created a system, that can transfer multiple forms of fiat, safely within a $40 trillion dollar global market, and is leading the way in innovating technology on the ever-expanding blockchain network. 

There's about 2 trillion dollars, floating around in the current bear-market crypto verse. Ripple is setting precident for all of crypto in this case between them and the SEC. 

Why is it so far-fetched to believe, that a fully adopted XRP, wouldn't yield exponential growth in its value? Possibly spark a new bull-market cycle, less dependant on BTC?

... 

In a world... controlled by the monsters of capitalism, lies a perilous creature so foul; a scrutinuous debo; an immobile jaba-like parasite that feeds on hopeless light that dare wander unto its sights. It slinks in the shadows; its legs have been rendered useless, after years of postulating in its own filth. It searches to extinguish all forms of freedom and revels in blissful gluttony. It has a thousand eyes that it uses to meticulously scan for, and devour, any poor creature that exists under its shadow. It continues to indulge itself, even after its had its fill. This monster is known to all of the land, as the SEC. 

*thunder cackles...**
*lightning strikes a paraplegic orphange, rendering all of the children deaf, mute, and blind..**

*Gensler grins in delight, 
as he yells at his mother to prepare his dinner** 

XRP, a beautiful butterfly-like creature, protruding a halogenic beam of light... unassumingly floats by the SEC monster. 

It politely waves hello and introduces itself. 

The monster, blatantly ignorant of the inherent beauty this butterfly beholds, fixates all of its thousand eyes maniacally. The bottomless pit, described as the creature's mouth, opens, to reveal a set of shark-like teeth that begin to rotate like the blades of a garbage disposal. 

Salavic bubbles lather at the edges of its mouth in anticipation of this seemingly saviory morsel. 

The possessed monster viciously snatches the token out of the air, into its mouth, and swallows it whole. 

The SEC settles, as it blinks, to push down its meal. XRP gurgles down; down into the monster's stomach. 

Everything goes dark.
Everything is still.

This is where the SEC knew it fucked up. 

There were no take-backsies. 
No double stamps.
No forcefield infinity. 

XRP is a monarch, broh, 
thats about to mo that narch.

wat?

In turmoil, the SEC monster begins to thrash violently. Its stomach turns. It begins to vomit and shit uncontrollably; projecting its vile sickness back unto the floor and walls. Lying in its own excrement, it weakishly attempts to shovel the contents back into its mouth; to fill its once full stomach. 

It can only find itself flailing, wildly; convulsive, like a leech after its been plucked from the belly of a dog. 

Screetching... just like argegrhrhrgrgrhrjrhhjjjhahhhahaaa 

wild shit, broh...

Garlinghouse/ Ripple, unflinchingly hold the line, 
as the SEC monster roars in defiance; swinging its massive tentacles deniably. 

Ripple slips underneath its advance like Tyson in his prime. In one fell swoop, the hook, that seemed to be fore-thrown; shakes history.

Time stands still. 

Gensler, miles away...eating his kid cuisine, in his mother's basement, groans in pain... as he is tethered, metaphysically to the monster's being.

The monster revolts in anguish...
as it doesn't like that at all. 

Ripple pounces onto the monster in a murderous rage.. ripping off the monster's ear and spitting it into the crowd. Ripple asks vehemently, ""what the crowd is cooking?"" The crowd cheers. 

The body snatcher that inhabits Gensler, shrieks. His kid cuisine falls to the floor, adding to the hysteria. 

The SEC monster begins to shrink like the IT clown.

Yeah. 
Still curious... 
After the SEC monster is subdued ...


What would prevent XRP from launching to an ATH of $100 or above? Does anyone think the market cap argument is short-sighted, especially with the popular notion that units of XRP will be burned at some point soon? Does anyone really know, or is this all just speculative hopium? Will our air-drop ever come? Wen moon? Wen $589? Wen rkelly comeback tour?

Please.

What would prevent XRP from launching to an ATH of $100 or above? Does anyone think the market cap argument is short-sighted, especially with the popular notion that units of XRP will be burned at some point soon? Does anyone really know, or is this all just speculative hopium? Will our air-drop ever come? Wen moon? Wen $589? Wen rkelly comeback tour?

Please.

Help to me understand. 
I do not speak English. 
Look at me in my eyeball...

Sincerely, 
Curious.","self","https://redd.it/sju0d2"

Ripple is a business that has the largest stake in the XRP ecosystem. 
At one time many years ago the negative arguments that people seem unwilling to let go of were true. The ledger was centralized around a core of high-end enterprise-grade nodes. It was a design choice of Ripple in creating the decentralized XRPL to start with the most robust open quorum BFT network they could devise from the get-go. Which makes sense because the market they chose for XRPs biggest use case the interbank liquidity markets is the largest most regulated market in the world.

They didn't finance the construction of the ledger with sales of XRP. They financed the creation of the ledger through traditional VC funding rounds. There is a long paper trail that proves this. They don't sell Xrp below market rates just to make a buck. This is an erroneous FUD because of the R3 Ripple deal that went to court. They did sell into the secondary markets but completely stopped when the wash trading controversy happened a few years ago where volumes were spoofed across most exchanges. So selling by volume hurt the market so they stopped.

They built the XRP ledger with plans in place to decentralize  over time and completely release it into the wild when the community had grown enough around its use that a shepherd was no longer needed. This is still in progress but close to completion we are in stage 3 currently. In stage 4 it will be 0 control. There are now several UNLs published by stake holders that have as little as 30-40% overlap with Ripples published UNL. 

The biggest reason why I support XRP and by extension Ripple is because Ripplenet the suite of Ripple software and the permissioned public liquidity network built on top of the XRPL is designed to fix a lot of the problems inherent in our financial system. The interbank liquidity markets are owned +80% by just a handful of US banks. They are private monopolies that completely control the largest markets in the world. When a small or medium-sized financial institution creates interest bearing financial products they're immediately sold into the interbank markets where they go up the food chain to the largest banks. They receive monthly payments on this debt, creating a web of interconnected debt obligations throughout our financial system. The big banks then make leveraged plays with their massive portfolios and it doesn't end well. I.e. Lehman Bros and subprime MBS's. when one central counterparty can no longer make their payments then the system crashes because no one makes payments, liquidity dries up and millions of innocent people lose their homes.  The interdependencies in the US financial system that caused 2008 are still present.

Ripple is one of the few companies in the world with an answer to the counter party risk problem. A public liquidity network designed for banking usage. For small and medium-sized institutions can keep performing assets on their books by accessing liquidity for pennies on the dollar compared to the traditional system. This completely removes interdependencies in the system.  The large banks won't be able to run to the FED and cry poor mouth an too big to fail. The FED will say tough shit go source liquidity in the open market.

XRPs value will be determined by utility, it price will increase with volume expansion and increasing velocity. If it becomes legally usable for the interbank liquidity markets CHIPS, CLS International, CME Clearing, DTC, FICC, ICC, NSCC, and OCC. The volume from just one of these markets would eclipse all of crypto several times over, hundreds of times for a few of them.

These make up the US financial market infrastructures which most of the world is begrudgingly dependent on. They are the most liquid in the world. These systems are private monopolies, companies, and banks that provide critical services to the financial system. The FED operates some of financial liquidity markets for interbank market operations supporting liquid markets and preventing a market-wide collapse from a domino effect of a single too big to fail, failing. Like 2008,  Ripple has support from global financial regulators like the IMF, the FED, and BIS. Because it removes interdependencies inherent in the system. This is also why Ripple is facing so much opposition in the US. It's directly challenging the most powerful organizations in the world. US banks, If it's successful it will end the largest monopolies to ever exist.

XRPL itself is having a renaissance with almost 100 new projects since the beginning of the year and major ledger upgrades for federated sidechains, NFTs XLS 20, novel automated markets without arbitrage, hooks which are on devnet now, VM's, smart contracts, the launch of the utility Fork Flare, CBDC's. Great project that will get better and has the potential to be used widely in commercial finance markets.","self","https://redd.it/suald5"

XRP is perhaps the most misunderstood crypto in the entire industry and one of the most hated. Understandable because majority of early crypto was pioneered by libertarian code is law techno anarchists. Ripple is one of the largest and oldest businesses in Crypto seeking the widest commercial adoption for XRP possible. They have deliberately designed the XRP ledger from the beginning to not only integrate with banking in finance but improve it immeasurably. Against the ethos of most self described crypto evangelists, down with all banks an all that.

One of the biggest drawbacks to XRP is the cloud of FUD that has been growing around it since inception. Proven to even have been paid for at points. Constantly misrepresented to the point where people believe the technology which is intended for decentralized payments isn't decentralized. As if the entire thing wasn't created for this exact purpose. Many negative arguments about Xrpl's design for its decentralized network were somewhat true at the beginning of it's development.

Ripple chose to develop a high fidelity enterprise grade core of validators to build the BFT consensus around it was centralized. Eventually decentralizing it over time with upgrades and new nodes. This makes sense when you know that Ripples chosen use case for XRP is banking networks. Criticism abounds that the UNL is fixed an Ripple chooses who can be added. This is false, multiple UNLs exist from separate stake holders any node can become a validator if it meets hard coded criteria, it is automatic. The bar is really high to become a validator because of the XRPL's synocratic architecture.

XRP nodes do require a large investment in hardware that is expensive. Around $20k+ for a full history node and high speed internet connections. There are no incentives to participate as a node operator on XRPL. This will change as federated side chains begin expanding an offering incentives. The hardware does allow XRP to be the only large scale carbon neutral chain soon to be carbon negative because of it's efficiency. However no incentives seems to have hindered XRPs growth vs competitors while others have been able to expand secondary services/ server connections and network growth with incentives.

The elephant in the room and source for the majority of FUD around XRP is token sales and the SEC lawsuit."" Founders are enriching themselves dumping on the plebs"". This is somewhat true but needs context that nearly 99% of cryptocurrency users lack. In the decade + of XRP sales and emissions if you add Jed, Charities, and all other founders. It's around $2-3 billion over ten plus years. To put this into perspective XRPL has no miners no incentives. Compare to BTC or ETH where value extracted from the network in fees alone are over $+1 billion for a few months. Not including emissions from block incentives that have no legal framework or escrow to prevent the largest holders from dumping. Ripple also chose to sell programmatically as a % global volumes.They stopped selling in secondary markets entirely when the wash trading scandal came out in 18', it was concluded that programmatically selling was negatively impacting XRP markets even at 0.0#% of global volume.

 The sales from the execs are identical to sales from founders of other projects that don't catch any shit for it.  The tokenomics and allocation for founders is horrendously bad compared to contemporaries that have created conditions that make # go up artificially. It should be understood that when the allocation agreements were made BTC was trading for $3 and XRPs entire market cap was $4 million.  They never imagined one founders allocation would be worth Billions one day. 

Perhaps the largest impediment to XRPL'S adoption is the use case Ripple is targeting. They are going against the most powerful organizations in the world and it shows. Anyone with a lick of knowledge about finance knows how corrupted the US financial system is. Arguably why decentralized networks are growing rapidly. Wall Street Apes are familiar with Citadel as the largest central counterparty in the settlement of retail equites and derivatives in the US. We saw how that shook out for Robinhood users when RBH was essentially blackmailed into removing the buy button on meme stocks. 

Citadel is just 1 central counterparty and Ripples plans for XRP threaten the entire power structure of US finance. A functional public liquidity network  would have allowed a company like RBH to access liquidity on demand from the network to satisfy settlement of meme stocks in a neutral way. They couldn't because their partnership with Citadel is critical to have a functional business.

There is mountains of evidence that central counterparties are behind the lawsuit using it as a weapon against Ripple protecting the correspondence banking system from competition. Or at least slowing them down until they can grab market share.

 Simpson and Thatcher and Ethereum Alliance members paid former SEC chairman Clayton and Hinamen millions while in office. Hinamen gave his famous opinion on ETH gave them a free pass for their blatant ICO that they obfuscated who participated in the DAO. It's speculated JPM could potentially own +50% of all ETH in existence. The connections are through Lubin, Consensys and the Brooklyn project that Lubin created to cozy up to SEC officials and Wall Street power brokers before the infamous Hinamen speech, even before the ETH DAO.🤔

Simpson and Thatcher also represents a laundry list of Ripples competitors like Apollo Global which Clayton has direct ties to, the largest international settlements service in the world. Also Alipay the largest digital payments network in Asia as well as many of the correspondence banks. 

Clayton immediately left the SEC and began working for One River Asset management which made substantial purchases $1-2 billion in BTC and ETH prior to Clayton's tenure. They also are now in a partnership with Coinbase offering a institutional crypto platform near identical to Ripples XRP offering with the MG partnership for remittances in the Mexican corridor. Coincidence can only happen so many times before it's apparent there are concerted efforts to stop Ripple and XRP entirely. 

XRP was removed from 300+ exchanges in response to the lawsuit and remains hindered in it's potential growth. So it remains to be seen if XRPL and public liquidity networks could end up like public transportation in the US.","self","https://redd.it/sut30t"

You can read the full executive order [here.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)

I’m going to list out key aspects that stood out to me and appear indirectly relevant to the XRPL and it’s methodologies. Feel free to discuss and also point out things I may have missed.

>	Monetary authorities globally are also exploring, and in some cases introducing, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). 

XRPL is positioned well for CBDCs with the native currency, XRP, being a neutral bridging asset.

>	We must reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system and in technological and economic competitiveness, including through the responsible development of payment innovations and digital assets. The United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system, particularly in setting standards that promote:  democratic values; the rule of law; privacy; the protection of consumers, investors, and businesses; and interoperability with digital platforms, legacy architecture, and international payment systems.

Such as Ripple, the private company, developing RippleNet as a direct and more efficient competitor to SWIFT. Additionally ODL utilizing XRP to further enhance the efficiency of the entire flow of money.
If only the SEC would stop being corrupt…

>	The United States has a strong interest in promoting responsible innovation that expands equitable access to financial services, particularly for those Americans underserved by the traditional banking system, including by making investments and domestic and cross-border funds transfers and payments cheaper, faster, and safer, and by promoting greater and more cost-efficient access to financial products and services.

Again… XRPL… RippleNet… ODL… 

>	Any future dollar payment system should be designed in a way that is consistent with United States priorities (as outlined in section 4(a)(i) of this order) and democratic values, including privacy protections, and that ensures the global financial system has appropriate transparency, connectivity, and platform and architecture interoperability or transferability, as appropriate.

XRPL was built with interoperability at its core while having the first ever DEX. It has pathfinding and many other features that makes it a breeze to transfer various different assets with minimal friction.

>	A United States CBDC that is interoperable with CBDCs issued by other monetary authorities could facilitate faster and lower-cost cross-border payments and potentially boost economic growth, support the continued centrality of the United States within the international financial system, and help to protect the unique role that the dollar plays in global finance.

CBDCs seem to be a hot topic. Ripple has been ahead of the curve when they started pushing for them well on the XRPL over a year or two ago.

>	Technology-driven financial innovation is frequently cross-border and therefore requires international cooperation among public authorities.  This cooperation is critical to maintaining high regulatory standards and a level playing field. Uneven regulation, supervision, and compliance across jurisdictions creates opportunities for arbitrage and raises risks to financial stability and the protection of consumers, investors, businesses, and markets. 

Such as the SEC’s absurd overreach and corruption? The rest of the world already seems XRP as a currency. The SEC is virtually one of the only governmental entities in the world who says otherwise.


>	Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the President on the connections between distributed ledger technology and short-, medium-, and long-term economic and energy transitions; the potential for these technologies to impede or advance efforts to tackle climate change at home and abroad; and the impacts these technologies have on the environment.  This report shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order.  The report should also address the effect of cryptocurrencies’ consensus mechanisms on energy usage, including research into potential mitigating measures and alternative mechanisms of consensus and the design tradeoffs those may entail.  

XRPL is carbon neutral since it uses a Federated Consensus algorithm and was built with scalability and sustainability in mind.



Again, as per my disclaimer at the top none of this is directly related to the XRPL. However it appears that a lot of the key focuses in this order lines up with the core principals the XRPL was built on and the main problems it solves such as interoperability/bridging different currencies (both physical and digital), energy efficiency, mechanisms to responsibly handle payments, and so on so forth.","self","https://redd.it/tabum7"

If anybody can educate me one thing that plays heavy on my mind, if xrp is government controlled, essentially publicity stunts like Mr musk etc can have uplifting or negative effects, no mining, and no where near as prising as bitcoin dispite comparison due to both legal/illegal tender which we all know the black market played a huge contribution to the rise. 

Maybe I'm way off the mark but I worry the government led crypto could be q ploy for substantial investments with a projected crash. As said I'm just a little Conservative with covid, the war of Ukraine etc it all seems too aligned 

I would love to hear other people's views and long time investors share experiences

There are two types of payment-compatible currencies that we will start handling this time: Bitcoin and XRP. This is the first time in Japan that XRP is supported on a cross-border EC site. (Our research) Our EC site provides information on used automobiles to emerging countries around the world such as Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia, which are major export destinations, African countries, Ireland, Cayman Islands, Bahamas, and Caribbean countries. We are exporting about 5,000 units a year.

　
    According to a 2017 World Bank survey, 1.7 billion adults worldwide do not have bank accounts, most of them concentrated in emerging countries such as the African continent. According to a survey by Singapore-based exchange Kucoin, the number of transactions of virtual currencies including Bitcoin has increased about 15 times and the number of users has increased 25 times in Africa in the year until January 2022. increase. Since cryptocurrency remittance uses a blockchain (distributed ledger), even if the bank function stops, if the Internet is operating, it can continue to be used without being affected by the bankruptcy of exchanges etc. It has been evaluated and is spreading as an alternative to traditional remittance methods. We plan to continue to increase the number of currencies that can be settled in anticipation of expanding demand for remittances with crypto assets.

　The Company will settle crypto assets through SBI VC Trade Co., Ltd., a crypto asset exchange company of the SBI Group, which will promote money laundering and terrorist financing measures based on international standards. We are conducting appropriate examinations and monitoring of our business partners and other related parties.

　In addition to supporting cryptocurrency settlement of ""SBI Motor Japan"", we will continue to develop detailed services that meet the needs of our customers.""

I work in finance and research, I work between London and Dublin and see many different markets and meet many different stakeholders, some very interested in crypto. I became interested in crypto myself around 2015, I hold a decent amount of BTC, ETH, ETN, XRP and ADA. I just want to throw out some very simple points I’ve learned over the years from talking to many people in the industry, I’ll keep the ridiculous finance sector jargon out of it! Really, to keep this short and sweet I’ll just say the below:
1. Trillions, and I mean trillions, of dollars are just waiting to be invested, in anything. People are frothing at the mouth to get into crypto but funds/legal depts etc will not allow/risk it
2. Once regulated, money always follows
3. Regulation of energy/carbon offset will allow crypto to thrive
4. Despite how it can seem governments want these rules in place and don’t want to fall behind on something that could make up a significant chunk of the economy
5. People do take notice and know more about crypto than I ever expected, they want to be involved 
6. There will be gov CBDCs but they will hold on this for as long as they can for various reasons, primarily regulation difficulties","self","https://redd.it/urijhk"

Since 2020, XRP has been my biggest holding by far, and I've put more than a bit into it. After the SEC case was flopped onto our heads, it only made me want to buy more, more, more because of the artificial price suppression. I want to make money. I mean, that's probably why the vast majority of us are here.

I'm not entirely stupid (just moderately). I know that healthy portfolios are diversified. Having all my eggs in one basket is rough when the rest of the market is performing and XRP seeming to be moving slower, but... dang. I've run charts on so. Many. Other. Tokens. And none of them have nearly as much potential as XRP once it's free and clear of all this lawsuit malarkey. I look at all other tokens and think to myself ""do I think this will hit a 2700% return before XRP will hit $10"" and the answer is almost irrevocably ""no"". Call it hopium, call it investment blindness, or call it being 100% sold on the fact that the whole lawsuit is a stage being set to get the little guy out so the big fish can take over the pool. Whatever you want to call it, I think we'll see a $10 XRP in a few years' time. 

To make the equivalent amount of return, we'd have to see Bitcoin hit $576'000. I don't doubt we'll see that, but before XRP can hit $10? I doubt that. Ethereum would have to hit $51'000, surpassing BTC's price by almost double current price, which would be just absolutely unbelievable to me. 

So my question is... what are you all diversifying with? What projects should I be looking at? I'm fine with a ""risky"" coin that isn't quite memecoin-level imbecility, but short of a brand new project, nothing else in the market has the same level of price suppression as XRP, nothing else has the same white-collar, industry professionals working on it.

Right now I tinker with CSPR, and that's about it, but what else can you all present as an alternative for opportunity during the Great XRP Depression of 2020 - 2023?","self","https://redd.it/wmtum2"

This is where my mind starts planning ahead of time because proper preparation prevents poor performance, and you want to be prepared, not surprised. When the switch gets flipped, millionaires and Billionaires will be made overnight. Do you think here in the Good Ole USA, the government would try to pull something slick and confiscate citizens' XRP? 

For the ones who think the government can't confiscate. Think again; there's an old saying, “ if you want to predict the future, you must learn from the past.” in the 1930's  
Executive Order 6102 was signed off. Now I understand that we’re far advanced in technology, and having a hard wallet is critical. Not your keys, not your crypto is a fact! 

If you can find the time, I would like everyone to have a mature open mind discussion about the possibility of an event like this. Thanks, everyone!","self","https://redd.it/wok16j"

They're basically screwed with regards to their case against Ripple IMO. BUT, even if the Ripple executives win this case, the judge can still come to the determination that current day XRP is a security.   


So, what would give you guys a lot more confidence that both Ripple will win this case AND XRP will not be deemed a security? What would make you a lot more confident in pilling in a lot more money into this?

I would thing if LBRY wins their case, that would set a huge precedent. I admit I don't follow the LBRY case closely though. 

Anything else?","self","https://redd.it/woszyf"

I don't know if some of you knew it already but for the ones of you who didn't know about it's existence and find it interesting, here you go;

https://rich-list.info/

I use it once in a while to see how my position has changed. And ofcourse to snorte a few lines of hopium while checking on how rich I am.

There are over 4.3 million XRP wallets.
You need around 2500 XRP to be in the worlds top 10%.
You need about 10k XRP to be in the worlds top 5%

And with an astonishing 60k you will belong to the top 1% and probably fall under the category we all strive to be under; ""whale"".

Do you think that with 4.3 million wallets, and with 2500 XRP to be in the top 10%, which is at the moment around 1250 euro's worth, is a good thing?

It means we are still early which is good but you can also draw the conclusion that it's far away from being adopted if so many wallets hold so little amounts.

Just food for thought.

There is enough of that going around and I am sure we could all use a break from the ""apocalyptic"" rhetoric. I am extremely invested in XRP and will remain so, regardless of what I am about to say/ask. I am simply writing this post to let my inner Alex Jones out and see what you all have to say.

Warning: I am talking completely out my ass, hence the reason the below is a conspiracy theory.

Here's the conspiracy theory: the U.S. Gov will not let Ripple win because a pro-Ripple win could result in the creation of a multiplicity of US-based crypto-billionaires, millionaires, and close-to-millionaires. If someone invested $20,000 a year in XRP x 5 year period since 2017 = $100,000. If we assume the average price point for $100,000 over a 5 year period is $0.35, then for that person to become a millionaire XRP would have to hit its ATH again at +/- $3.50, which is absolutely possible if Ripple wins.

Of course, the above assumes that investoing $100,000 over a 5 year period is practical for many Americans. According to this [article](https://www.marketwatch.com/picks/heres-exactly-how-much-americans-have-in-savings-at-every-age-and-yikes-heres-what-they-should-have-01659384531), 56% of Americans could not even cover a $1,000 bill with their savings. However, the article specifies ""savings"". Perhaps a majority of that 56% puts any extra income into investment portfolios.

Sure, crypto-billionaries/millionaires were created when Shiba Inu and Dogecoin took off. However, lets be honest, the average crypto user prior to their surges probably thought exactly what I was thinking: they're meme coins, with no utility, they have a max supply of over a trillion coins (in the case of Shiba), these are going nowhere. The average crypto user did not foresee Dogecoin and Shiba taking off, hence why you saw a huge increase in buys after the two hit their ATHs. But then you have XRP, which has the opposite features of the previously mentioned, in which hundreds of thousands (perhaps millions) of Americans see and are thus prepping for when the price surges after a Ripple victory. 

Just like AMC and GME stock buying was illegaly halted to prevent further the price from skyrocketing because everybody and their mothers were invested in those two stocks, in the conspiratorial side of my brain, the same could happen to XRP.

Thoughts and prayers?

Anyway, like many of you I was bummed to see Hogan's final video a couple weeks ago. Whether he was delivering good or bad news, his videos always gave me a sense of sanity. By the start of 2022 when it came to xrp I didn't even bother keeping up with any other news outlets, just waited for the next Hogan drop.

Given that it was his ""final"" one, I thought it'd be nice to have a summary of it posted here to look back on as well as for any new xrp holders who might not know about his channel, so here goes.

Link to video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok1\_xVnRyPE&t=584s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok1_xVnRyPE&t=584s)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

Both parties have filed final replies of the motions for summary judgement. The case is officially in front of Judge Torres (technically she could render an opinion at any time)

Attorney James Filon believes a final decision will be made on or before March 31, 2023

&#x200B;

**The SEC's final brief**

(Hogan notes this brief was better than the initial two)

Summary paragraph:

*“Undisputed facts show that investors paid money for XRP and Ripple stated it would use those funds to promote and try to find use and value for XRP. Ripple also told investors that if it was successful, demand for XRP would increase permitting Ripple investors to profit. XRP investors including institutional ones paid over 2B dollars for XRP because they reasonably expected Ripple and its principal decision makers who had a “giant pile” of or who were “very long” XRP to honor the promises they had made and to do what they were financially compelled to do: use XRP sales proceeds to fund extensive effort to increase XRP’s value.”*

SEC brought up past cases they had prosecuted successfully as persuasive authority, including:

1. Telegram
2. Library
3. Kick Interactive (the most problematic since it was decided in the same court as Judge Torres is in)

&#x200B;

**Ripple’s final brief**

Main arguments:

1. SEC hasn't proven that all alleged sales of XRP involved money
2. XRP was not sold as an investment contract
3. There was no common enterprise
4. XRP purchasers did not rely on Ripple to increase XRP's price

Summary paragraph

*“In short, the SEC is asking the court to rewrite the statutes that define its authority. For the SEC to prevail in its opposition the court would have to endorse the SEC's theory that there can be a investment contract without any contract, without any investor rights, and without any issue or obligations. It would have to endorse the SEC's theory that there can be a “common enterprise” even if the SEC cannot say what the enterprise is or prove any of the elements that define such enterprises. And it would have to endorse the SEC's theory that purchasers could reasonably have expected profits from Ripple's efforts even though Ripple never promised to make any efforts, even though it expressly disavowed any obligation to do so, and even though profits were overwhelmingly due not to Ripple's efforts but to Market forces. The court would also have to conclude that all amici that have expressly said they did not join a common enterprise or expect profits from Ripple's efforts are wrong about their own beliefs and actions.”*

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**Four possible outcomes to the Ripple litigation:**

**1: RIPPLE WINS AT SUMMARY JUDGEMENT**

Hogan and other lawyers believe this is the most likely outcome due to the expectations of profits prong and common Enterprise problem.

The law requires a common Enterprise between the seller and the buyer of an asset and in the state of New York the Revit case is binding Authority. It defines a common Enterprise as one in which all of the investor’s assets are pooled together and the investors all share the risk of profits and losses from the scheme.

SEC has no real answer to this and only spent \~5 pages out of 55 in its latest brief addressing it. From page 7:

*“Investors reaped their profits in the form of the increased value of the token that all investors held and Ripple established a common Enterprise by pooling the funds and using them for its operations including the construction of the digital ecosystem it promoted. This ecosystem was crucial.”*

The SEC has two big problems with that argument:

1. The XRP Ledger had been in existence long before the sales were made so none of the sales money was actually used to build the Ledger
2. The appreciation or depreciation in the token value was based on general market forces and not related to Ripple’s efforts (required by the Revit case)

&#x200B;

Some additional pro Ripple notes:

1. SEC has not provided any evidence that Ripple ever made any legally binding investment contracts to XRP holders
2. Attorney John Denton submitted hundreds of affidavits from actual XRP holders many of which had never even heard of Ripple when they bought XRP
3. The SEC abandoned its expert witness on the issue as to whether Ripple's efforts had any effect on the price of XRP
4. Ripple’s expert witness analysis established that generally (and especially since 2018) the price of XRP moves based on the crypto market rather than on business decisions by Ripple

&#x200B;

SEC’s best evidence that Ripple communicated to investors = Chris Larson’s 2014 interview statement about utility and liquidity growing the network the value of XRP

SEC must meet burden of proof that anyone reasonably relied on that one interview to make a decision to purchase XRP. Given how obscure the interview was, Hogan doubts the SEC will be able to present reasonable evidence of this.

&#x200B;

Two more major pro Ripple notes:

1. Paradigm’s (investment company) Amicus Brief - law firm reviewed 266 legal decisions related to Securities violations.

*“A comprehensive analysis of federal and appellate law reveals that no Authority exists to support the SEC's attempt to transmute the Howie analysis of an investment contract transaction into a conclusion about the underlying asset. In every application of Howie where an investment contract was found there was some identifiable lead legal relationship between an ostensible issuer and the investor providing investment capital.”*

2. One of the cases that the SEC relied on in its reply brief was Davis v Rio Rancho Estates and in that case the court actually held that:

*“There was no management contract between plaintiff and defendants nor were defendants obligated by the purchase agreement to perform any such services and in the absence of a common Enterprise between the parties the expectation of a profit on resale is insufficient to transform what is essentially a sale of real property into the sale of an investment contract.”*

&#x200B;

Hogan has spoken to other lawyers who believe that Ripple may win on this issue on an appeal not at the trial court level but at an appellate court due to the scope of the ruling.

Based on Judge Torres other rulings, Hogan speculates she is the type of Judge that would take the initiative to just go ahead and rule on something as big as this (more on this later\*).

&#x200B;

**2: RIPPLE LOSES AT SUMMARY JUDGEMENT**

A loss could happen for several reasons:

1. Judge Torres decides that the fundamental statutory analysis of whether investment contracts require post-sale obligations is too novel an issue for her to decide and would prefer it went to an appellate court.

Sometimes it’s easier for a judge to rule against you knowing that you will then appeal and then let the appellate Court tackle the issue and then the judge at the trial level doesn't have to deal with it.\*

2. Judge Torres evaluates the four prongs of the Howie test and agrees with the SEC that there existed a common Enterprise because Ripple simply used the money from the sales of XRP to fund its business.

Particularly from 2013 to 2018 there really wasn't much consumptive use for XRP that we have evidence of and it must have been bought therefore for speculative use.

3. Ripple loses on the reasonable expectation of profit prong. The one thing the SEC did a good job of in its earlier briefs is laying out all of the statements, emails, and YouTube videos of various Ripple employees talking about the price of XRP (8 years worth of content). From their brief:

*“The question is whether Ripple lead potential investors to reasonably expect profits from its efforts. That is an objective question answered by economic reality and Ripple's representations not by individual motivations.”*

**Is a loss necessarily bad?**

A loss would only really be bad if it put Ripple out of business, which would occur if the resulting fines were high enough.

Brad Garlinghouse recently said that Ripple has a billion dollars and a ton of XRP in escrow.

The SEC’s initial complaint shows that Ripple was alleged to have sold illegally from 2013 through the third quarter of 2020 1.388 billion dollars worth of XRP. So the worst possible fine amount would equal that plus fines.

Even if Ripple were to be charged the full amount, it could theoretically survive given how much liquidity it has on hand.

**Sales Split**

The judge could also decide that only early sales of XRP were sales of Securities but at some point the sales lost that designation and became non-security sales.

I.e. if only sales of XRP up through 2018 when the on-demand liquidity use case came into being were illegal sales, the amount of sales reduces by almost half.

Hogan highly doubts that a split of sales ruling would happen due to how incredibly complex the framework would need to be. Certain sales of Ripple were made to institutional, others in open market, others were sequestered from Ripple's general funds and separate accounts, some were made to U.S citizens, many were made to International citizens and those sales don't count under U.S federal law.

&#x200B;

**3: SURPRISE RULING THAT RESULTS IN JURY TRIAL**

The Fair Notice defense and Hinman emails

The Hinman emails make an appearance in Ripple’s brief on page 23 but are only used to back up a very specific point, Ripple’s Fair Notice defense.

Ripple took a big gamble by arguing in its initial brief that it isn’t proper for the judge to rule on the Fair Notice defense and that a jury should decide it at trial, then completely stopped arguing about it.

This is dangerous because the SEC has continued talking about it and in their last brief argued that the judge, not a jury, should decide the Fair Notice issue meaning it should be ended here.

The SEC argues the Fair Notice shouldn’t go to trial because it allows the defense to greatly lengthen the trial by permitting defendants to proffer evidence about the SEC's internal deliberations and the beliefs of countless Market participants which would all require rebuttal from the SEC.

In addition, because Ripple would be able to offer evidence about what we the SEC actually did or didn't do we'd have to defend ourselves which isn’t appropriate.

\*Similar to the appellate court appeal, Judge Torres could prefer not to deal with this case and by sending it to jury remove herself from making a decision.

A jury trial would not happen until at the earliest the summer of 2023 and possibly even later.

&#x200B;

**4: UNEXPECTED DECISION (i.e. grants Ripple’s Fair Notice defense)**

Hogan mentions that  unpredictable things can happen in court on occasion. He mentioned granting the Fair Notice defense as an example, but left this pretty wide open in terms of possibilities.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And that about wraps it up. Ideally, I'd hope to see one last Hogan video of him and his wife celebrating a Ripple win and xrp reaching a million dollars per coin. Or, less ideally, if this stupid shit goes to jury trial and there's another decade of kangaroo court maybe the silver lining is we'll get to see Hogan videos again covering those updates.

Honestly, I've been feeling kind of optimistic as of late. I could see the trial ending by 2169, give or take a few hundred years. Seriously though, XRP WILL PREVAIL. God wouldn't have made Hogan if that wasn't the case. See you all on Uranus 😎

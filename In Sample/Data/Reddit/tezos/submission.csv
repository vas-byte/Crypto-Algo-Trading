I’m trying to upload a tezos key to GCP HSM and need some help. I’ve been able to successfully create a pem file in DER format.

&#x200B;

I generate t3z key via pytezos 

\>>> from pytezos.crypto import Key

\>>> newsk = Key.generate(curve=b'p2', export=False)

\>>> newsk.secret\_key()

pub: tz3iSX9B5qVLCRhc2xEmyUM61FrYd1jfZwss 

priv: p2sk2yKCu7fJ1BZnnWq2c6JcoXMzgSVY4ZavDaDgMDPDG8yms2AWD2

Convert to hex

base58.b58decode\_check('p2sk2yKCu7fJ1BZnnWq2c6JcoXMzgSVY4ZavDaDgMDPDG8yms2AWD2').hex()'1051eebd52eeb979bea85f0744bc282862f0461c2e9d2d6198eedb23fdbbd0639a17bab5'

That gives me a hex encoded file of 303502010104241051eebd52eeb979bea85f0744bc282862f0461c2e9d2d6198eedb23fdbbd0639a17bab5a00A06082A8648CE3D030107

I turn it into a b64 encoded file – base64.b64encode(base64.b16decode('303502010104241051eebd52eeb979bea85f0744bc282862f0461c2e9d2d6198eedb23fdbbd0639a17bab5a00A06082A8648CE3D030107', casefold=True)) b'MDUCAQEEJBBR7r1S7rl5vqhfB0S8KChi8EYcLp0tYZju2yP9u9Bjmhe6taAKBggqhkjOPQMBBw=='

&#x200B;

Wrap begin and end tags around it, save it as keyshortform.pem 

\-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY----- MDUCAQEEJBBR7r1S7rl5vqhfB0S8KChi8EYcLp0tYZju2yP9u9Bjmhe6taAKBggq hkjOPQMBBw== 

\-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

Now check that it’s a valid key via asn1parse 

$ openssl asn1parse -in keyshortform.pem 0:d=0  hl=2 l=  53 cons: SEQUENCE 2:d=1  hl=2 l=   1 prim: INTEGER           :01 5:d=1  hl=2 l=  36 prim: OCTET STRING      \[HEX DUMP\]:1051EEBD52EEB979BEA85F0744BC282862F0461C2E9D2D6198EEDB23FDBBD0639A17BAB5 43:d=1  hl=2 l=  10 cons: cont \[ 0 \] 45:d=2  hl=2 l=   8 prim: OBJECT            :prime256v1 It’s o.k and the correct EC curve is shown. Also validate the hex in online as1n decoder - [https://lapo.it/asn1js/#MDUCAQEEJBBR7r1S7rl5vqhfB0S8KChi8EYcLp0tYZju2yP9u9Bjmhe6taAKBggqhkjOPQMBBw](https://lapo.it/asn1js/#MDUCAQEEJBBR7r1S7rl5vqhfB0S8KChi8EYcLp0tYZju2yP9u9Bjmhe6taAKBggqhkjOPQMBBw) works ok

So now follow GCP instructions Firstly they say to convert from PEM file to DER (though it already has a DER format) openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -inform PEM -outform DER -in keyshortform.pem -out pkcsformat.pem

Both auto wrap and manually wrap and upload both automatically and manually. gcloud kms keys versions import \\ --import-job newkeyimport  --keyring Tezos\_Signer  --key Testtezos --algorithm ec-sign-p256-sha256 --target-key-file \~/pkcsformat.pem —location global I get this error – “The key material in the import request couldn't be unwrapped or wasn't formatted correctly”

&#x200B;

What am I doing wrong? There doesn't appear to be much in the way of debug/error messages in GCP. I've omitted a pub-key from the .pem file, could this be the reason?","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/umYgig3fusz7BlOdo51-pg9eS2Vz1MX0wrL__wlYlNU.jpg","https://redd.it/rt8vvr"

I always loved this sub for level headed discussion so maybe you can change my mind.

On Reddit, its easy to be caught up in your own bubble. I really had to **TRY** and improve the quality of my information input (hint: Reddit aint quality). If you are serious about crypto, your best resources are Twitter and legitimate (often paid) research portals. Step outside this sub, and even the most die-hard crypto industry folks will ask you ""Whats Tezos?""

&#x200B;

* Speed of innovation. I have seen notable projects take 2+ years to come to fruition, looking at you Emergents. Being brutally honest, Tezos is cargo cult crypto. It has the right assortment of ""crypto projects"" DEX, NFT, DeFi, etc, but a leader in none.
* Speed of growth. Sure, contract calls are up and to the right this year. So is every other L1, except their growth is 1000x higher than Tezos.
* TPS. Tezos didn't structure its L1 for high TPS as in Solana, and they aren't a leader in L2 research.
* DeFi ecosystem. Plenty was hopeful, but crashed and burned. I don't see notable innovation or ecosystem growth. Tezos TVL is non existent, or a rounding error of other chains.
* Choice of contract language. EVM is a defacto standard. Call EVM shitty, but great improvements will flow onto it just as they have with javascript. Crypto is tremendously adversarial and EVM/Rust will grow to be hardened juggernauts.
* Leadership. Good projects have individuals backing them. Arthur is not a leader. Arthur wants to be an individual contributor and defer hard decisions and leadership work to the foundation.
* The one hopeful avenue within Tezos: NFTs. They managed to capture some usage here, but the value proposition is weak. Plenty of other chains can claim ""green NFT"", ie Solana. However, HEN is a cluster. You might say ""it makes you hopeful about decentralization"" to see how the project has been picked up, but no creator in their right mind views a developer rage-quitting with confidence.
* Forgot one last major bullish point. TF has a ridiculous war chest of BTC and ETH. With not-crappy management, they might be able to produce real value. 

&#x200B;

Will Tezos die? No. If I can give TF one thing, is they laid a solid foundation in terms of dev resources, tooling, etc. The Ubisoft announcement is nice. I think the best thing Tezos can hope for is to be the obscure French blockchain. I dont know about you, i'm looking for more.

Too many common people in gaming still think Ethereum and the worst thing is honestly the price NFTs go for on Eth.

Currently 99.53% of the vote is against. This will change as the participation rate is still quite low, but to reach the supermajority of 80% at the time of writing, there would have to be at least 28 465 votes (rolls) cast in favour of Ithaca. Here are the stats of the previous proposals:

Proposal --> Votes in favour --> Participation rate

Hangzhou: 20 402, 60.42%

Granada: 27 349, 68.27%

Florence: 23 861, 62.15%

Edo: 29 357, 68.76%

Delphi: 30 220, 62.63%

Carthage: 31 573, 74.75%

Babylon: 37 144, 81.88%

Athens: 26 841, 86.99%

Basically, you'd have to go as far back as Edo to find a proposal with more votes cast in favour of it than the absolute minimum that is already required right now, after less than one day of voting, for Ithaca to reach the supermajority. In other words, it is likely that, unless certain actors such as an exchange or the Tezos Foundation decide to actually vote in favour (rather than pass), Ithaca will fail.

For me this is an incredible display of the powerful decentralisation of the Tezos network, and I legitimately could not be more bullish that this is happening. There is consensus that the core of the proposal, consisting mainly of the implementation of the Tenderbake consensus algorithm, is beneficial to the network. The controversy centers around the inclusion of an extension of liquidity baking in the Ithaca proposal, in a take it or leave it manner, i.e. either bakers accept both Tenderbake and liquidity baking, or they accept neither. You can read more about the liquidity baking controversy [here](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/ithaca-ipanema-amendment-injected-why-lb-is-great-and-its-tzbtc-thats-the-problem/4086), [here](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/announcing-tezos-9th-protocol-upgrade-proposal-ithaca/4047), [here](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/usdtz-for-liquidity-baking/3524), [here](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/about-the-post-injection-lb-controversy/3260/35) and [here](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/announcing-granada/3183/4).

My 50 cents are that there were clear misgivings about liquidity baking. It has been an abject failure thus far insofar as the XTZ-tzBTC volume has been abysmal (more info in the first of the four links above). In that context, it is perhaps a bit strange that the proposal was injected without even a hint of discussion about the merits of continuing liquidity baking. I would call the ""concession"" in the Ithaca proposal to lower the escape hatch threshold for cancelling liquidity baking to 33% borderline deceitful, as with the weight of the foundation, exchanges, and the technical steps involved in activating it, it would realistically still never be met.

A counterpoint is that it is not Nomadiclabs' responsibility to inject proposals in the most democratic way possible (i.e. by allowing bakeries to endorse separately the strictly technical upgrade that is Tenderbake and the more controversial one that is liquidity baking), and that, as any other actor in the ecosystem can do as well, they are merely injecting a proposal that they think is beneficial to the Tezos ecosystem and putting it up for a sttaightforward vote. I think this argument has tremendous merit, and the Tezos community / bakers should be strong enough not to have to rely on the enduring deference of centralised actors such as core development teams.

This is precisely what is happening. As a community, I think we should embrace this moment and we should be grateful that we have bakers that are so engaged in the ecosystem that they insist on having their voices heard. Whether it will be because NomadicLabs may finally inject two competing proposals, the Ipanema amendment beats out Ithaca next time around, the supermajority is somehow still met this round, or in some other manner, Tenderbake *is* coming.

1. Tezos foundation is audited by PWC, so it can't pay market makers to manipulate the Tez price upwards or provide liquidity in decentralized finance protocols.
2. Tezos foundation is the only Blockchain foundation that is audited... this should make you ask yourself the right questions:
   1. Unaudited foundations should have a field day manipulating their token price or providing liquidity in DeFi protocols, but this represents a significant risk with financial regulators, and I think in the future many of these foundations will pay for this kind of practice.
   2. Do you really think that companies like Ubisoft, Riot or BNP Paribas will accept to work with technologies that are linked to unaudited Blockchain foundations in the next few years? This means that Blockchain projects with unaudited foundations will have less and less access to these kinds of players, because they won't be willing to give up manipulating their crypto's price.
3. Based on this constant (point 1 and point 2), the only solution for Tezos to build a DeFi ecosystem is indeed to have an on-chain AMM, hence Liquidity Baking. However, I think we need more than just the Tez-TzBTC pair, but we also need the Tez-[uUSD](https://youves.com/) pair and also the [uUSD](https://youves.com/)\-TzBTC pair (if possible) for the following reasons:
   1. [uUSD](https://youves.com/) is the only serious stable coin on Tezos and it is a very MakerDAO inspired project. The team behind it is serious and the project is governed by a DAO (so it is decentralized!), which is much more serious than Kevin Mehrabi's USDTez project which is completely centralized!
   2. We all know that the cornerstone of decentralized finance is a strong stablecoin, we are lucky to have the [uUSD](https://youves.com/) working, why not use the Liquidity Baking principle to bring liquidity to the [uUSD](https://youves.com/) rather than crying waiting for Circle to integrate the USDC on Tezos? 

Tezos' approach is more serious and composed than that of our competitors, but we have everything to succeed, we just need to ask the right questions.","self","https://redd.it/rvxhmy"

Tezos boutique will be voting YAY again now unless tech issues are found during the voting process. We will offer a 0% fee to any delegates of any boycotter that will join our cause.

Tezos Boutique, among the OG bakers, albeit unhappy with how LB is performing, will not be joining the boycott and much less so in the “abstain from voting” way. Below are our reasons:

* Abstaining and failing to meet quorum has a negative impact; a lower quorum allows fewer participants to pass a proposal, increasing the “cartel” scenario possibility. Abstaining is understandably a desperate measure, but consider such action pretty much like holding the quorum safety hostage to please a call for attention. We can surely do a lot better than that as a community.
* There is the possibility to stop it by promoting a movement to reach the % needed to signal-stop LB; our bakery would have joined such an initiative. Our opinion is that this will send a more constructive and solid message out there than this whole boycotting idea.
* The majority decided to try LB and activate it; boycotters did it knowing ALL the rules of that proposal, including the flag to stop it and the quorum required to do it. Boycotters accepted these terms when they voted YAY in the past; just as we did, we carry the consequences, and we process changes honouring the rules we agreed and voted in. We will never hurt the commonwealth on purpose because we noticed late that we didn’t like it.
* The core devs are honouring the above result when they take the active stance to extend it instead of letting it just expire; alas, it is not their call anymore to stop LB without asking us, stakeholders, we put the thing in, we take it out in the same way.
* We believe the time to market for tenderbake is way more important than the outcome of whatever the message intended by boycotters is, and we do not understand how on earth this is not clear for them. So we will vote YAY for Ithaca unless a technical issue is found during the process.

With all the above in mind, our bakery will signal the escape hatch for our independent reasons to dislike the LB experiment. We dearly hope that the majority will know better.

You have the right to vote NAY or PASS if you dislike the proposal, but vote, in the name of decentralization, please, vote!

So, we are offering a 0% fee to all delegates with at least five cycles under a proven boycotter and until we’re out of space (not NAYers, which are playing by the rules, thank you, but from those abstaining\*) until the end of voting and, in case of approval, for the whole duration of this amendment and until the next letter will be injected (10% fee afterwards, 3.5% by joining and sticking with us in our Telegram channel).

Sincerely,

The Tezos Boutique team.

\*EDIT: Not all of those abstaining, obviously, just the ones doing it on purpose to boycott, we would take their unhappy delegators happily.","self","https://redd.it/rwa9sj"

I'm no native english speaker so some things are harder to understand. They are also not to well explained for me, on this way I hope to get some help.

I have a little bit of experience with Ethereum and thought about using and learning about Tezos as well, while fees on Ethereum are exploding.

So here are my questions:

1. Storage fee: In the whitepaper its stated ""Since storage imposes a cost on the network, a minimum fee of ꜩ 1 is assessed for each byte increase in the storage."" (3.3.4 Storage fees - whitepaper)

When do you have to pay deposit fees and how do you calculate them before making any action in the network? Thats for NFts only?

(if I am right someone minted a NFT and he has to pay 0,07225 XTZ. how is this not a byte?

[https://tzstats.com/ooimV64k76X4k28R5yKX4GDov6qKJ8g9dEWPtZC8fYnPb6zSsbm/134689906](https://tzstats.com/ooimV64k76X4k28R5yKX4GDov6qKJ8g9dEWPtZC8fYnPb6zSsbm/134689906))

I also found this site ([https://www.leewayhertz.com/tezos-smart-contracts/](https://www.leewayhertz.com/tezos-smart-contracts/)), but I don't think it's explained storage fee there?

So, is this the answer?: ""where INT is a signed 64-bit integer and string is an array of up to 1024 bytes. The storage capacity is limited to 16 384 bytes, counting the integers as eight bytes and the strings as their length."" (3.3.1 Contract type - whitepaper)

2. ""When a stakeholder observes the seed and realizes he can mint a high priority block in the next  
cycle, he can make a security deposit."" (3.2.5 Mining blocks - whitepaper)

Someone can explain this to me? Does It mean you can get priority to bake certain blocks you have chosen, If you send some XTZ and you also get them back after baking?

I am researching more, while I hope to get some help from you guys.","self","https://redd.it/rwvtlo"

A lot of bakers are having problems making payments to CTEZ vaults because people aren't allowing baker payments to go through.  

I think this feature added a bit more complication to the CTEZ process than necessary, but it is what it is....  Sorry bakers... I know this sucks.  I also feel sorry for the delegates since there is no alert telling them to whitelist their bakers address.  Hopefully this alert feature is added in the future.  
 If you have opened a vault you need to->

1) go to the vaults settings page and edit depositors

2) Add your bakers PAYMENT address to the whitelist, or press ""everyone"" if you don't know it.  Kryptstars payment address is:

People DO NOT want to pay even more than what they're paying now, for something that gives little in terms of game experience.

So, my first and very vague idea for NFT adoption is to make a unique online trophy system for games. With these trophies you would have hyper exclusive game changing events happen IN the game.. Via random encounter.. Display attributes etc.. (small example - a trophy that makes yoy appear drunk when you own it.. These trophies can then be traded for OTHER unique experiences that game devs will have to implement as they see fit. This would allow not only a massive unique cross game experience or single game use scenario.. Where only the owners of the NFTs can benefit from the unique characteristics of that trophy.. Maybe there's only 10'000 ""drunk trophies"".. Maybe there's a trophy that allows you to have red eyes.. Maybe there's a trophy that allows you to whistle a certain tune in game.. Allowing others to hear it and take interest.. These ideas are just the tip of the iceberg and I encourage everyone reading this to start throwing out ideas to get NFTs placed in games, properly.

The reason IMO is the lack of investments (and the tooling to develop on tezos but that's another story)

Let's look at the numbers: the metric is GRANTS + ICOs

**ICOs:** In total, projects have raised about 5-10m$ from the community:

* Smartlink 2.5m$
* Crunch \~1m$
* Rocket \~1m$
* Spicyswap \~0.5m$
* Sexp \~0.5m$
* Tail of rocket or instaraise launch (easy, pixel, goeureka, tezid in the 200k$ region)
* Other investments we dont know about, DGH deal with Plenty etc

**GRANTS:**

If we look at the bi annual report ([https://tezos.foundation/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tezos-foundation-biannual-update-september-2021-en.pdf](https://tezos.foundation/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tezos-foundation-biannual-update-september-2021-en.pdf))  
If we sum the DeFi projects, and assuming all of them receive the max amount per month, we reach **6.6m$ of grants** for the period January-June (4% of Tezos grants… while 50%+ ie 75m$+ for OneOf, McLaren, Redbull, TQTezos)

So it looks obvious that TF has trouble investing in DeFi projects (regulatory reasons etc)

If we assume the same money was spent for the last 6 months from TF on DeFi projects, we get 13.2m.  
**And with another max assumption of 10m$ for tezos ICOs, we reach 23.2m$ in total for DeFi tezos projects**

There is an agora thread [https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/an-on-chain-funded-and-governed-dao-by-the-community/3830](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/an-on-chain-funded-and-governed-dao-by-the-community/3830/7)

Where the idea is to use 1% of the baking rewards (40m$ with a 4B% tezos mcap) to fund a community treasury that can invest in DeFi.  
That would mean a 200%+ increase in Tezos DeFi investment, and can hopefully kickstart it seriously!

You can comment on the agora if you are on board with it (or not obviously :))","self","https://redd.it/ry6fgo"

I’m not a huge bag holder, but I do have some XTZ bought and held on Binance.  
Now I’d like to move them to a different wallet, mainly in order to get better staking returns (their APR is honestly infuriating given the protocol’s actual rewards)

I got into crypto not too long ago, and the projects I invested the most all provide an extremely professional and polished official mobile wallet app, and for them I never really had to think twice which wallet I should be downloading. Not to mention staking always proved to be dead simple.

With Tezos I just don’t see the same environment, I’ve been looking for an official wallet but there is none, and I don’t see why I should use some 3rd party multicoin wallet.

Am I just plain blind, and missed the actual official app? Or does Tezos really lack an official wallet? 

This sounds extremely bearish to me, given the money they are spending on Reddit ads I just don’t see why they wouldn’t develop their own app.

We are 30% into the vote and it is still about 50/50.  I am a proponent of liquidity baking but it seems the people have spoken.  I have been reading stuff here and there and it isn't even that everyone is flat out against LB it is that some want to wait for USDC and others object to mixing voting and baking (using the escape hatch via baking).  Apparently it can cause problems. Mack from Kryptstar had a good video about this: [https://youtu.be/r2hrU2KHa0M](https://youtu.be/r2hrU2KHa0M)

I was around for the Ethereum DAO debacle which ultimately caused the split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.  And before that there was the blockspace war in Bitcoin that caused the split between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

Technical issues/decisions can quickly turn into political opinions in the blockchain space.  Usually that does not happen.  But we as a community need to be hyper-vigilant in watching out for signs of such an issue.  When an issue appears where there is even just a vocal minority it is not a good idea to bundle it with uncontroversial stuff like in our current case: Tenderbake.

But also as TheHalfSoul Tweets:

[https://twitter.com/The\_Half\_Soul/status/1479206656391229445?s=20](https://twitter.com/The_Half_Soul/status/1479206656391229445?s=20)

""In a race against Eth 2.0 & countless others, are you are really going to let Liquidity Baking stand in our way, giving Eth 2.0 & all other protocols 3 months on [\#Tezos](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tezos?src=hashtag_click)📷? Or are you going to push [\#Tezos](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tezos?src=hashtag_click)📷 forwards, Now, Today. Make the choice live by it. The Governance remains. [$XTZ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XTZ&src=cashtag_click)""

I agree.  3 months in crypto is like 3 years in normal time.  We will fall behind if we do not get Tenderbake through.  We need some outside the box thinking

I think as a community that we need to admit that we made a mistake.  The community should have seen that LB was at least slightly controversial and as such should have been clamoring during the proposal period for there to be an identical amendment minus LB.  That is our fault as a community and we need to own it and never let it happen again.

I was just talking to David\_99 in the Tezos discord chat and he told me that once you vote you can still vote the opposite way and nullify your vote but -- and this is the crucial point -- it will still count towards the quorum.

I think we need to organize something.  I don't know how.  But we need to convince the big bakers to reverse their vote and bring it to 0.  I think maybe we should agree that as a community we will 100% have a competing amendment minus LB during the proposal period of the next upgrade, and let's humbly ask the anti-voters to reverse course and suck up LB for one more time so that we do not hold back development.

I think the anti-LB people (and anti for diverse reasons) have made their point.  I think their stand will also make governance stronger and more efficient in the future because I think folks will be on the lookout for controversial stuff and make sure it has its representation during the proposal period because otherwise we fall way behind on our development schedule and will lose network effects to competing chains. (This stuff needs to get solved during the proposal period not the exploration period and I believe that we will do that in the future because losing 3 months of development is too high of a price to pay.)","self","https://redd.it/ryd5g0"

This is a proposed compromise in which we get Ithaca without liquidity baking (LB).

Given the controversy over LB and the ""no"" votes from PosDog, TezosWakeNBake, and others, there's a danger Ithaca won't pass ([follow the vote here](https://agora.tezos.com/period/63)). That would be very disappointing, as Ithaca contains the Tenderbake upgrade which among other things enables fast finality and a path to faster block times.

Ideally, we'd have competing Ithaca proposals, one with LB and one without, and the democratic process could run its course. Unfortunately, we only have the proposal with LB, so there's no way for bakers like PosDog to simultaneously show their support for Tenderbake and their opposition to LB.

Here's the compromise idea: The larger ""yes"" bakers meet with the larger ""no"" bakers. The ""no"" bakers agree to change their ""no"" votes to ""yes"", and the ""yes"" bakers agree to activate the LB escape hatch as soon as Ithaca is activated.

In this scenario, LB is effectively removed from the Ithaca upgrade without requiring a new amendment be injected. Tezos gets Tenderbake and we get another 10 weeks to come to a decision on the future of LB.

I'm probably going to receive a lot of flack for this, but I figured I would state my opinion from a computer this time and hope that people don't misconstrue what I am saying.  I tried to ask the experts to help with the numbers but, I didn't receive a clear answer, so people can respond after reading this.  One of the foundations of my bias against liquidity baking is both that it is a tax, and that the escape hatch, in its current form, seems like a facade.  

Personally, I would love to be persuaded else-wise, but I don't see any metrics on how tzBTC-LB has been used to improve Tezos or the community.  Also, doing the math, I don't like how hard the escape hatch is to activate. 

&#x200B;

In 1894 the first over-seas tax was formed to tax Americans living abroad.  This in itself isn't bad, depending on where you live, however the fact is, the minority have no real voice in this matter.  Expats living overseas get taxed abroad and receive very little benefits from that tax(Embassy services? ha).  There is literally no way for expats living overseas to remove this law because there simply isn't enough of them to vote it out(they don't have a loud enough voice).

In the case of LB on tezos, I feel like the same thing could happen to private bakers if we allow proposals to be made that have both economical(liquidity baking) and protocol level changes(Tenderbake).  Maybe my fear is unfounded, but I ran the numbers and I still feel the same way.  The amount of voting bakers isn't enough to actually activate the escape hatch, even at 33%(check below numbers).

This, according to google and many other sources ""inflation"" is a form of ""tax"".  Delegates pay a ""fee"" to their baker, and the baker is paid with inflationary tax(albeit not crazy inflation).  Do you really think governance happens without some sort of tax?  Its just hidden in another word and made MUCH more efficient(supposedly).

https://preview.redd.it/jz94ds3u62b81.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=f80fb2a4a6eb04cc6ebc4796191869d1cef304ca

With Liquidity baking, a select few who are able to do KYC with the French gate-keeper Whorton(excludes USA citizens) can mint and enjoy the full extent of the benefits.  The expats don't have a voice in how their tax is used.  Is this the same for Tezos?  If we are using this tax to benefit the network, we should have a solid plan to use the $7million in Tez that is created by the inflation(maybe less as the XTZ price is currently decreasing).  

# Escape hatch metrics:

Please bear in mind, I have asked experts to do this but they were to busy to work through the whole process.  So I did the best I could.

&#x200B;

Ithica proposal will change the escape hatch activation threshold to 33% if passed.

Example governance turnout for Hangzhou Exploration period:

https://preview.redd.it/z8braexw62b81.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=51ae48dd744121dbaf7621e6c977ba9f8e27c826

[https://tzkt.io/governance/32/exploration](https://tzkt.io/governance/32/exploration)

24.27% yay

1.77% nay

34.48% pass (mostly exchanges and TF)

so in essence we need participating bakers(yay or nay) to inject the escape hatch on their baker.  In the past Hangzhou exploration period, we only had: yay + nay= 25.94% of all bakers vote.

Arthur did mention the TF and/or Exchanges could inject the escape hatch, but, judging from past experience, that is highly unlikely.  Anyone who chooses not to inject the escape hatch automatically VOTES FOR LIQUIDITY BAKING with this model.  Basically locking it in until it expires(or keeps getting extended with the same logic).

**This means:**

That 33% of all bakers to would need to inject the escape hatch, which is 7.06% more participation than we currently have voting yay or nay.  

**math:**

33%-25.94(voting participation in the past)=7.06%

**In even more basic terms:** 127% of current governance participation(in rolls) is required to activate the escape hatch if **100% of those participating bakers** activates it.  This seems like very ridiculous numbers to me if you compare them to our regular governance voting system.

If we had a yay/nay/pass vote using on-chain governance, it would be much easier to pass(and fair/transparent for those voting agains LB).

Even with a good turnout (for example 35.8% in the Delphi Promotion period) we would need 33%/35.8% = 92.18% of all bakers active in governance to  inject the escape hatch for it to be removed.

So I’m just a small time Tezos holder, I like the Tezos community. I’ve been reading a lot on this liquidity baking lately, and most recently I read the article on tezcommons dot com by William McKenzie.

To me it seems like LB is aimed to help “whales” or large buyers and sellers of tez, which kind of confuses me as how it helps let’s say a small supporter like me? One of the quotes from the article.

“When trading a larger amount, traders have to cross more limit orders at increasingly worse prices.”

So in a non LB scenario if a whale wanted to buy a whole bunch of Tez they would have to buy it at market price which would naturally make the prize of Tez go up because if they wanted 1mil Tezos they’d have to buy up until they get their 1mil Tez but of course the 500,000th Tez would cost more than their 1000th, and the 900,000th tez would cost more than the 500,000th etc.

Now maybe I’m just uninformed in the technicals but it seems like from that article a whale could acquire all their Tez for the same price, let’s say $4.50 for all 1mil tez which wouldn’t move the price up at all. Of course Bakers and people with a lot of Tez benefit from Tez not going up in price because they’re constantly making money, but what about us at the bottom that depend on the price of Tez to go up to make a profit?

Again not for or against anything, just looking for some clarification.","self","https://redd.it/s2gd9s"

Tezos was the second chain to successfully implement its own smart contract languages. It was the second chain that Societe Generale did blockchain experiments with (Ethereum was the first). It was the second chain to successfully build an onchain dex from the ground up. The second chain to build a decentralized stablecoin from the ground up (Ethereum was obviously the first). It was the first chain that built an onchain stablecoin that allowed to you continue staking while providing collateral. It was the first chain to do the same with a dex and other aspects of defi. It was the first chain to implement liquidity baking (a dex built into the protocol itself so as to improve liquidity for the native asset). It arguable has built the most advanced STO ecosystem with many firsts there. And so on...

Now you might be thinking ""Ok first or second first or second -- who cares?""

Well care, speed is almost everything with technology. First to market is very important as it often allows you to gather network effects. A fast follower can sometimes get pretty good network effects too -- which is why second can be important. Just look at say look at litecoin for example. Second crypto ever created.

Well why isn't Tezos doing better with price?

I think: because crypto is also this weird PT Barnum space -- and often saying you are doing or are going to do something is more important than the doing of it. Or at least that was the case for years. It allowed other chains that were say just hoping to one day years in the future to achieve what Tezos has achieved now to get many more followers than Tezos.

Crypto is also a space where copy pasting has done very well lately.

What gives me hope is that Tezos in building everything from the ground up and because it is first or second in so many things has shown time and again that it strives for and achieves excellence. Tezos has a one two punch which is that (a) it innovates (for example in things it is first in) and (b) adopts what other chains are successfully using. (Innovation has to occur there too to be honest)

One example of b is that Tezos has been, for years, tirelessly changing the code of Tendermint to optimize it for Tezos -- calling it Tenderbake. Another example of b -- Tezos spent much time writing in the privacy tech of Zcash into its code base.

In the future it will produce its own rollups and other scaling technology. Tezos is also very decentralized and decentralization is the point of a blockchain -- that is how it achieves its store of value properties.

So the main reason I am hopeful about Tezos is that they have a history of excellence and I see no reason for that stopping in the future. It is easy to get sidelined by other chains promising sugar plums and fairies and if enough people get snookered it actually become a self fulling prophecy -- at least over a small or medium timescale.

The organic growth (and the organic part is key here because many other chains are literally spending hundreds of millions to inorganically say provide liquidity) on Tezos is breathtaking. Month over month exponential growth. Tezos is building a platform filled with users who actually want to use the stuff and who are not here to just try to make a quick buck and then move on to the next chain.

And do you know where that really shows? It shows in a place where you would least expect it. It shows in the quality of the NFT art on Tezos. I challenge you to find any other chain that has better quality NFT art (except maybe Ethereum) you are not going to find it. Because the art on other chains is just copy paste Ethereum stuff. But the artists in the Tezos NFT scene are highly talented. I believe that is because the artists feel the organic energy that flows within Tezos. You find it in everything from the wallets like Kukai (which is the only browser based wallet in crypto were you can send crypto to someone with a gmail or twitter account -- try it it is amazing) to the quirkiness of the NFT exchanges here like Hic Et Nunc. And that is because so much sweat and tears -- and creativity -- goes into EVERYTHING built on Tezos. It is not a copy paste fly by night operation --- it is the total opposite. The legitimacy of Tezos is off the charts. The other reason I think artists love Tezos so much is because of what I was talking about before -- store of value. Due to the highly decentralized nature of Tezos (you can run a node on a raspberry pi for example) you can be more confident that Tezos will be around hundreds of years later -- which is important with art -- where pieces can be passed on within the family for generation after generation -- or traded and building value for hundreds or thousands of years. Artists can achieve a slice of immortality with art. But they cant achieve that if the platform fails them because it is centralized.

Also recently Vitalik Buterin pointed out the he was not hopeful about multichain crosschain stuff. That is the stuff that is very in right now. He did not like the security of it all. Tezos has always been its own island, its own nation, largely avoiding that stuff. He also recently noted that he thought interesting things were happening on Tezos and that it is a decentralized and honorable community. I think he recognizes that it is a chain that is putting in the hard work and doing everything from the ground up -- and building its own organic ecosystem. And I believe that is the best chance any chain has for building true network effects. The price action on Tezos has been very subpar compared to other chains who have achieved so much less and have mostly promised sugar plums and fairies -- but the creativity and landmark accomplishments of the chain has been nothing short of breathtaking. The madness of crowds cannot be predicted but I believe the excellence of Tezos will continue far into the future and that its network effects will continue to build month after month. The artists of the world with their artistic sensibilities have been the first community to truly take note of the legitimacy of Tezos -- I believe other communities will follow.","self","https://redd.it/s30pye"

It is another (Oh no!) PFP project.  It def has a cryptopunk feel.  But here are the main differences I have found (1) the artist or artists (will say artist from now on) is building everything bespoke -- whereas with the Punks much was created via algo (2) it is the face and upper body whereas the Punks are just the face. (3) Some of the pieces have animation whereas the Punks are all static (4) creating everything via hand allows for a greater variety of characters (5) the pieces are not minted they are dropped to the market one by one.

There have been lots of projects that have tried to emulate the Punks.  But I think this one is interesting because the artist is trying to create 10,000 characters by hand.  You can tell the artist is trying to do this because the numbering is down from the top (from 10K down) and up from the bottom (1,2,3...) so both directions at once.  Which is crazy!  So part of me is just curious to see if this artist is going to be able to pull this off.  There is a reason that the Punks used an algo! Even if the artist creates one a day (and painstaking effort looks to be put into many of these) the project would take about thirty years!  If the artist is too old death may occur before completion.  So this is an epic quest.

Another reason that I am interested in this project is that I believe that much of the power behind the Punks is that there are so many of them with such variety that if you look at those 10,000 for long enough you can find one that really represents you or your essence -- and then if you have the deep pockets you can buy it.

Probably every native chain needs a legitimate PFP project like that -- one that represents a vast breath  of people because crypto itself is taken up by many different types of people -- that is the nature of decentralization, anyone can join.  And by creating each of these by hand the artist will be able, I think, to create even more variability -- even more of a slice of life.  There are only about 200 Tezos Thugs created so far but you are already starting to see evidence of this variability cropping up.  For example one of the Thugs has a huge beard, which is something you don't see with the Punks.  So if you are a human with a huge beard you are now better represented with the Thugs than the Punks.  That sort of nuance will continue for...well I guess years into the future -- or until the artist gives up.  But I am going to cheer the artist on (well I suppose I have to now that I have bags -- that's the nature of crypto isn't it: cheer on your bags ;)

I also found that the languages used in XTZ are extremely secure and it’s totally controlled by the users of XTZ and it’s bakers.

TF is supposed to be baking to help the network...**but is voting PASS on every proposal helping the network?**   


Here is an idea.... **put that voting power in the communities hands where it can actually help the network**. Create a program where TF delegates a portion of their rolls to bakers in the community that are checking all the boxes to include actually voting on proposals. This would incentivize new and current bakers to vote as well as potentially bring in more bakers. If needed, it could even utilize TezID to KYC the baker on chain. This isn't anything new either. Harmony, another chain that just jumped above Tezos in marketcap, created a similar program a little over a year ago: [https://medium.com/harmony-one/introducing-the-pangaea-validator-academy-earn-6m-one-delegation-2195bf016177](https://medium.com/harmony-one/introducing-the-pangaea-validator-academy-earn-6m-one-delegation-2195bf016177)  


TLDR: TF is supposed to be baking to assist the network. However, voting pass isn't helping and will make most controversial proposals impossible to pass. Put your voting power in the communities hands and enable bakers by creating a program that delegates XTZ to bakers that are performing all their duties including voting.","self","https://redd.it/s51512"

* 1. Let whoever I delegate my Tezos to vote on my behalf. (Currently the only option)

At the moment we only have option 1.

I think we need an option 2, where we do not have to give our voting rights away.

The delegate/baking system could carry the vote of the original address holder through.

I had to move bakers due to my baker not accepting my vote, then realized that my timing was off by a week because of the time it takes for me to change delegation.

How is this fair from a voting perspective?

In my view the entire Tezos voting system is centralized and broken till we can actually respect the vote of each Tezos.

My understanding is that the Tezos baking/delegate system is built the way it is, (takes time to change baker, etc...) to enable the Tezos network to have stability from a system operations perspective and efficiency perspective.

I am ok with that.

However that is counter to the way a voting system should work, the users voices are rarely reflected with these votes.

The network should have a way each Tezos address over a certain size, say 1,000 Tezos, gets to have their vote (if they want) regardless of the bakers vote.

If there is a slight increase to Tezos network complexity from this change, I would say that is worth it for a fair system.","self","https://redd.it/s5ea1r"

I would suggest moving away from them as a baker.

First Google hit for “Tezos Liquidity Baking Escape Hatch” is this: https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/liquidity_baking.html

The last line of the that page provides the EASIEST method ever conceived to vote for the escape hatch.

>	The escape hatch can be invoked through a JSON file containing a vote that is repeatedly submitted on each baked block, e.g. tezos-baker run with local node ~/.tezos-node alice –votefile “per_block_votes.json” where per_block_votes.json contains just {“liquidity_baking_escape_vote”: true}. See also the baker man page.

To anyone following/believing these people, they don’t have the “technical acumen” to read the directions on how to cast their vote. Do not trust them, or their bakeries.

6.13% \* 0.08 = 0.49%

“This sluggishness has made the network vulnerable in a different way—by encouraging rivals. In early 2021 nearly all of the assets locked in DeFi applications were on Ethereum’s network. But in a recent research note JPMorgan Chase, a bank, estimates that the share of DeFi applications using Ethereum fell to 70% by the end of 2021. A growing number of networks, such as Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Terra and Solana, now use proof of stake to run blockchains that do the same basic job as Ethereum, but much more quickly and cheaply.

When you delegate to a baker, they vote on your behalf in Tezos governance.  As the recent [vote](https://tzstats.com/election/35) on the [Ithaca proposal](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/announcing-tezos-9th-protocol-upgrade-proposal-ithaca.html) shows, this now matters for Tezos' future.

Therefore it's important to check your baker's voting behaviour and change your delegation if you disagree.

* Did they vote Yay to Ithaca, and you preferred Nay? Change baker.
* Did they vote Nay to Ithaca, and you preferred Yay? Change baker.
* Did they vote Pass (neutral), and you preferred Yay or Nay? Change baker.
* Are you holding on an exchange? Bad idea. Exchanges only vote Pass, if they vote at all. Find a wallet on [https://tezos.com/learn/store-and-use/](https://tezos.com/learn/store-and-use/) and move your XTZ there. Find a baker whose voting behaviour you agree with and delegate to them.

You can see how a baker voted on [tzstats.com](https://tzstats.com), under ""Votes"". Fx. that [Stakefish voted Yay](https://tzstats.com/tz2FCNBrERXtaTtNX6iimR1UJ5JSDxvdHM93#votes) to Ithaca, [Everstake voted Pass](https://tzstats.com/tz1aRoaRhSpRYvFdyvgWLL6TGyRoGF51wDjM#votes), and [PosDog voted Nay](https://tzstats.com/tz1VQnqCCqX4K5sP3FNkVSNKTdCAMJDd3E1n#votes) – while [Binance didn't vote at all](https://tzstats.com/tz1S8MNvuFEUsWgjHvi3AxibRBf388NhT1q2#votes).

Doing this, and encouraging others to do it, is completely uncontroversial. I have seen claims that this is a form of harassment. I am puzzled why they feel they should be able to wield power in the shadows and not be held accountable.

If you have voted for a politician, and they act in a way you disagree with, you vote for someone else next time. And you are of course free to encourage others to do the same.

Accountability is an absolutely essential part of good governance. Hold your baker accountable.","self","https://redd.it/s6tvwq"

2. No info on whether the commons or rares could be used at a later date
3. No listed time for the drop
4. No blocking of bots
5. They left the commons out there for 5 days which allowed bots to come in and claim all of the rares and still buy the commons at the same time. Essentially blocking out everyone who was trying to get the rares.
6. The tezos wallet for the epic asked for a zipcode!!! A what? Why would Kukai be able to provide a zipcode verification?!?!?
7. The Epics were purchased in minutes, and transactions went through even though they were reversed later.
8. Zero help or any discords or pages set up to talk about the project
9. a 10% royalty on objkt!!! WHAT?!?! Is this about branding or a money grab? Sure looks like they were expecting bots to pick all of them up and resell them for 10x. That means they got the original buy and then essentially another buy as they increased in price so quickly.

Horrible horrible first run for the GAP IMO.  So many more issues but these are certainly a minimal list. Anyone else have other experiences (that didn't use a bot to get a drop?)

The proposal didn’t make it due to the fact that the supermajority level of 80% or higher wasn’t met. A supermajority level of 80% means that at least 8 out of the 10 “yes” and “no” votes need to be a “yes” vote. Next to a “yes” and “no” vote, a voter can also vote “pass”. This means that the voter choses to vote, but want to stay neutral and therefore abstains from voting “yes” or “no”. Finally a voter can decide to not to vote at all. You may call this an “undecided” vote.

One can determine four major voting blocks. See figure. The Tezos Foundation as well as the Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS) voted “pass”. That is what they normally vote. They want to stay neutral and let the community decide on the progress direction of the chain. The exchanges (such as Coinbase, Kraken and Binance) always vote “pass” or “undedided”. They also let the community decide on the matter. They only contribute to the participation level of the vote. Only when a participation level of 53% or higher is met, the vote is valid. 

Leaves us with the last voting block, which are the public and private bakers. In the end, they decide whether of not this proposal qualified for the next period in the voting process. Due to a supermajority of around 78%, the proposal didn’t progress to the next period.

Furthermore, I was interested in the high number of more than 6500 “undecided” votes of the public&private baker block. I therefore tried to contact 15 bakers through their social contact addresses provided on the tzkt.io site. Five bakers responded on my email or twitter message.  Reasons for not voting were: “Sorry, but we are closing down our bakery.” “Oh, I was on a flight and had no time to vote.” “Yah, we don’t take part in the voting process.” 

I would encourage people who have delegated their tez to “undecided” vote bakers to think again and perhaps delegate their to another baker.","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9qT7HxlpqmkgJbK4LXSy1-Pvp7Z2ePhJOv4cpOXNaMs.jpg","https://redd.it/s9cllk"

For Ethereum, I've gathered that optimistic rollups are a layer 2 solution that will be used to lower gas fee's via a sort of ""side chain"" that seems like it will be a centralized solution(This seems a lot like Matic to me..).   I had a few questions regarding the implementation on Tezos, maybe the experts could hop in here and answer them so we can get more excitement built up.  If the language is too high level, other people can jump in to dumb it down for the average person.  


What would be an example of rollups we can see in current chains?  Would the interface look similar to Avax's wallet, you see there is 3 chains, x, p and c.  C chain is EVM(Ethereum compatable).  Then there is the other two chains, which I'm guessing would be the main AVAX chain and some staking chain etc.  Would the Tezos interface be similar to this? easy to swap between chains?

[AVAX main wallet](https://preview.redd.it/vpd63ukrgcd81.png?width=3180&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2c55cf3dae1acf99ee484b88df6053b6f5b8f37)

Another question, technically rollups are a L2 solution, does that mean they are a ""fork"" of Tezos, or are they just a scaled up server somewhere that takes care of all the transactions?  Will we have to run separate validator nodes for these rollups with an inflation stipend from the main chain? Or will they be privately funded with foundation funds?  


If we will have to run separate rollup nodes, what kind of specs would we be looking at, and what kind of decentralization would we be aiming for?  


With AVAX, fee's are relatively high on the EVM chain(usually costing about $1 per transaction), and really cheap on the main chain(X chain).  Will Tezos be able to take advantage of cheap Tezos gas fee's on the EVM roll-up?  Or by copying the EVM, would we essentially be absorbing it's disadvantages?  


Is it even worth for the community to pressure companies like Open Seat to integrate Tezos, when it will be so much easier for Open Sea when rollups are implemented?  


What are the most exciting features of optimistic rollups for the average users? How will it make their lives easier?","https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/h6C75qWoke8vQc-jTVdLxOVLOuELfZEAETXI8_BXUi0.jpg","https://redd.it/saihye"

Michelson is only the language it compiles to (similar to bytecode for solidity) - I am not a dev, so can be saying wrong things but I hope the core idea is here!

I wonder if there could be a **community push to fix this misconception**.I think a **pie chart** of the languages used would be very effective. And if we can compare this pie chart to other blockchains that would be even better (python has a huge market share so definitely a + point for Tezos!)

Could we try including the devs too? They seem to like coding on Tezos, but we don't have a lot of articles/twitter activity to share (because they are too busy building the ecosystem probably!)

If you have **ideas on how to spread the word or could help gathering data**, that would be super nice :)","self","https://redd.it/sc9vrt"

\- Pacific ocean, atlantic ocean, carribean, mediterranean, Indian ocean? I don´t know, somwehere. Why not build a future together, take responsibility in our own hands. I know it will be a long complicated proccess, but it is possible. We don´t have to start a new state/country necessarily, but we can at least create out own community. A safe haven for all Tezos supporters and community members. We can find a fertile island with good soil where we can grow fruit, vegetables and all other essentials. It´s ambitious, but do-able. It would also be a great marketing stunt. It would show that Tezos holders are ambitious and future oriented. We would work againt making the island a net positive in terms of enviromental and social factors. But we would have to have a limit on how many people can stay at the island at the same time of course.

Examples:

St. Thomas island, Greece. [https://www.privateislandsonline.com/europe/greece/st-thomas](https://www.privateislandsonline.com/europe/greece/st-thomas) $16Million

800-ACRE GOLFITO BAY PROPERTY, Costa Rica. [https://www.privateislandsonline.com/central-america/costa-rica/800-acre-golfito-bay-property](https://www.privateislandsonline.com/central-america/costa-rica/800-acre-golfito-bay-property) $17,5 million

&#x200B;

Would the Tezos foundation fund this lol? Just kidding, I know they won´t. But we could do it without them. Just wait for XTZ to pump > Community can togheter afford a island > start a long term project over 10 years to start development of the island > Make Tezos XTZ an official currency of the island > success > help the world.

What are your thoughts on whether Tezos should connect to Cosmos post-Tenderbake, and whether it is technically feasible? Callouts to u/NomadicLabs and u/murbard.

Having IBC transfers between Tezos and Cosmos-ecosystem projects would be pretty useful, e.g.:

1. We'd get to use the Cosmos <-> Ethereum bridge(s), e.g. Gravity. This would provide a nice alternative to WRAP for assets it doesn't provide.
2. Relatedly, we'd get many more assets to trade on our DEXs, likely increasing total XTZ liquidity.
3. We'd open up our thriving NFT markets to an ecosystem of chains with a lot of wealth that could buy our NFTs (Terra, Secret, Cosmos, and Osmosis are Cosmos-ecosystem chains which together have >10x the market cap and DeFi TVL of Tezos).
4. We'd get private smart contract execution via Secret as we wait for Sapling to come up to speed.
5. We'd be more visible to investors in the Cosmos ecosystem, which seems to be growing rapidly.

In terms of feasibility it doesn't seem crazy to me:

1. Apparently any chain can form a bridge with the Cosmos Hub so long as it supports fast finality (couldn't find the link I wanted, [but it's mentioned here](https://www.figment.io/resources/inter-blockchain-communication-ibc-is-coming-to-cosmos)).
2. Tenderbake, which is part of the Ithaca2 proposals, [is an adaptation of Tendermint](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/a-look-ahead-to-tenderbake.html), which is used by Cosmos.

Now that the uUSD/wUSDC pool has finished, outside of LB I don't know of any good pools to lock up value and yield arm. The TVL across all DeFi on Tezos is pathetically low to the point where it's hardly usable. It's in fact fairly worse than I remember not long after Kolibri and Quipuswap got going. I remember being able to trade fair amounts of kUSD for XTZ and back, and now it feels like a ""measly"" 1000 XTZ swap causes large slippage.

Youves has been doing some interesting things, but the problem with it like Kolibri is that it is AFAIK: retail driven? After a year of having no VC money nor TF help with TVL, we can see that retail alone isn't capable of providing deep liquidity on Tezos DeFi.

I'm just trying to figure out or understand what is being done to address this if not funding liquidity directly. Not being able to move funds between native tokens to more stable assets like BTC or stablecoins without causing huge slippage means that it's just not possible to do any business on this blockchain. For example I just tried to swap $1000 between kUSD and wUSDC back and forth, and ended up losing like 4% in the process. That's abysmal. This is a huge problem because unless TF is funding something, the odds of something choosing Tezos over a competitor like ATOM or AVAX are slim to none at this point - and not because tech may be lacking or superior, but simply because DeFi just doesn't work here beyond ""proof-of-concept"" or ""demo"" right now.

Most smart businesses will either hedge partially or even fully into stablecoins - and that's just not possible right now on this blockchain. It's possible to transfer XTZ into stablecoins (or just USD) externally, that's inefficiently compared to being able to just automate that process on-chain.

So yeah, what gives here? I'm clearly missing some greater goal in mind since funding liquidity directly has been facilitating growth tremendously on competitors. Does not that fall in line exactly with what TF is supposed to be doing? That is, facilitating the growth of the Tezos ecosystem? It feels like TF is leaving the glass half empty funding development of all of these tools but none of them are usable because there is no liquidity.

It's been nearly a year now, and Tezos hasn't built up any notable liquidity on its own, so what is being done to fix this?","self","https://redd.it/sf0bc3"

So, I have this nft on ""Sweet"" which I am trying to transfer to opensea. You can't do it through the app so I went on my laptop to see if I could do it there. It says I need to transfer it to an external tezos wallet. Before doing so it gives you this long warning about it possibly getting lost, etc. I don't want that to happen and I just don't know enough to feel comfortable with doing that much just yet so here I am. 

When I do transfer to an external tezos wallet, will I be able to transfer it directly to opensea using the metamask wallet. I have an Ethereum wallet set up already. Do I need to create a tezos wallet to transfer it or can I just link the already external tezos wallet to the meta mask wallet? I hope that makes sense. 

Once again, thank you for your help. Please be patient with me, I am quite new to this in general.","self","https://redd.it/sf9rsr"

I am using smartpy to store the website content in the contract byte storage. For viewing I am using breaking bad open web apis to fetch that storage and display it inside an iframe. And that's about it! Here is a demo of a 25kB site (cost 22USD) with some media, animations and interactive sound and a thematic manifesto...

I would be happy to get feedback as regard to (1) the concept - is this an interesting direction to pursue? (2) did you see similar efforts on Tezos or other chains? please note that i am interested here only in single payment models. that is, paying for space and not for space-time. any subscription model which will not survive the end-of-life of my bank account can not be ever-lasting. (3) technical aspects - can i make it simpler? am i doing anything not really necessary? are there more adequate frameworks/apis? is there a more efficient way to exploit the storage?  
Going forward i would like to consider how to go above the 32kB limit and how to allow one to upload ""diffs"" representing website updates. As a Tezos fanboy only recently have I learned that Avalanche, Cardano and Solana can also offer a similar price point as Tezos of 1USD/1kB while having a \~10x market cap (which i consider to be a loose indicator for the market's chances of long-term survival). Deso with 0.01 cent/kB also seems interesting.

If I transfer over my Tezos over to Coinbase Pro, will the staking still occur or is that only on the regular Coinbase app?

""The old proof-of-work method in confirming transactions on-chain consumes too much energy and sometimes contributes to the continued centralization of the network, according to Tezos’ founding ideas. Miners are required to power high-quality mining rigs in order to compete with other network miners. The biggest mining pools also contribute to centralization as they drown out other small miners in the network.

 DPoS is a good alternative to these concerns.
In the DPoS model, the task of maintaining the integrity of the blockchain is on the stakeholders, who are also XTZ token holders. While there is a minimum requirement of holding a certain amount of XTZ before anyone can be nominated as a network validator, anyone can delegate their XTZ to a chosen validator to take part in the efforts to secure the network.""

I know some people simply choose to stake or delegate to the biggest validator out there...do you see this as a problem? Many thanks 👍","self","https://redd.it/sj7yox"

In short, it's a great platform and I actually love the community and blockchain. The long answer is below....

It's definitely no secret that the Tezos blockchain has become a hotbed for NFT engagement. In the past 12 months, the blockchain has seen over 50,000 transactions a day, increased from 10,000 in January 2021 and NFT platforms have been a huge driver of that growth.

But out of all the blockchains and NFT platforms out there, why mint and sell your artwork on Tezos? I believe it is due to three main reasons. Eco-friendliness, low transaction costs, and a very strong NFT community.

\----------------------------------------------

**Eco-Friendly**

Compared to proof of work blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tezos validates transactions more efficiently through their Liquid Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol. Although PoS blockchains still utilize cryptography, their energy consumption is dramatically lower because miners do not need to solve extremely complex puzzles to prove their work on PoS blockchains.

So why would you mint your NFTs on Tezos? In short, Tezos is ecologically friendly and just as secure.

**Low Transaction Fees**

This should be fairly obvious. Tezos transactions cost about 0.0004 XTZ, which equates to around $0.0023. This allows NFTs of any value, big or small to be transacted, both easily and cheaply. If you're starting out in the space as an artist or creator and only selling your items for a small amount, this reduces the friction for a buyer to purchase your work.

A high transaction fee in addition to the various platform fees can eat through your earnings and make it economically unfeasible. This is why so many artists cut their NFT career short using Ethereum.

**Strong NFT Community**

The entire community on Tezos, and more specifically for NFTs are lively and inclusive. I can almost guarantee if you posted a question on their Twitter, you would receive an answer within the hour from someone in their community. The community has a strong love for art, tech, and the ecosystem as a whole. This is what makes or breaks a community-based space. Lack of community.

It’s quite an exciting time to be in the Tezos ecosystem and there is much, much more to come from it. This is only just the beginning. Don't be afraid to utilize other great blockchains for your projects, they will continue to prosper through the growth of this space.

Monolithic chains have stolen the limelight as of late but what they have gained in upfront specs they will prob lose in long term prospects.

Tezos is modular by design and is going after rollups with a special kind of tenacity. When you combine those two systems you might get what Kathleen Breitman recently referred to as “The Cadillac of blockchains” 

Although in the case of Tezos it might be more like Ali in the Rumble in the Jungle and the rope a dope — as Tezos plays the long game. Let these VCs sink hundreds of millions into DOOMED monolithic chains and meanwhile Tezos retail plays rope a dope.

Tezos is truly the people’s chain.

But it seems that whenever Tezos is mentioned in different contexts, it is referred to as a shitcoin, shit blockchain etc. I even have friends within the crypto space who assumed these things before i explained to them what Tezos actually was and what it can do. I don't know how this happened, but i believe that it is something that fundamentally holds Tezos back from significant growth (both with user base & price movements).   


Examples where i have seen these statemnets have been with F1 Mclaren and F1 RedBull when they announced their Tezos deals.. i just saw a new twitter post about a potential Sponsor deal with Manchester United and the tone is the same.

I was wondering if you all have been getting 1099s from Coinbase from staking your XTZ?  Staked Tezos that aren’t sold are basically unrealized gains but you can’t exactly just trash can a 1099. 

I’m trying to figure out if the 1099 I received is even from the XTZ, but I’m thinking it must be because all the other crypto amounts that I have kept online (in Coinbase) have basically just sat there. 

Obviously there are better places to stake your XTZ but I’ve basically just let mine sit there since we were originally able to claim our coins from the initial crowd sale.  Plus I like being able to see that stupid little ticker that shows the rewards. 

Another observation I’ve had with staking there is that it doesn’t seem to compound. Over the past couple of years the rewards have grown to an amount where you should be able to notice an increase in the rewards amount. Actually the rewards have seemingly decreased despite the actual rate that they say they’re on paying out has stayed the same.  Anyone else notice this too?","self","https://redd.it/slewu9"

&#x200B;

Ok, that's fast...

What's Impermanent Loss really?

Liquidity pool impermanent loss happens when the price of a token increases or decreases after you deposit them in a liquidity pool.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While providing liquidity to a liqidity pool, impermanent loss is bound to happen with the high market volatility.

&#x200B;

u/instaraise, just recently launched the #Litepaper for their DEX, and one of the detailed features is Impermanent loss Insurance.

&#x200B;

How does this work?

This Insurance works each day with 1% accrued daily.

To get a total of 100% Insurance, the Liquidity Provider will have to hold their position for 100 days, and if you decide to withdraw before our 30-Day cliff, you'd incur same Impermanent loss as normal.

&#x200B;

There's a reward for trusting the system with protecting your tokens, you get 100% compensation for any losss incurred during the first 100days or anytime hereafter, with your rewards and trading fess accrued during this period. 

And in a situation where there not enough tokens for complete payout, part of the insurance may be paid out in an equivalent value of $INSTA so be rest assured.

&#x200B;

What I couldn't quite breakthrough to the person was how big a difference in power usage there was between efficient POS chains vs POW. The argument always existed that it's still a waste and bad for the environment. Technically it's very simple to explain why this isn't the case but then I thought what's less ambiguous than saying it's energy efficient is to say it's carbon negative.

&#x200B;

[Quick Cost Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/5fe54rttq1h81.png?width=422&format=png&auto=webp&s=7081de0ca483af78a0676b9e2c66b87c27b7cbb6)

So what would it take to make Tezos an environmental asset? Turns out not much.

For \~90k, the network could be run carbon negative for 10 years. This is actually a very conservative value since actual Tezos network power usage is closer to 60MWh than 350. Ideally the carbon credits could be stored on blockchain for verification.

Now this makes very little real world impact, however for marketing purposes, I think there could be value in this. Might go a long way to dispel people associating all blockchains with being dirty.

The Tezos quorum calculation seems to imply that some proposal periods cannot reach quorum. Am I wrong, and if not, is this a design flaw?

For reference, the proposal amendment quorum calculation is `Q_{t+1} = 0.8 * Q_t + 0.2 * q_t` ([source](https://www.tezosagora.org/learn#the-supermajority-and-quorum-requirements)), where `Q_t` is the minimum quorum for period `t` and `q_t` is the achieved quorum for period `t`.

The problem with the formula is that it forces `Q_t` to increase monotonically (never decrease), else at least one proposal will fail to achieve the requirement `q_t >= Q_t`. As `Q_t` is bounded above by the fraction of active rolls, this means proposals *will* periodically fail to reach quorum. This seems like a design flaw - do we really want periodic dead periods?

If this is indeed a flaw, it could be fixed by adding a decay term to the quorum requirement, e.g. by saying quorum is achieved if `q_t >= 0.9 * Q_t`.

For tax reasons I would need to separate the baking rewards into another address that does not delegate (so I miss on the compound staking, but it seems it is more advantageous tax-wise for my situation in Germany).

By having the baking rewards in a different wallet not delegating it ensures the holding time for selling tax-free stays at 1 year instead of increasing to 10 years.

Is there the possibility for bakers to send the baking rewards to another address directly instead of the standard delegating address? Does anyone know of a baker that I could contact and delegate to them for arranging this?

My problem is that the ledger software does not let you swap Tezos, and it is not an EVM-token so I cannot use Metamask with my ledger to swap it. The only way I can think to get around this is to either sell it on my ledger or move it to an exchange like coinbase to swap/sell.

Long story short, my pending rewards balance is growing larger and larger. I receive the majority of what I would expect to receive every 3ish days, as intended. However, whatever fractional amount left over just goes into the pending rewards pile, which has slowly been growing larger and larger over the past few months. 

Here are my concerns due to my lack of knowledge, I'm an amateur, if even that.

If the pending rewards just keeps getting larger, will I ever get it?

Will it ever do a sweep payout of outstanding rewards, or will it just continue to give me the percentage it has been, dumping anything extra into the pending rewards?

I presume that if I stop staking, I will no longer receive rewards, even pending rewards.

The outstanding balance would take about 5 payouts to receive, if received in same quantities as normal rewards. Either way, just wondering if anyone else has noticed anything like that staking theirs, and if it is something I'm ignorant to or something I shouldn't worry about at all.

I understand there are different 'bakers' and all that so maybe its just something with the one I am using.","self","https://redd.it/swzv1l"

Hey guys,  
I wanted to share a really cool social meetup platform being built on Tezos testnet right now.  It seems similar to the Voxels/Roblox game they have on Ethereum and other chains.  Basically, you can build your own 3D metaverse using these blocks called ""voxels"", then you can invite your friends to chat and meet up with you to discuss things and have events.  You can decorate to impress!

[Build screen](https://preview.redd.it/0ghrkt20mzi81.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=484e0d58485d91af808d87d523cab974aa7f6431)

Currently it is just on testnet, but it is really fun to log in and build different things.  Since it's on testnet, it is free to try and you can get a feel for the game before it launches on mainnet on March 1st(first land sales happen).  The team has various prizes and rewards for early testers and adopters, so its a good chance to get your feet wet and possibly get some NFT goodies!

[In game screenshot!](https://preview.redd.it/gub1w9kbozi81.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ae6493a0fd1ce81ab9ebb007c877d1e3d22db86)

I plan on doing a youtube tutorial/review on this later this week, but if you would like more information in the meantime, please check out their wiki here:

[https://docs.stoneage.originx.games/](https://docs.stoneage.originx.games/)  


Be sure to ask for your own testnet land so you can try it out before it launches on Tezos mainnet!  If you have any further questions feel free to join the discord channel here.

I just came across the Ottez NFTset on Tezos (and purchased a few) and I could instantly tell this NFT set is going to be a big hit and I was surprised that I never really saw anything on it in the Tezos subreddit and when I searched it up it looked like the subreddit didn't take too kindly to it and had the same attitude that r/cc has towards NFTs. I understand a lot of NFT sets are money grabs and wont last but this set has already proven that it is not, it fits all the criteria to absolutely blow up alongside Tezos and I feel more people in this reddit should look into it and embrace it. Tezos has been lacking and slowly dropping on coinmarketcap and one reason for that has been its lack to capture DeFi and NFTs which looks like its been improving drastically but the community needs to embrace it more if Tezos is really going to succeed instead of trying to police these legit projects that are only bringing value and attention to Tezos. The first step towards real world adoption in smart contract platforms like Eth, Sol, XTZ, ADA is DeFi and NFT's and thats why SOL has done soo good and now ADA is starting to shit itself because regardless of the Tech these are what stops the chain from being ghost chains and having actual value until the tech is ready to go full mainstream adoption. I have been in Tezos from ICO days and I truly feel its undervalued and will eventually come time where its true value shows and when that time comes I expect the NFT sets tied early on with the project like these to do very well.

Also, don't tell me Tezzard are the Bored Ape Yacht Club of Tezos cause if anything they are Crypto Punks of Tezos, Ottez will be the BAYC of Tezos.","self","https://redd.it/t02g61"

I'm posting this because I personally struggled to understand yield farming and how to do it. In this guide, I will tell you how to continue to get staking rewards on your tezos while simultaneously loaning out your wrapped tezos (collateralized tezos) out on Plenty for more rewards.  

&#x200B;

A significant discovery for me was figuring out you can turn your Tezos into cTez (Essentially, you are locking up your Tezos and delegating it to your usual delegation address, and in turn, your Tezos can be collateralized as ctez and used in Defi apps!!! awesome) This cTez can be used on Plenty (ill provide links at the end) to create a liquidity pool and start lending out your cTez to borrowers to get percentages of the interest. 

First, you need a tezos wallet! I use [Kukai.app](https://Kukai.app)

2. Put some Tezos into it, then head over to [ctez.app](https://ctez.app) 

3. Link your tezos wallet and create an oven (don't worry at this point, there is no risk) In this oven you will see a delegation address! add your staking address, and if you don't have one look at [tezos.fish/leaderboard](https://tezos.fish/leaderboard) I just use stakefish's delegation address for now.

4. Put the tezos in the oven, and you will see that you now have the ability to mint cTez. This cTez that you mint will be available on other defi applications, and it may not look like you own it when you mint it (trust me, I thought I lost my ctez), but it is there! **You do not want to mint 100% of your tezos into ctez.** To start out, do 75%. This is safe, and it ensures your oven won't go under. 

5. Next, head over to [plentydefi.com](https://plentydefi.com) 

Link your wallet and use your ctez in the **Swap** section of the site under **Trade** to create equal parts ctez and plenty. So if you have 200 ctez, make 100 ctez worth of Plenty. so you have 100 ctez and x amount of plenty

6. Now, you want to head over to to the liquidity tab (still on the swap screen) and add a liquidity pair of cTez and Plenty. Once you max out your pair, you go over to the Farm tab of the plenty site.

7. Here on the Farm tab, you find ctez-Plenty, and you stake your liquidity!

8. Now, you wait as you slowly gain plenty tokens as a reward for participating in the lending program.

Once you want to leave, you harvest, and then you can swap your extra Plenty for coins of your choice (I would recommend ctez), and then you go back and burn your ctez to return your tezos! Boom increased overall yield, and you are now participating in tezos Defi :) 

I just did this so I could be somewhat off. If any experts have input on the process and its risk, please add below!!! Thanks, guys, and good luck.","self","https://redd.it/t5fchu"

This is prevalent across all major cryptos, although not all are as bad as Bitcoin. Having so few actors holding all the wealth is never good, and this is extremely true in the world of cryptocurrencies where decentralization can be key. 

With proof of stake coins like Tezos offering interest which can be a hedge against the built in inflation mechanism, this could be used in such a way to help flatten the wealth inequality over time. The interest that each user would recieve would be proportional to the amount of XTZ they have delegated per wallet address. So if someone owns 50% of the total XTZ supply, they would recieve less interest.

I don't know how much less or more interest users should recieve as a proportion of the total XTZ supply, that would be a question for someone smarter than me. I'm sure there is a sweet spot that would incentive the big players to continue staking and not leave, yet be small enough that it would flatten the inequality distribution over a long period of time.

I'm sure there are other things that could also be done such as preventing wallet addresses holding/staking over a certain amount which would force whales to split up their savings over multiple wallets thus making them receive a lower average interest rate. But I haven't thought too hard on the consequences of doing that.","self","https://redd.it/tbn3bk"

They created a great prototocol and attracted many investors whom funded the ICO and whom see Tezos only just remaining relevant by the virtue of its OCO funds.

Another sad day. So disappointing.","self","https://redd.it/tc2oow"

\*Addresses at the bottom\*

Hey r/tezos, 

I'm here to spread awareness and ask for the help of the greater community. In the early days of Tezos defi, [markusgp](https://twitter.com/Markusgp) created the TacoTruckToken, and together we transformed it into a [small community that was dedicated to supporting African Bakers](https://twitter.com/tz_Paisley/status/1390421230667370499?cxt=HHwWhsC44cKv4ssmAAAA). It started with delegating the TTT quipuswap pool to Tezos Cameroon, a bakery a part of the [Tezos Africa Foundation](https://tezosafrica.com/)/[Kuoka Project](https://kuoka.org/) funded by the Tezos Foundation. The ability to fund small bakeries with CMM pools was a novel idea only made possible by tezos' LPoS consensus algorithm. We started looking for other quipuswap pools to delegate to them, but over time, the pools became competitive and expensive to maintain. Large bakers were able to easily re-delegate to themselves, other exchanges, self custody ovens and wrapped tez removed the need to delegate dex pools. 

I continue to support Tezos Cameroon along with anonymous community members, but I would like to ask for support from the best crypto community to contend with the shift in the ecosystem. If you would like to support these bakers, you can delegate your wallet or Youves/Kolibri/ctez/wtez ovens. You can also create another wallet to delegate any amount you wish.  
 If you are interested in an NFT, myself and the extremely talented [YingYangYoeshi](https://twitter.com/yinyangyoeshi) have collaborated on a [very special non-fungible song](https://objkt.com/asset/KT1VHHVLsUG3soiYvhjTN6n6zK4frjBL9i6T/0). 80% of sales will go directly to Tezos Cameroon. Direct donations are also very impactful and appreciated.

Special thanks to Sebuh for his help with technical support 🌝

&#x200B;

So lets go ahead and break this down to what we know right now.

&#x200B;

Rocket Monsters has at this time accepted the offer! We will not be accepting the Tezos Grant as that is not how things are done here at RM. We feel this money can go to another Tezos project and hopefully they can grow with it. 

&#x200B;

Now let me say this firstly, your Rocket Monsters NFT game assets are safe! They will remain on Kalamint and the Gen Mint contract for now. We are currently working on building an in-game marketplace within the RM game to house all NFTs. The contracts for these will be on Harmony One when all is said and Done.

&#x200B;

We are also working towards a Token drop with Harmony, this will allow players to get some liquidity before the game launches! We will be going through an entire process here and we will walk this journey step by step with you. 

&#x200B;

The Land drop will happen on Harmony as well, there is a strong possibility it will be on [https://nftkey.app/](https://nftkey.app/). Within the next couple of weeks we will get everything setup so the pricing will be known and an official mint date will be made available

&#x200B;

We are still in full on game development currently working on the Space Outpost and the shops within that sector. We will also be finalizing and working on the Combat Systems as well. Nothing has changed on our game development side. We truly are expanding now and have White Glove treatment from here on out. We are also looking at 300k plus players coming aboard as we enter the Harmony One space. We will also have the PR support so many of you asked for, and wondered why it was not happening. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was not an overnight decision, it has been something that was deeply thought about. Tezos will always be where we started, but it is not where we will finish our journey. Please know that when I spoke with Harmony the Rocket Monsters community was the first thing I wanted to make sure was taken care of. The RM community is priority, and we assure you that you will be taken care of!

&#x200B;

I am sure there will be a ton of question as we go along, and in true RM transparency we will get those questions answered in a reasonable fashion. We do ask that you're patient with us as we move into a galaxy of new options. 

&#x200B;

Thank you all for joining us on this journey, we have a bright future and we will be the biggest blockchain game of our kind. All of you are at the beginning of a major breakthrough! HODL

With seven Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) live on Tezos at this moment, an eighth DEX would need to bring some serious innovation to the table to be able to seize a piece of the DeFi pie.
Insta DEX might be able to do just that. Insta DEX (By the Instaraise team) is trying to solve one of the most important reasons for users to be hesitant to provide liquidity which js impermanent loss.

Providing liquidity means that users submit tokens to a pool that is needed for a DEX to have functional trading pairs. For every trading pair, a liquidity pool is needed.

While traders make trades in the pool, the ratio of the token amounts changes because supply and demand changes the value of the tokens.

Due to certain dynamics, the total value of the tokens a user owns in a liquidity pool can become less compared to if the owner would have not submitted them in the liquidity pool. This is impermanent loss and i hope i explained it quite well!

However Insta DEX adds a different approach. Just like Bancor Protocol on Ethereum, Insta DEX is made in a way designed a liquidity provider always gets back the same value originally deposited ( plus trading fees and rewards ) through the concept called Impermanent Loss Insurance.

Another unique yet useful feature is Single asset liquidity provision. To provide liquidity, you do not have to put both the tokens in the pool. Instead you can provide liquidity in one token only.

I don’t know how much if an impact this DEX would make but surely it’s something different in Tezos","self","https://redd.it/tft3p9"

In December I liquidated a big portion of my bags that were mainly $ETH NFTs. Fast forward to March of 2022 I  re-entered with a fresh prospective and a new curiosity to learn. 

Towards the end of 2021 I started buying NFTs on $SOL to see what they were offering and to hedge against $ETH. I felt the projects weren’t that great but the functionality and price point were. Also there was lots of investment capital from legitimate companies.

In March of 2022, I found XTZ. There aren’t as many projects but the price point is definitely much more affordable then both and the functionality I feel is equal if not better than both. 

I feel like NFTs are where the internet was when it started. It’s a foot race to scale and to see who can develop the dominant platform. My example to this is yahoo. Yahoo at one point was the premier search engine and now it is almost non existent because of google and the technology advancements. 

It’s hard for me to see $ETH NFTS do well long term if gas problem isn’t solved. Right now they are by far the leader and the projects I am in have the most value without a question. But, for functionality and overall finished projects XTZ is extremely attractive compared to both.

I’m not sure how much “decentralization” will matter once regulation comes but right now XTZ has to be the bast alternative against $ETH.

$SOL mooned last year largely in part to NFTs and being a cheaper more functional alternative. 

I am placing bets on XTZ and think the same thing that happened to SOL could happen to XTZ. I am not an expert by any means but if crypto gaming and P2E keeps gaining steam this  blockchain seems to hit all the marks. 
I have a few questions I was hoping other could chime in on.

1. Is XTZ still cheap because adoption hasn’t happened yet? Of is it a function of their supply and overall tokenomics ?

2. Why have more companies and investors not built in this platform, or have they and the products not been released yet?

3. Am I missing anything that make XTZ a worse product then either in terms of security and capabilities ?

4. Is my hypothesis wrong, am I missing anything that could prevent mass adoption in the next few years?

5. Will XTZ be able to catch up to $ETH or are they already that far behind ?

I’d love to hear your thought.","self","https://redd.it/tg1izx"

While other crypto wallets require me to use a seed phrase, with ZenGo, I didn't get any passwords or seed phrases which is strange.

  
ZenGo uses your biometric data (fingerprint) to encrypt a key (password) which, half of it is on your phone and backup on cloud services, and the other half of the password is stored on ZenGo's server.  
In this way, no one besides you can control your crypto, but at the same time, your wallet is also recoverable, unlike cold wallets, which do not provide any backup if the password is lost.  
Being in charge of your own ""cold"" crypto wallet security comes with great responsibility, and human error could lead to theft or accidental deletion.

By using their wallet, you remove the need for a password, so you can never lose it, and you can never fall into phishing scams or any other password theft hacks that ask for your private key.

This is enabled by using a unique security model called MPC (Multi-Party Computation), which keeps the user's data hidden from the provider.  
ZenGo describes their security model in depth here: [https://zengo.com/security/](https://zengo.com/security/).","self","https://redd.it/tgoulq"

The platform seek to provide liquidity to small and micro-cap coins which will be a booster for new projects to launch in the Tezos ecosystem.

The InstaDEX by Instaraise team attempts to address one of the most significant reasons why consumers are unwilling to give liquidity: Impermanent loss.

Users contribute tokens to a liquidity pool, which is required for a DEX to have working trading pairings. A liquidity pool is required for each trading pair.

For example, a pool is formed for the XTZ – INSTA pair, where users can submit XTZ and INSTA tokens and receive a part of the trading fees that traders pay while making trades.

Because supply and demand affect the value of tokens, the ratio of toke quantities fluctuates when traders make deals in the pool.

The total worth of tokens a user possesses in a liquidity pool might become less as a result of certain dynamics than if the owner had not put them in the liquidity pool.

The value gained from a portion of the trading fees does not always entirely compensate for the tokens in the liquidity pool losing value.

Because liquidity is so important for a good trading pair, users are given incentives other than trading fees to offer liquidity.

Users can earn various tokens by using their liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens) in a yield farm. The Instaraise team will open yield farms for liquidity providers to numerous Liquidity Pools by full launch.

InstaDEX has a unique approach. Through a revolutionary concept dubbed Impermanent Loss Insurance, InstaDEX is meant to ensure that a liquidity provider always receives the same amount originally deposited (plus trading fees and rewards).

FEATURES OF INSTADEX INCLUDES:

1. Single asset liquidity provisioning

2. Impermanent loss protection","self","https://redd.it/tgyres"

I am trying to index NFTs on the FXHash GENTK contract and Versum Items contract but cannot find any library, rpc method, etc to query for transfers. I need to do so to update my app state to reflect current ownership data. I would like to avoid an indexer if possible. I guess I am wondering how indexers manage to do it. I am currently using Taquito (JS). Any tips or pointers would be much appreciated! Thanks","self","https://redd.it/tjoy06"

I like the innovations that come with InstaDex, a decentralized exchange built on Tezos. Some great features that I've picked out are the impermanent loss protection and single asset liquidity provisioning.

Some background: public minting is live right now for their first game which is a P2E version of Flappy Bird with a total supply of 10k ""Flappys"". Each Flappy gives you between 100 and 1000 arcade credits each week to play the game and a share of revenue distributed weekly. Additionally, the top 500 players each week receive rewards paid out in tez with the first week of play supposedly paying out 25k tez in total rewards (I think this scenario assumes a sellout).

With how active the NFT scene on Tezos is, I was expecting high demand for NFTs with clear utility but it looks like less than 200 out of 10k have been minted so far. 

Is this low demand from a lack of awareness/marketing? distrust in the team? no confidence in the vision? simply from not having a Discord? If you've made it this far, I'd love to hear your opinions on the project.

From my research about Tezos based platforms/ecosystems, in my humble opinion , I believe  Instaraise is really pulling a serious weight . I think Instaraise which tends to support new projects with their fundraising protocols is not slowing down anytime soon as you can see how they are firing on all gas cyclinder via a good innovation which they called InstaDEX.

According to the Instaraise project and my research , I got to find out that InstaDEX is like a normal DEX (Decentralized Exchange) with unique features that tends to give it a fair advantage over other Tezos DEXs. 

Of all, InstaDEX ability to give insurance against impermanent loss is basically a huge ""turn on' most especially for the liquidity providers. I think this is also beneficial to the tezos ecosystem as a whole as it will bringabout more liquidity flow in the ecosystem. Also, the ability to enable and approve  single assets for liquidity provisioning unlike the normal AMMs involving in Dual assets liquidity provisioning. This is to say that you can provide liquidity using a single token for example Insta token .

Well, lets keep our eyes on Instaraise and watch them closely. If. they are able to pull this off, then no doubt that it will definitely bring a huge change in the ecosystem.

I will love to hear your input","self","https://redd.it/tnjbwo"

**TrooperzGenesis lore :**

In 3042, humanity died out under mysterious conditions. From the ruins of the old world was born T-city, a cybernetic and dark city, plagued by injustice and corruption.

T-City was founded on the ruins of Nozomu (*“hope” in Japanese*), the last bastion of humanity.

Now the world belongs to the enigmatic T-Corp, a powerful corporation that has shaped T-City in its own image.

To survive in this sordid universe, Trooperz gather according to their skills to form 4 main gangs : Kabu, Aki, Shibu & Juku.

* Kabu : Smugglers, cybernetics tools sellers and arms dealers, rumors say that every deal made in T-ity benefits Kabu in one way or another.
* Aki: Theft and scam are their specialties, they never hesitate to trade their honor for money. It’s also rumored that Aki members perform weird scientific experiments.
* Shibu: hired killers and close combat experts, the Shibu’s will be your best allies if your intention is to eliminate a target.
* Juku: Cryptography experts and always ready to get a new cybernetic prosthesis. Hard to hide something from these guys.

Throughout the city, the Trooperz lead a merciless war in order to achieve their ultimate goal: the domination of T-City.

**What is TrooperzGenesis ?**

With over 20 layers & 400 hand-painted elements, each Trooperz is unique.

Juku, Shibu, Aki & Kabu: each faction will have exclusive items and each Trooperz their own skills.

Gather your team of 1 to 5 Trooperz and leave for adventure.

Each successful mission will give access to two kinds of rewards: XP and T-Coins.

XP allows Trooperz to be more powerful and will give you access to more difficult missions but with higher rewards.

T-Coins is a reward Token distributed to players upon successful completion of a mission. It allows you to purchase items in the marketplace like exclusive NFTs or collectibles to increase your chances of success in your next missions.

*It has to be noted that all T-Coins spent in the marketplace are burned.*

Trooperz Genesis is not only another pfp project. It's a universe in which NFTs and Tezos blockchain gave us the opportunity to create.

Made by NFTs Loverz for NFTs Loverz, we also want to create a new space to highlight Tezos artists and give them the opportunity to share their work.

**Launchin and minting :**

* Number of Trooperz : TBC,
* Minted on Tezos blockchain,
* Mint date will be confirmed soon,
* Collection will be available on Objkt.

Hey everyone! I work on the Tezos Wiki in my spare time, it's to the point now where I'm really getting things going, starting to making things look nice, and organized (next update). 

Here is the bounty -

TEZOS BOUNTY - 2 Tez.
Best description of WHAT IS a Tezos wallet. 

Requirements:
 - Describes how a wallet interacts with Web as non-technical as possible.
 - Convinces non crypto / crypto user alike that it is safe and easy to use.
 - Uses Kukai wallet as example. #Tezos L/S

I realize 2 Tez is not a ton(it's what I can afford), but I'll also be submitting the winner to the Tezos commons community award for helping me out, last time I made 50 Tez for working on the wiki, so I think you could make anywhere between 20-50 Tez depending on the reward ~ 60$ - 150$ RN.

I'll also supply a bonus 1 Tez if the description is fun and exciting 🎉. 

My hope with this is to get more people involved in the ecosystem. I hardly know anything about programming or GitHub and I was able to figure it out(kinda) 😂. For me it's mainly a learning experience, it helps the ecosystem, keeps me involved in the community, and a potential extra pay check! Any questions or comments are appreciated.

The bounty ends in two weeks. GL HF!","self","https://redd.it/tp50ch"

It can offer extremely low transaction fees, great throughput, and almost little carbon footprint. The network is not like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are proof-of-work blockchains.

Traders and Liquidity Providers can take use of unique trading features such as IL protection and single asset liquidity provisioning on the InstaDEX

Yes, the Bancor DEX has already promoted these functions. The inclusion of Instaraise, on the other hand, has the potential to completely transform the Tezos ecosystem.

Through a DEX offering, Instaraise is establishing itself as an even more important part of the Tezos ecosystem, potentially removing various flaws that have plagued previous Automated Market Makers (AMMs).

This is not a bug in the Ithaca2 protocol, nor in the Tenderbake consensus algorithm.      Octez v12.1 addresses an issue with the baker daemon for Ithaca2, tezos-baker-012-Psithaca, and how it interacts with other features shipped with this protocol upgrade. 

Bakers running v12.0 might experience crashes rendering them temporarily offline and unable to bake and (pre)endorse blocks. 

Reminder: Ithaca2 will activate this Friday on [\#Tezos](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tezos?src=hashtag_click)📷 mainnet. Nodes and bakers running Octez versions older than v12.0 will no longer be able to participate in the consensus.

Not only is the present Technological state extremely advanced, but the foundations of the code will enable a very bright future and way forward, currently seen as having the highest potential amongst all existing blockchains by non-baised thinkers (e.g. [https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1508502171238555649](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1508502171238555649)). While some important figures argue that the form of self governance can be manipulated and end up hurting the ecosystem (e.g. [https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1220920986234605570](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1220920986234605570)), that remains only a speculative issue that if needs be, can likely be amended.

Furthermore, the ability to evolve and specifically to become more efficient and less power consuming has brought a booming NFT scene, arguably one of the best, in least in terms of artistic 'vibe', originality and authentic grassroots adoption. It is likely that more tech advancements in the future will help onboard new unforeseen use cases and adoption. Not only that, as Arthur mentioned Tezos is selected and adopted in non-crypto worlds as the blockchain of choice ([https://twitter.com/ArthurB/status/1510347758368178179](https://twitter.com/ArthurB/status/1510347758368178179)).

So what's the problem you might think, Tezos is already on the path to 'victory' or 'winning'. What is the definition of winning in that regard? Winning is widespread adoption, it is becoming the blockchain of choice world wide, thus achieving the founders vision of becoming a true digital commonwealth and perhaps eventually attaining a store of value status.

Having a technological edge and bright technological future is sadly not enough to 'win'. Remember, winning is not being the most technologically advanced. That part is vital, but not enough. According to some prominent figures, the crypto space in large is the fastest technology to be ever adopted by the world (e.g. [https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1502638106335457284](https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1502638106335457284)). So, a critical factor for winning is the **speed of adoption** a blockchain succeeds to achieve. It is in fact a race. Arguably a very fast race. Having faster adoption means gaining ever growing **network effect** which contributes to even further adoption and popularity. Tezos being chosen by some companies out side of the crypto ecosystem is good news, but the scope and their commitment to Tezos is not clear. Furthermore, at least in the current primary state of the industry the crucial network effect is mostly established in the crypto space it self and not outside of it.

While Tezos' adoption rate improved massively in the past year, It is still at least one order of magnitude lesser than Ethereum in aspects of recognition, number of developers, market cap, number of users and apps etc. But it is not only Ethereum. One could argue that other blockchains are better off in regards to network effect in different kinds of measures. As network effect gap increases it growing harder and harder to keep pace with other competing blockchains and growing further and further away from achieving Tezos' goals. Having spend time and engaging with other blockchains one can see that they are also advancing, updating competing for adoption. While it is possible that tech advancements might make up for lower network effect - as time goes on the network effect gap is making it less and less likely.

Due to the immense speed of adoption rate in the crypto space and the current low adoption level Tezos has attained so far (compered to Ethereum and arguably other blockchains at least in terms of popularity but also factually in terms of total value locked in smart contracts and other measures of assessment) **short term goals of adoption is becoming increasingly more important over long term adoption goals** in order to stand a chance to close the gap in the adoption race. In other words while long term goals are obviously important loosing focus of short term adoption is a possible lost of long term overall goals.  It is vital to act as quickly as possible with an aggressive manner in order to stand a chance. 

I urge the community as a whole including the Tezos foundation members to consider doing anything in their power to drastically improve the rate of adoption including (and perhaps more importantly) in the crypto space it self. According to the the latest TF bi-anual report, the TF holds (as of Jan 2022) 1,163 million USD in assets of which 309 million USD in tez. Those funds exist can potentially be used in a direct fashion to incentive liquidity for instance, or be used in other ways to directly and aggressively help minimize the current network effect gap before the race is over.","self","https://redd.it/tv7dai"

Proof-of-stake blockchain Tezos deploys a revolutionary upgrade promising faster transactions, smoother-running dapps and prepares for highly anticipated scaling plans with rollups.

Ithaca 2, the ninth upgrade to the Tezos protocol, was activated.

New Tenderbake consensus algorithm lowers block times and improves finality.

Tezos ecosystem developers announce plans for upgrade proposals with high-throughput scaling solutions based on transaction and smart contract optimistic rollups -- paving the way for WebAssembly and EVM compatibility.

Tezos, one of the original and longest running Proof-of-Stake blockchains, has activated the ninth upgrade to the protocol, codenamed “Ithaca 2,” after being voted in by the Tezos community. Ithaca 2 replaces the current consensus algorithm (Emmy*) with Tenderbake – a revolutionary upgrade that sets the stage for a new era of innovation for the Tezos protocol. 

The new Tenderbake consensus algorithm enables lower block times, which will result in faster transactions and smoother-running applications on Tezos.

The Ithaca 2 upgrade is an unprecedented achievement for blockchains and open-source decentralized software, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Tezos governance framework which was created to enable dramatic changes in design. In addition to Tenderbake, Ithaca 2 further prepares the Tezos protocol for ambitious scalability plans such as rollups for WebAssembly and EVM compatibility with pre-checking, a lightweight validation scheme for the mempool which will increase overall throughput. Lastly, the Ithaca 2 upgrade will reduce the requirement to become a network validator (“baker”) by 25% from 8,000 tez to 6,000 tez, strengthening the decentralized nature of Tezos.

Designed to evolve, Tezos’ advanced governance framework allows it to integrate cutting-edge innovations from across the blockchain industry through its proven self-amendment mechanism. For example, shielded transactions from the Zcash Sapling protocol were introduced in the Edo upgrade, and the consensus algorithm Tenderbake, based on Tendermint from the Cosmos protocol, was introduced in the latest Ithaca 2 upgrade. A scaling announcement from Tezos ecosystem developers in March 2022 outlined proposals for optimistic rollups modeled on Arbitrum, a popular rollup system on Ethereum, and zk-rollups based on leading industry research. With these regular upgrades, Tezos continues to provide both best-in-class core technology and leading features across privacy, scalability, and security.

Over the last year Tezos has seen booming growth in user activity, with smart contract calls increasing per month from 100,000 in January 2021 to over 6.2 million in January 2022. Tezos continues to see adoption and momentum grow with landmark technical integrations by leading sports franchises and global brands such as Red Bull Racing, Manchester United, The Gap, Kia and more. By building on Tezos, industry leaders are showing their confidence in Tezos as the energy-efficient, low cost blockchain of choice for the Web3 revolution. Who wouldn't want to enjoy cross chain features and other incredible functionalities like NFT Marketplace- OpenSea, and Exeno Marketplace from Tezos? The adoption has been massive, unseen anywhere else.","self","https://redd.it/tv7tb4"

How can I interpret these figures? When does the TF run out of money? Suppose the larger investments are commitments for a period of three years and the TF continues to invest like they do as from March 2021, they will run out of money at the end of 2024.

Next to baking - the TF bakers bake roughly 4 million tez a year, which equals 16 million US dollars- what other major activities does the TF deploy to increase the assets held? Yeh, what can they do? Speculate on an enormous price increase of bitcoin and tez?

Hey everyone! I´m happy to say that there is great progress happening with the TezoTrooperz project. TezoTrooperz will be a RPG-Game with NFT´s, DAO, in-game marketplace and more. People holding REBL token will be able to vote in the DAO on new features and such. Every NFT will be on Tezos of course, and it will stay that way.

TezoTrooperz's goal is to continue building and growing its community for years to come, as well as to keep on improving the product. The vision is large and the timeframe is long term. The presale of Generation 0 NFTs starts on April 8. The game is still early in development afaik, but progress is being made here everyday. The team is serious and here for the long haul.

""TezoTrooperz is bringing gamification to NFTs through exclusive play-to-earn mechanics deployed on Tezos. A collection of **7.000 futuristic Trooperz** that will be needed to farm $REBL, the currency of the game. We find four different classes in The Alliance: **Warriors**, **Long Ranges**, **Troop Leaders**, and **Queens & Kings**. Each Trooperz will generate **a fixed daily return of $REBL Token** that will vary according to the faction""

I can say with confidence that the project is looking good. And also that the community is awesome as well as the team members. Hope to see more Tezos fans join this journey with TezoTrooperz!

There are many opportunities to explore where decentralized finance is concerned. InstaDEX being one of its kind tezos DEX will make room for single asset liquidity provision and impermanent loss protection as it has been designed in a way that the liquidity provider ends up getting back the original value deposited as well as trading fees and rewards.

This features bored by InstaDEX is truly rewarding such that it differs a lot of from other DEXs since it promises to eliminate several issues that have affected the traditional Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and have such embedding itself as an even more critical component of the Tezos ecosystem with its features.

I believe the InstaDEX is of highly intrinsic value and as such will face stern competition from other DEXs who will definitely copy the model and try to improve on it.

Have been out researching and checking out what could give Tezos ecosystem the spark they need for massive adoption and exposure, guess what, I have got a project for y'all to look out for.

&#x200B;

That's Instaraise, a project building DeFi universe on Tezos ecosystem, and with a great team.

&#x200B;

We've got quite a number of DEX on this blockchain (Tezos) , each with great attributes, but Instaraise is coming with a DEX with an entirely different mechanism and approach such that LPs will hugely benefit from it's incentive mechanism.

&#x200B;

Behind the scenes, since the Q1, the Instaraise team have been working on a DEX that will put on the table several offers for the Liquidity Providers including mitigating the risks involved in impermanent losses.

&#x200B;

InstaDex is a decentralized exchange which solves the problem of lack of liquidity in DEX. It provides incentives for token holder to provide liquidity for 30 days and more. This incentive mechanism will make  InstaDex as the most liquid DEX ever on the tezos blockchain, AND TELL YOU WHAT , AT DAY 100, all your losses(Impermanent wise) will be cleared with additional incentive (as in Swap fees etc. )

&#x200B;

Also another feature of this Dex is single assets liquidity provisioning, Instaraise is building a decentralized exchange that facilitates Single Assets Liquidity Provisioning like never before.

Thank you for your active involvement on the successful activation of Ithaca2, our 9th protocol upgrade and the most ambitious one so far.

Today we ask for your help to continue improving the protocol activation experience. We have prepared a survey aimed specially at bakers and tool developers -- but anyone running a Tezos node is more than welcome to answer:

[https://forms.gle/5hnutk99eDkNMuDQ8](https://forms.gle/5hnutk99eDkNMuDQ8)

This survey (which can be submitted anonymously) aims at assessing your overall experience with the protocol activation, and prompts you to describe any issues encountered. In particular, we ask contextual information regarding the issues certain bakers experienced when signing blocks and endorsements with Ledger hardware.

Moreover, it provides a way to send us logs from your nodes and bakers, and performance scraping information (e.g., from netdata or prometheus) if available.

This information will enable us to reflect on the experience with a richer data-set, perform due diligence, and also gather more intel about the diversity of hardware specs and node configurations on mainnet.

We kindly encourage you to fill out the form, and to contact us here (or on `#general-discussion` on the [Tezos Baking Slack](https://tezos-baking.slack.com/)) if you need help or assistance with this task. 

Thanks!","self","https://redd.it/tz5ll5"

During my research about this ecosystem, I came across a project, with their sole mission about helping new projects  get on their feet, by helping them to raise fund, build communities and turn their ideas into products etc, this project is Instaraise.

On their roadmap for 2022 Q2, is about building a DEX(called InstaDEX), one which will solve so many problems LPs in the conventional systems suffer.

Let's be realistic, right, I myself have suffered enough Impermanent Losses in this Conventional AMM systems, forgive me if I jump at this DEX promising something better.

&#x200B;

A Protection on Impermanent Loss, Single assets liquidity provisioning etc.

I'm sounding so learned because I have read the litepaper and its got a good mechanism and strategy to work this DEX out.

Lookup (@instaraise ) on twitter, check out their website and Telegram Channel.

More so, it has been hinted that they're close to launching the InstaDEX, I'd be heading over to MEXC Global to get some $INSTA tokens on the ready to test out the functionalities of this DEX,  you?","self","https://redd.it/u2am45"

There are good reasons for that, among which:

1. Owning your coins: letting your tez on an exchange means that they, ultimately, own your coins and you just have some kind of IOU stored in their database. As we say, not your keys, not your crypto!
2. Higher staking ROI: most exchanges let you stake your Tezos but apply a much higher fee than what you'd have on-chain. Coinbase offers 4.63% APY, Kraken offers 5%. This is significantly lower than what you'd get by delegating to a baker on-chain, even after deducting the baker's fees! As Tezos current staking rewards are around 6% APY, a baker which keeps a 5% fee still gives you more than 5.7% APY.
3. On top of that, one of Tezos best features is _liquid_ proof-of-stake, which means that you don't even have to lock your Tezos to earn dividends: you can delegate to a low-fee baker, use your Tezos and still earn the staking rewards corresponding to what you delegated.
4. Some exchanges are known for selling coins that they don't actually have. There's nothing worse for an exchange to have low liquidity: what if someone buys a lot of Tezos and then wants to withdraw it? Keeping your Tezos means that they have bigger reserves, even if you're not selling (remember, what you own is actually just an IOU!). By withwrading your Tezos from the exchange, you contribute to lowering their liquidity, preventing them to overselling it and could even force the price higher as the exchange could need to buy more!

Some subs such as /r/monero even organize runs, where they encourage their users to all withdraw their coins at the same date. We should really do the same!","self","https://redd.it/u43hm4"

We are pleased to have participated in the development of this proposed upgrade to Tezos alongside Marigold, TriliTech, Oxhead Alpha, Tarides, DaiLambda, Functori & Tweag.

A few highlights from Jakarta:

**TORUs**

Jakarta introduces Transactional Optimistic Rollups – a Layer 2 scaling solution built into the protocol. This is the first step of the recently outlined scaling strategy for #Tezos

Read more: https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/tezos-is-scaling.html

**Safer Sapling integration**

Another change is a new, safer design of the Sapling integration on Tezos. This addresses a recently announced vulnerability in the previous design. Find out more in our blog entry:

https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/fixing-the-sapling-protocol-integration.html

**Liquidity Baking Toggle Vote**

The upgrade proposal also introduces a new mechanism for signaling interest in Liquidity Baking. Tezos bakers can now vote ""On"", ""Off"", or ""Pass"" to the liquidity subsidy.

Further details in the TZIP: https://gitlab.com/tezos/tzip/-/blob/master/drafts/current/draft-symmetric-liquidity-baking-toggle-vote.md

**Also included with the Jakarta proposal:**

- Improvements to increase the security of the 'Tickets' feature and other updates to Michelson.

- Voting power for on-chain governance is no longer based on rolls, but rather on the full stake.","self","https://redd.it/u4uk1s"

As testnets are not strict environments (as in not having to worry about being careless), I still feel somewhat clueless as to what the general guidelines are when interacting with contracts other than my own. **For a smart contract I originate, I should know its entry points and behavior. For others contracts, not really**. Block explorers exist, having the contract's code and other pertinent information publicly available, but is it common for users to sightread, for example, the entire undocumented Michelson code to make sure the contract is safe? 

Having expressed my thoughts, I wonder if there is a “more friendly” or efficient way to study a smart contract (other than looking up it up in the block explorer) before attempting to communicate with it? Rather, is my concern even relevant? Are there generally resources, documentation, or even documented source code regarding commonly used smart contracts in the main network?

Tezos has a human readable VM.  The Ethereum VM is not human readable. This helps Tezos facilitate formal verification through its smart contract systems/VM and the Ethereum system does not.  1 point for Tezos

Tezos has liquid proof of stake which keeps the system decentralized.  Ethereum will have non-liquid proof of stake which will cause the system to centralize at third party delegation sites such as Lido, introducing centralization risk. 1 point for Tezos.

Tezos has enshrined rollups on their roadmap -- Ethereum does not have enshrined rollups on their roadmap. It will be more expensive to do rollup business on the Ethereum chain bc non-enshrined rollups will be more expensive interacting with the baselayer.  It will be harder to make it safe to go from layer 1 to layer 2 with non-enshrined rollups.  It will be more difficult to find a rollup Schelling point with many competing non-enshrined rollups.  1 point for Tezos.

Tezos has on-chain governance.  Ethereum has ""developer guided"" governance.  Both Tezos and Ethereum people think that the other side has centralized governance.  They are both trying to achieve decentralized governance.  You can argue it both ways.  The end result might be that both chains go through a similar process it is just that the Tezos system has a much better way of measuring consensus and this allows development to proceed faster -- it also makes integrating new things into the protocol layer easier, such as liquidity baking and enshrined rollups.  This means that PUBLIC GOODS are much easier to create on Tezos.  Tezos has public goods with liquidity baking, CTEZ, and soon will have it with enshrined rollups. 1 point for Tezos

Tezos has a cultural focus on reducing gas costs.  Ethereum has no cultural focus on reducing gas costs; gas gives Ethereum its value so culturally high gas prices are touted. Tezos has used clever math on at least four upgrades to consistently reduce gas and will continue doing this in the future.  Ethereum has no such push and uses paid gas as a badge of honor and as a way to value the network.  Tezos has a vibrant NFT community that would not be possible on Ethereum due to high gas costs. 1 point for Tezos.

Tezos has tickets.  Ethereum does not have tickets.  Tickets is a way to direct smart contract flow.  It can lead to novel uses such as helping with a safer way to move from layer 1 to layer 2, or creating an application that can read if a smart contract ""allowance"" is safe or is one that will drain your funds. 1 point for Tezos.

Tezos will soon be capable of 1000 tps at the base layer.  Ethereum can do 15.  Having a more capable baselayer is crucial for scaling (and having your rollups do more) and building a network that can be the settlement layer of the internet.  1 point for Tezos.

Why Ethereum is Better Than Tezos:

Ethereum was the first chain to introduce smart contracts.  It was first to market. It has the network effects with smart contracts. Tezos was second to market with smart contracts.  At first Tezos did not see itself as a competitor to Ethereum but rather as one to Bitcoin -- so it did not make the most of trying to create dapps and compete with Ethereum.  By the time it started to compete there were other players in the market. 1 point for Ethereum.

Ethereum has thot-leaders.  Ethereum has many thot-leaders who back each other up and create narratives and memes.  Tezos has a lack of thot-leaders. Part of this may be the gang mentality on Twitter and that it is dangerous to align yourself with anyone but the current winner in a category. 1 point for Ethereum.

Ethereum has the liquidity and VCs. Tezos has very little liquidity and VCs.  Liquidity and VC involvement is important because it leads to more developers building on your chain which then leads to more users -- and more users leads to greater network effects.  Greater network effects for a chain leads to a monetary premium for the base layer currency -- which then leads to more liquidity and it goes round and round. 1 point for Ethereum

Ethereum has a speculative premium because Ethereum is the place to go speculate.  Tezos does not have a speculative premium and very little speculation occurs.  Speculation is important because bubbles can sometimes lead to fundamental projects later down the line.  1 point for Ethereum.

What Hope Does Tezos Have to Win More Points?

Tezos need its technical superiority to eventually turn into more (1) thot-leading (2) liquidity (3) VC involvement with dapps and (4) a speculative premium.","self","https://redd.it/uavz4g"

A smart decision was to continue with tezos but I’m struggling to make connections.

Look, I rarely post but I’m certainly guilty of shit comments for moons, with the occasional half reasonable one.

I struggle with understanding whitepapers like others and I have been frustrated by the sheer number of blockchains, some promising, some doing, and some a mixture of both or none at all.

Apart from the name (which is just plain cool), tezos will be staying and growing as part of what I hope will be blockchains that serve to make a difference long into the future.

Some of the unfortunate background I am familiar with. Some of the similarities with Ethereum as well. The differences have been one reason for my decision, it does seem tezos may be one of the few truly permissionless blockchains with a good chance at being truly autonomous in the future, a long future perhaps as change can occur without hard forks which can cause rifts among the community.

If you have got this far thank you. Some of the partnerships are ok but where I am spending time with little success is in the Defi area coupled with wallets for IOS. 

There is obviously a lot less liquidity than SOL, ETH etc etc but that’s cool. I feel the fundamentals of tezos are only going to go from strength to strength alongside real world application, and not necessarily having to be an ETH killer at all to achieve this.

I want to add some liquidity as staking doesn’t seem enough to give to the growth of the dapps.
BTC, ETH, and tez are what I would like to provide.

I’ve opened apps that do the conversations etc but I would appreciate if anyone has suggestions about where tezos could best do with liquidity and or pools and reasons why.

And I’ll be straight up, sure, everyone wants to profit BUT that is not my prime motivation so please bear that in mind.

Regardless of the responses, it’s good to have made a commitment for the long term.

P.S. Website, links, podcasts from 2018 with developers etc have all contributed but I’m still finding it difficult to navigate and connect unlike some other holdings…..even though they have been liquidated in favour of tezos","self","https://redd.it/ubkdts"

Hello everyone!

**Encode Club** partnered up with **Tezos** and the purpose of [**Encode x Tezos partnership**](https://www.encode.club/tezos) is to educate people about Tezos and get them building!

Part of this partnership is a 4-week online hackathon. This hackathon is a great opportunity to learn, build and get onboarded into the Tezos ecosystem, as well as win great prizes! 🏆

As a part of this hackathon, Encode organised workshops to help hackers of this hackathon and other developers with their project building.

The first Hands-on dApp Training was fantastic, so Encode decided to organise another one with the same host—**Benjamin Fuentes**, tech lead of [**Marigold**](https://www.marigold.dev/)! 🚀

Tezos Hackathon: **Hands-on dApp Training 2** starts **today (28th April) at 4:30 pm GMT+1**! Register for the event here: [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/325639375137](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/325639375137)  

Join this event, take a technical deep-dive into Tezos technology and build your hackathon project along the way! 💻","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gUkQIWZp0HcSy7O1bPMS4u3DxhFVSlFzQ2PdQTbT7dQ.jpg","https://redd.it/udqbii"

InstaDEX is bringing some serious innovation to the table in the tezos ecosystem by  reducing LPs risk by bringing First Single Asset liquidity provisioning DEX Losses which will encourage more LPs to contribute and participate in liquidity provisions. Instead of staking two assets, a LP can only provide one asset in the pool and take exposure solely on it. Also, LPs have a choice to provide liquidity in the native token of the Instaraise, that is INSTA. Here, the asset provided will solely face the exposure, and LP will also receive trading fees and similar remunerations in the token staked.

Lets see how this turns out as the InstaDEX testnet is currently under final development.

We have hackathons for building dapps (most don’t make it to dapps but the code is opensource, eventually the code can be picked up), why not doing hackathon just for resources like code libraries etc? We could also add building a website that has all dev resources in one place (tutorials, community dev Tg and discord, code libraries). Make it in a way that the community will manage its development once the hackathon is finished. 

I also see a tremendous value in adding a job boards website since we see a lot of people that want to build on tezos but don’t know where to find devs.

Or is the XTZ there a bep20? There is no way to look that up in the account statements or what not, when you buy ETH you get the actual ERC20 and I was able to transfer that to my Metamask but it doesn't surprise me because BSC runs on the EVM so most likely their ETH, ETC, FTM and similar tokens are their specific versions to their blockchain standards but with Tezos I'm not sure. Thank you guys, I know its long but yeah, and btw if you ask why I don't just ""credit card"" my purchase directly on Kukai or Temple is because most of them use payment processors or payment rail intermediaries like Moonpay that for some reason don't accept credit cards from my country (Colombia) or ANY other that isn't the US.","self","https://redd.it/uh8akw"

It allows anyone who doesn't know about code to generate contracts (FA2 + crowdsale) for NFT collection. Now to launch your collection you just need to make a website and you're good to go.  


I am also thinking to allow users to be directly able to mint from the site itself thus making it really simple for the end-users.  


Any feedback is welcome. :)

EDIT:
What it does?
Let's say I want to launch my NFT collection on tezos, one way is to directly batch mint all my NFTs on objkt, right but when you want to do it through your own website and need ways to incentivize the early community (through presale) and not to mention want lazy minting then you will need a smart contract developer to code the contracts for you that contract is called crowdsale contract, with this site you can directly get those contract by filling a form.","self","https://redd.it/uho6j1"

Hey there I wanted to share a couple of thoughts on youves - currently the largest DeFi platform on Tezos. None of the facts/calculations should be considered financial advice, the reason why I’m sharing this is because I’m a huge fan of the platform and believe there to be a great opportunity for users not knowing the platform to get to know it.

Let me start with some basic facts:

* The youves platform has a governance token called YOU. Besides its governance aspects it also is the token that captures the platform’s value.
* This token was never sold in a public sale, initially the only way to get YOU was to earn it by interacting with the platform. 
* There was no pre-minting for the dev team. Only 11.11% of the minted tokens go to a treasury, the rest is distributed to the users. This leads to a highly decentralized situation where the treasury is not even the largest holder.
* Only a total of 4.68M YOU tokens will ever exist, half of which is minted the first 52 weeks.
* There is a halving every 52 weeks. The first halving will happen in 76 days (July 20th).
* An automatic mechanism called “unified staking” is going to launch any time now.
* Today it’s still possible to earn the YOU token on the platform, alternatively there is a reasonably liquid secondary market. The most liquid route from tez to YOU is: tez to uUSD on Quipuswap ([https://quipuswap.com/swap/tez-KT1XRPEPXbZK25r3Htzp2o1x7xdMMmfocKNW\_0](https://quipuswap.com/swap/tez-KT1XRPEPXbZK25r3Htzp2o1x7xdMMmfocKNW_0)) and then uUSD to YOU on Plenty ([https://www.plentydefi.com/swap?from=uUSD&to=YOU](https://www.plentydefi.com/swap?from=uUSD&to=YOU)).

Now why is this relevant? One play I have noticed users doing is mint synthetic assets, provide liquidity and earn YOU tokens. A simple example:

* I start with 1000 tez (current market price 2.8 USD per tez).
* 1000 tez are locked up in a youves vault and I mint the maximal amount 933 uUSD. There is a minting fee of 14.5 uUSD, we end up with 918.5 uUSD.
* The minting alone will make me eligible for 3.5 YOU per week, given the current minted amounts.
* There is an interest rate of 7.6% p.a. on my minted amount, this costs me 1.1 uUSD per week.
* At the moment the price of 1 YOU is 1 uUSD, meaning per week I make 3.5-1.1 = 2.4 USD profit. However I need to first deduct the 14.5 USD I paid when I minted. This means after ±6 weeks I’m starting to have a positive ROI.
* But there is more! I can choose to provide liquidity for a stable pair on a flat curve DEX. So I take my 918.5 uUSD, swap them for USDtz ([https://app.youves.com/swap](https://app.youves.com/swap)) and provide 918.5 USD worth of liquidity. This yields a rate of 28% p.a. in the long term farm ([https://app.youves.com/earn](https://app.youves.com/earn)).
* So fast forward to 1 year later (52 weeks for simplicity):
   * I invested 1000 tez. (https://app.youves.com/uusd/tez/minting/start)
   * I paid a minting fee of 14.5 USD
   * I paid a total interest rate of 71.5 USD (yes including compounding)
   * I earned 124.8 USD out of the minting activity
   * I earned 257.2 USD out of the liquidity provision
   * Summarized this is 296 USD net profit. 
* Oh and I almost forgot, meanwhile your 1,000 tez collateral kept on getting baking rewards from my favorite baker.

Of course there are risks involved. The most relevant one is if the tez price drops more than 33% I risk a liquidation. However I can exit the liquidity at any time and pay back my debt, thereby mitigating that risk. 

All of the numbers above assume no changes in the various parameters of the platform, like i.e. the YOU price staying at 1 USD. I believe that with the halving and automatic buy-back of YOU tokens the price will rise from 1 USD.","self","https://redd.it/uiysgb"

I'm new to both blockchain and Tezos. I've created an NFT from a PNG just to try and I'm not sure I've understood all the concepts under the hood.

As far as I understand, an NFT Collection (on Tezos) is a smart contract respecting the FA2 token standard.

This smart contract defines some operations that can be executed on Tezos.

Minting an NFT is preparing the metadata and the file itself and calling the \`\`\`**mint** operation on the smart contract to create one or more tokens, each one with an identifier and an URI.

The mint operation will add tokens to the Smart Contract.

Here are my questions:

\- Can we have a token without a smart contract ?

\- When a token is transferred from someone to someone else, it still ""belongs"" to the smart contract but the smart contract indicates that the token has been transferred ?

\- Can we transfer an NFT collection from someone to someone else ?

Thanks!","self","https://redd.it/uj0vcw"

As you may already be aware the Treasury put out a consultation paper that's due on 27th May. It's very long and not directly relevant to Tezos as its a decentralised platform and thankfully we are not in the crosshairs of regulation.

As a Tezos baker I strongly believe in self custody, yet realise not everyone want to self custody. I wrote a submission in hope that regulators don't make the licensing regime too strict for small business/brokers or people building centralised NFT marketplaces.

I welcome any suggestions or feedback.

How long until we get a first-class Rust-lang implementation of `tezos-node`?

I've recently been doing a lot of hacking in Rust, and it is truly a pleasure to work in. As a long-term fan of programming languages I think it might finally be the one that breaks through and replaces many of the garbage legacy languages we've been using for the past 40 years. OCaml is pretty nice, but I don't think many today would choose OCaml over Rust for a new project, or even an extensive refactor of an old project.

I know [TezEdge](https://github.com/tezedge/tezedge) is a thing, but it seems to be missing basic features. E.g. it doesn't appear to implement context updating logic ([add an op, get a new context and a receipt](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/blob/e06cf0305e3ba2ae20d5f5df6040072eb6cf3de3/src/proto_012_Psithaca/lib_delegate/baking_simulator.mli#L52)).

Consistent steady progress that moves the needle forward. The recent blog post about the roadmap on high throughput use cases and expanded smart contract functionality in making Tezos futureproof and the team has always consistently delivered (in terms of technological improvements) over the last few quarters.

[https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/tezos-is-scaling.html](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/tezos-is-scaling.html)

In addition, Arthur B and team have a track record of making consistently correct decisions on the technology. Unlike some big blockchains that have always felt like a ponzi scheme with something shiny over vaporware, Tezos is real under the hood.

**2) Adoption and Marketing**

While it does trail behind Ethereum in adoption, Tezos has secured some of the most high profile partnerships including OneOf (that has an exclusive partnership with the Grammys), the Ubisoft Quartz platform. In addition, Formula 1 racing (McLaren and Red Bull) have NFT projects using Tezos, Dogami (gaming) as well as high profile advertising/marketing partnerships with Manchester United (football), the Mets (baseball) as well as FloSports (E-Sports), the Art world and many more. There are 18+ corporate bakers and other institutions that are part of the Tezos ecosystem.

I have probably missed quite a few well known partnerships so please feel free to add them below.

**3) EU Blockchain**

This is an opinion and not a fact but the European Union does not like non EU tech companies to have monopoly in Europe and wherever possible they attempt to support their home grown solutions. This is true across both the government as well as European institutions and has been one of the reasons why we see a higher percentage of Tezos adoption in Europe. France is even more self-reliant in matters of national interest. I believe Tezos will get preferential support when it comes to adoption of blockchain technology in the EU.

It is always easy to criticize but it is very hard to chart our own unique vision in this competitive environment. While I have no idea about the price, I know for sure that Tezos will be around five years from now. Thank you Nomadic Labs and Tezos foundation for continuing to work on the Tezos blockchain!","self","https://redd.it/uo83b9"

The r/CryptoCurrency subreddit is hosting the Tezos Ecosystem Career Fair on Friday, May 20!

In this event on the most popular cryptocurrency subreddit on Reddit, you can explore job opportunities from teams that work in the Tezos ecosystem.

Who doesn’t want a job that puts bread on the table while taking part in the fastest evolving blockchain out there?

Anyone that is interested should check out the event this Friday. And even if you’re not on the market for a new job, as a Tezos supporter, it’s always a good thing to voice your positive thoughts on Tezos in general. So, make sure to check it out. 

Reddit

Reddit is one of the most popular websites in the world and ranked as the 9th most visited website worldwide in March this year.

“Reddit is a network of communities where people can dive into their interests, hobbies and passions. There’s a community for whatever you’re interested in on Reddit.”

Specific topics of interest are listed on user-created areas/forums called “subreddits”, where users can only post and discuss these specific topics. 

r/Cryptocurrency is a subreddit dedicated specifically to the topic of cryptocurrency.

With close to 5 million subscribers, it is the biggest and most active subreddit dedicated to cryptocurrency.

Although moderators of the sub can be tough (and we can imagine why with ~5 million subscribers and an average of 20,000 active users at any given time), Tezos related posts still manage to capture a good spot on the top page regularly (and we’re proud to say XTZ.News articles have featured in the past too).

It happened that Maximilian and I, we co-founded lately Dogami, which is this revisited Tamagotchi or Nintendogs with NFTs and augmented reality.

And so I decided to invite him so that we can share this safe space.

We'll be discussing about

* what inspired him.
* We'll try to understand who are his mentors and what drives his inspiration.
* we'll deep dive more into the offering of Dogami to its community.
* Max will share with us some insights around this community, the growth and the objectives for the end of the Year.
* And then we'll finish with some routines where we'll discuss some news of the week and I'll be asking some funny question to Max to see how he reacts.

PlentyDefi.com is launching a new Bridging system that enables liquidity bridging to Tezos in a decentralized yet easily usable fashion!

&#x200B;

[The bridge relies on an off-chain federation, called the Signers Quorum, which makes sure that at any given time the amount of tokens issued on Tezos corresponds to the amount of original tokens locked.](https://preview.redd.it/smu5c65hia091.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=d712d991427f197677c8da9ce684aaa527980845)

&#x200B;

Plenty's goal is to expand DeFi ""use cases"" on Tezos and steer it toward a full-scale DECENTRALIZED financial ecosystem. They are empowering traders, liquidity providers & developers to participate in an open financial marketplace.

&#x200B;

[At a high level, the bridge allows anyone to migrate their liquidity from multiple blockchains to Tezos, and deploy their liquidity on Tezos-native DeFi protocols](https://preview.redd.it/i6oo287jia091.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a0614f5df47b95606ab23d5b38d660760889df)

&#x200B;

The process can be slow and complicated. Even if a user does manage to migrate their liquidity, the DeFi options are limited and liquidity on Tezos is too scattered to use appropriately. The team at Plenty believes Bridging assets to Tezos needs to be a quick and easy process for users.

""Currently, Bridging liquidity from other blockchains to Tezos is a bad experience...""

Improving Tezos liquidity cant be done by only depending on adding bridges. Plenty believes the availability of derivative assets on Tezos itself needs to be improved as well. They aim to make it easy to create ""robocoins"" (tokens that track an external measure of value by using various feedback mechanisms to control its supply algorithmically) on the Tezos Ecosystem to help improve liquidity as well.

What do you think about the Plenty Bridge? Will this provide the Liquidity Tezos so desperately needs and what assets are you excited to see come to Tezos? Tell us down below!","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wB9ftFHP4tO8uZRHt0pNrK-CjgeIOn8Bs8n376wJujw.jpg","https://redd.it/uslg5q"

I've been chatting with them for a while and it was fun maybe the one called support would be actually good scam but unfortunately there were 3 people and all of them told me i have different problem. So even if i was dumb af i wouldn't fall for one of them.

And for other scammers don't try to contact me i got bored chatting with you dumb dumbs. One even literally asked me to fill in my seed phrase and that i will get some QR code so i send them atleast a rickroll in QR. (I think she(girl profile pic) didn't open it cause she is asking more questions cuz she dont see my seed phrase anywhere there)

Their names: tezos_support1 , Extreme-Detective-92 , Typical_Actuator_979

I know i didn't help anything with this cause nobody will read it anyways, but still felt the need to write it here.

Tezos blockchain's cheap gas prices make decentralized finance (DeFi) more enticing, because no one wants to spend their money on transaction fees. Instaraise's toolset covers many important areas of the Tezos ecosystem, making fundraising, single asset liquidity provision, and impermanent loss insurance much easier and possible. Instaraise is the first-ever decentralized Initial DEX Offering (IDO) platform built on top of Tezos, in case you didn't know.

Every blockchain ecosystem that is interested in the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) must provide adequate liquidity. Sourcing that liquidity can be difficult, but the infrastructure to address this is almost ready with the imminent release of InstaDEX by Instaraise. As a result, Tezos blockchain and its ecosystem will have access to innovative solutions as InstaDEX features will proffere these solutions and provide liquidity.

I saw several information about the launch Temple Wallet Mobile this week, that's a great news!

But I'm wondering on legitimacy of it: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.templewallet&gl=fr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.templewallet&gl=fr)

Is that the official one? The author of the application is indeed ""[Madfish.solutions](https://Madfish.solutions)"" but I think it strange that the application is available from May 20, 2022 while there are 2 hours u/Madfishsolutions explains that the application should be available this week ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/comments/uwq7py/comment/i9wugce/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) and two days ago ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/comments/uvzhs4/temple_wallet_mobile_version_soon_to_be/)) we are told ""More info on the wallet's features and future iOS release in the upcoming blog post."" While the application is already out.

I would therefore like to have confirmation if it is the communication error or if the available application is a scam.

See you :)

However, some Tezos DeFi platforms like Instaraise are gaining popularity, and now is a good time to check it out . 

As you already know, Builders, Creators, and Innovators participate in the Tezos Ecosystem. All are dedicated to expanding and improving the energy-efficient and upgradeable Tezos protocol.   Instaraise is one of the Tezos based projects making astonishing contributions in the ecosystem . It might interest you to know that for a long time, Instaraise has been developing fascinating ecosystem goods, one of which is upcoming -InstaDEX. 

InstaDEX is a one of a kind DEX on Tezos bearing Impermanent Loss Protection & Single Asset Liquidity Provisioning features. The DEX will soon be live on Testnet. It is obvious that there are certainly more problems that this DEX can now tackle considering its features. Whilst there are issues of impermanent loss, involuntary token exposure, Dual asset liquidity proviosong facing the traditional Automated Market Markets, the reversal will soon be the case with the coming of the DEX.

I think this DEX will bring in more liquidity to the Tezos ecosystem if the team is able to pull this invention  off. However, the Tezos ecosystem , liquidity providers and crypto space in general will be on the watch out to see how sustainable this is. Either way, lets anticipate the arrival and see how that pans out","self","https://redd.it/uz3swz"

It has been a while since are last update. Last year we started [MT Art House](https://www.mtarthouse.com]). Our original goal was to make a competitive NFT platform, but our focus has shifted from trying to grow it to helping artists create NFT projects. We will still operate our platform to show case creations from artists we support. We encourage our artist to host their projects on multiple Tezos NFT platforms and we will seek partnerships with said platforms. 

We have partnered with [NeverSceneStuff](https://neverscenefilms.com/) and [Paper Shoot](https://www.papershoot.com/) to create [Tokyo Addict: The Shibuya Crossing NFT Collection](https://tokyoaddict.com/shibuya-crossing). There are 50 NFTs available. When you mint a Shibuya Crossing NFT, you will receive a poster and a Paper Shoot case of the NFT image. NeverSceneStuff is the NFT brand of [Albert Ventura](https://neverscenefilms.com/), a Catalan filmmaker based in Taipei, Taiwan. [Paper Shoot](https://www.papershoot.com/) is a fun digital camera that does not have a screen. You have to load them from the SD card before you can see them. This makes the user focus on taking pictures and worry about the results later.

We also have a small collection of [Tokyo Addict and NeverSceneStuff hats](https://tokyoaddict.com/hat/form) available. They can be purchased with Tezos, but there is no NFT minting involved.

You may find the answer to some questions you have about Tokyo Addict at the [Tokyo Addict FAQs](https://tokyoaddict.com/faqs) page. Otherwise, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to us in this thread or at support@mtarthouse.com or sales@tokyoaddict.com.

ERX X SIRIHUB Revenue Distribution

While most banks have diminished interest rates on saving accounts to nothing or even negative rates, new financial products that utilize the Tezos blockchain allow both small and large investors to tap into the revenue generated in the real estate market.

STO exchange ERX has delivered on its first promise. Over 7,000 holders of the real-estate-backed token SIRIHUB have received revenue generated by rental income of the underlying asset.

You can find out more about the underlying assets here.

ERX is a Tezos-based exchange, created by Elevated Returns, and specifically designed to trade Security Token Offerings (STO).

STO’s are classified as securities and trading them will need to be done while following strict regulations. This can be done by implementing all the rules and restrictions of these regulations in the tokens through smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain

Plenty is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform on Tezos. Plenty offers several opportunities to earn through staking, farming, and adding liquidity.

At the beginning of this year, Plenty added a flat curve stable swap, which allows you to swap the XTZ wrapper cTez for XTZ with low slippage.  

Also earlier this year, Plenty announced that Plenty And Wrap Protocol would merge.  

Today, they have announced the successful launch of the Plenty bridge: a decentralized bridge between Ethereum and Tezos.

Through this bridge, users can transfer their tokens USDC, DAI, USDT, BUSD, WBTC, WETH, LINK, and/or MATIC to the Tezos blockchain and back in a decentralized manner.

Previously, the token transfer time was nearly an hour, but thanks to the quick finality of Tezos last upgrade the transfer takes just 5 minutes.

Bridges from Avalanche, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain will launch in the near future.

Your cards have attack points, defense points, special powers, and playing different cards can cost you a different amount of moves.

In this article Allen Walters dives into the gameplay to share his experiences and some of his own personal opinions.

In partnership with contemporary artist and former professional soccer player, Demit Omphroy, the experience kicks off with three gamified level drops: Common, Rare, and Epic. Each Common and Rare tell a story about different memorable experiences in Demit’s life, which build on each other to create his story. The pieces make up his individuality, which is then represented by his designs and his vision of the Gap logo in the collector’s special. These one-of-a-kind NFTs are vastly different in design from the last 2 drops, so don’t miss out.

Starting today, you can collect the Commons for a limited time at 2 tez (XTZ). Rares will be on sale starting June 9 at 12 PM ET for 8 tez (XTZ), and Epics on June 14 at 12 PM ET for 50 tez (XTZ). There will also be an auction on June 15 featuring single edition digital art and a custom, hand-painted Gap denim jacket by Demit.

The Tezos ecosystem partnership is growing gradually, starting from the partnership with Formula 1, Manchester United and now the USDT stablecoin is coming to Tezos.

Presently a lot of stablecoins like the UUSD for Youves, KUSD for Kolibri, and several other wrapped stables versions are available on Tezos.

The importance of stablecoins cannot be underestimated , especially in the current bear market. Stablecoins are inarguably the safe haven for investors during bear markets. 

Recently stablecoins have been on the trend after the UST crash, and having a trusted stablecoin that maintains its peg is of top priority to investors. 

The introduction of tether USDT to the Tezos ecosystem is a game-changer. It will further bring light to the various Defi projects in the Tezos ecosystem. What are the advantages?

* USDT is the largest stablecoin in terms of market share. Having a top centralized stablecoin with huge liquidity will be of great benefit to the ecosystem in general, especially for DeFi projects on Tezos like Kolibri, Youves, and Plenty.
* The integration will definitely bring new investors to the Tezos community especially for the speed and low transaction costs offered by the Tezos blockchain plus its self amending feature. Adoption of the USDT on tezos will give them exposure to other stable tokens on Tezos.
* USDT brings diversification to stablecoins on Tezos. While the majority of stablecoins on Tezos are crypto backed, the USDT however is a FIAT reserve backed stablecoin.
* The USDT introduction opens up new use cases for stablecoins and other tokens in the community.
* Users can now manage their exposure even with larger sizes on chain. 
* Finally, USDT could serve as collateral for tokens on lending/borrowing platforms like Youves and Kolibri. Having a trusted stablecoin as collateral would be interesting for these platforms, to add flexibility for users.

Hi, r/Tezos community!

  
In this post we’ll be talking about Tezos block explorer & how to access it. Info in this post will be extremely helpful for people that mine or trade $XTZ, as well as for those who want to develop on Tezos.  
Any cryptocurrency’s blockchain consists of nodes — full-fledged network participants who validate transactions in it. To do so, they dispose of a fully downloaded copy of the blockchain database and refresh it 24/7. A block explorer is a piece of software that connects to this database, derives all the information, and presents it in a human-readable way.

https://preview.redd.it/mgwql2n08e591.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1b7710bb1754494e034aee2754732febcd54d4d

A block explorer is the Google of a cryptocurrency — it allows you to see everything that is happening in its network. Thus, you can see any transaction’s status and its history, transacted amounts, wallet balances, block heights, lists of the richest wallets, sources and destination of funds, and much more. 

The main goal of creating Tezos was building a protocol that would be resistant to hard forks. In cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, splits happen in the network regarding the vision of updates that need to be implemented. This is followed by hard forks — the main chain is divided in two, and they start to act separately.   
One of the most frequently used Tezos block explorers is Tezblock. You can use Tezblock manually, as your $XTZ explorer for your personal needs. However, if you’re building a project like a wallet, an exchange, or an analytical platform on Tezos, you need constant access to databases in the XTZ explorer, and the data needs to be derived automatically.

[Chopper #1 on OBJKT](https://reddit.com/link/vckqcc/video/jq6myu48bp591/player)

The airdrop will be a collection of pictures of my face that have gathered throughout my life. This would be ""YOUR Theos Face"". It could be ""Baby Theo"", could be ""Superhero Theo"", or could be ""Homeless bum Theo"".

Looking for feedback regarding a concept that I am thinking would add value back to the broader community.

I myself am a victim of several crypto projects. No matter how deep the research is (reading whitepapers, checking if the team is doxxed and credible, tokenomics, etc.) the project always either seems to get rugged or its activity decays, followed by a slow asymptote to oblivion.

In Web2.0 fundraisers typically have their funds locked and released through time upon completion of certain objectives. Similar to the TradFi world, I reckon corporate financing would impose milestones and covenants for companies before fresh funds are being released to them (etc. When the building is 50% completed, release remaining funds to the construction company to finish building the remaining).

Shouldn't NFT projects have the same underlying mechanism too? Instead of giving them the entire mint proceeds, why not lock it in a treasury contract which the NFT holders can have access to view, and the power to vote via an on-chain governance mechanism such that if founders need access to the funds they can create a proposal for it and NFT holders will vote?

Ideal flow:

Project > DAO > Voting > Treasury Unlock

Why does it seem that most NFT project founders have 100% of the entire proceeds upon mint, and what's left is for the community to 'trust'. This reduces their incentives to hold onto the NFT as they do not really have a 'power or 'say' in the project -> which leads to speculators and bad actors being involved in the project.

To me, many launchpads out there aren't implementing such a mechanism.

My last question is, who decides these milestones? Should the NFT project decide the milestones, or should some third-party opinion weigh in? A parallel would be, does the construction company decides what % of completion should the funds be released, or does a third-party renowned architect/engineer provide his/her opinion?

P.S. I know that some VCs operate in a similar way. I don't know what goes behind a VC funding (whether the funds are locked up for the project treasury). But I am more specifically referring to the smaller projects","self","https://redd.it/vgdoh5"

The Jakarta protocol activates on Tezos mainnet [on June 28th](https://www.tezosagora.org/period/74)! Please, remember to update your infrastructure to Octez v13.0 / TezEdge v3!

The Octez baker daemon for Jakarta, `tezos-baker-013-PtJakart`, requires a mandatory command line flag to set up the baker’s default Liquidity Baking toggle vote value:

`--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote <vote>`

It also provides an optional `--votefile <file>` flag intended to be used to declare the path for a JSON file encoding the baker's voting preference and which, if present, overrides the default value set by the earlier `--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote` flag.

More details in the [Liquidity Baking documentation](https://tezos.gitlab.io/jakarta/liquidity_baking.html).

For those of you who don't already know, we have created a new website to showcase the Tezos ecosystem and its projects. We are looking to actively promote and market projects which list with us which sets us apart from other websites that have gone before us. The projects pay for the listing but most of this payment will be put towards marketing efforts.

&#x200B;

Check it out and please also give us a follow on Twitter. The more followers we get the more we will be able to attract new people to the Tezos blockchain. If you have any feedback let us know and hopefully we can be a real force in pushing Tezos out to the masses as we grow and the website develops.

Introducing the the 11th protocol Tezos upgrade proposal: 'Kathmandu' 🏔️

&#x200B;

This proposal is expected to include the following features:

&#x200B;

🎲 Improved randomness for distribution of baking rights

🔔 Event-logging, enabling off-chain systems to react to smart contract execution

📦 Validation pipelining:ongoing block validation tweaks to improve Tezos Layer 1 throughput

🧑‍🔬 Support for 'Ghostnet', a permanent testnet that upgrades with Mainnet

&#x200B;

The next step in the scaling strategy, Smart Contract Optimistic Rollups (SCORUs), will not be activated for Mainnet in this proposal, but will be available on 'Mondaynet' and 'Dailynet' testnets. This is part of a new approach to protocol development meant to ensure better coordination with ecosystem builders around major feature releases.

&#x200B;

A blog post with a more in-depth introduction to SCORUs is coming soon!

For any chain other than Tezos Mainnet, this mechanism lets the chain originator designate a special account, that can upgrade the protocol unilaterally with a new protocol proposal. Instead of going through the normal governance election cycles, the chain will upgrade straight away to the new protocol. This will allow for the creation of a long-running testnet, Ghostnet, where protocol upgrades will be centrally managed by Oxhead Alpha and which will closely follow Tezos mainnet upgrades.

If global interest rates hit 3-5% (or more), people will be able to keep their cash in risk-free savings accounts (earning 3%-5% annually). Why would anyone keep their wealth in coins like XTZ, which have high volatility/risk and no maximum coin cap? Genuinely curious.

Hi everyone,

As we know it, Tezos key differentiator in the L1 blockchain world is its ability to evolve, the protocol has already evolved 9 times and is about to it again on Tuesday.

This proposal is about building hype, expectations, awareness, PR and habit loops in blockchain users, similar to what Apple, Tesla or SpaceX do with their Keynotes, new products or rockets launches.

The format could be the following (approach similar to how tech company treat their new products)

* Setup a 30-60 minute group briefing with all the top press outlets
* Have a slide deck and 2-3 presenters that contributed to the new features explain them, giving context to why they’re important and how they’re different/better than what others are doing
* give one on one access to a reporter or two to dive deeper into different story angles such as how the upgrade process has evolved, enabling projects they’re working on the side (red bull, etc.), how certain challenges have been overcome, how contentious ones have played out, etc.
* see a live feed of the blocks production

Given our 3-4 upgrades per year, that’s an opportunity for a steady stream of storytelling and it’s cheap (earned media).

The pushback I have heard about so far are the following:

1. The switch of protocol may not happen during prime time US → should not matter, tezos is probably the least American blockchain! Or get rid of the live feed for block production and only present the new protocol features on prime time US.
2. What if it goes wrong → SpaceX crashes rockets all the time, Tesla truck got broken during the live event, and SpaceX and Tesla are still here…
3. Most of the time, big bakers dont update their software resulting in block production halted → great, if there was a big event in the calendar that thousands of people are hyped about, I am sure the big bakers would know about it and do their work on time.

What does the community think about this idea? Can this be communicated to Blokhaus, our in house marketing experts to get their feedback?

Thanks for your time and enjoy the Sunday 📷","self","https://redd.it/vl53w4"

With the Jakarta update Tezos is entering escape velocity.  Enshrined rolllups will be operational for the first time in crypto history -- and enshrined is just a roundabout way of saying -- actually belong to the chain and are not another chain.  So the TEZOS chain will be expanding.  It will not be outsourcing.  The network effects will stay intact.  The network will grow, not shrink or stagnate. 

How is Tezos able to pull this off so quickly?  Bc of years and years of optimal design decisions (and by not chasing dead-ends!)

&#x200B;

Not only that but in Jakarta ZK-privacy will be turned on. Plus a whole bunch of other cool updates.

&#x200B;

Then next upgrade after Jakarta Tezos will start a smart contract rollup testnet.  This is all escape velocity time.  It could take years for another chain to catch Tezos.  This is blue sky and green pastures time.  This is when the chickens come home to roost for centralized chains. (Bc hint you cant scale the internet with one server.  How did anyone ever think that was a good idea nevermind it undercuts everything a decentralized blockchain optimizes for?)

&#x200B;

Tezos has the best protocol developer teams by a mile: Nomadic Labs, Marigold, TriliTech, Oxhead Alpha, Tarides, DaiLambda, Functori & Tweag are all hot-shots. 

&#x200B;

More and more Tezos is entering into ""Are you not entertained?"" moments in the Colosseum. 

What does Tezos need?  More application developers and more users.  But these two groups will only be able to stay away from the benefits that Tezos offers for so long.  Remaining on other chains will be a combination of watching paint dry while getting hacked.  Who wants to watch paint dry and get hacked.  No one!  But that is what they will be doing until they join the excitement of Tezos and the safety of Tezos.  

Tezos is the way!  Buckle up because we are entering escape velocity -- and yes those little dots you see on the ground down there are all the blockchains we are leaving behind.","self","https://redd.it/vmm33g"

Congratulations to everyone! As Arthur said 'We've now taken the first of three steps in massively scaling Tezos' transaction capacity, without compromising on decentralization. ' The latest Jakarta upgrade has brought a massive scaling solution which will help Tezos ecosystem to '  be ahead of the game on scaling. '

[Tezos upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/3fx09ytyns891.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30b1e4b366a385e293af287e5d70680d2041b574)

Let's have a quick look at the main feature:

**Transaction optimistic rollups** are a scaling solution for Tezos. Optimistic rollups enable higher throughput (TPS) by moving the validation of TX away from the main chain, to ‘Layer 2’. They work on the assumption that validation is correct until explicitly proven otherwise

Tezos rollups will not be implemented as smart contracts, but rather natively in the economic protocol — making them enshrined rollupsLeveraging Tezos’ unique self-amendment feature this way allows the implementation of more efficient, expressive, and scalable solutions.

Jakarta protocol proposal redefines the computation of delegates’ voting power in the self-amendment process. Instead of being measured in terms of rolls, it is now defined directly by the delegate’s stake. As result, the notion of rolls is no longer relevant and has been deprecated

There are even more changes that Jakarta introduces:

\- Tickets hardening  
\- A safer Sapling integration  
\- New Liquidity Baking voting  
\- Michelson interpreter improvements

I'm hosting it through my project: [Ring Worlds](https://www.twitter.com/nftringworlds) and the speaker of this space will be [PC84](https://twitter.com/Pc8417) (ex. Host of Tezos Artcast and a very kind overall human being)

So we invite you to join us on the 5th of July @ 14:30 UTC and be a part of this amazing talk we gonna have alongside great projects and Artists that include: [Flygohr](https://twitter.com/Flygohr), [Bunny Knights](https://twitter.com/BunnyKnights), [AdAstra](https://twitter.com/AdAstraTheGame), [Merchant](https://twitter.com/merchant_tez), [Grail NFT](https://twitter.com/GrailNFTProject) and [Knights of Tezonia](https://twitter.com/KnghtsOfTezonia)

Moreover, it provides a way to send us logs from your nodes and bakers, and performance scraping information (e.g., from netdata or prometheus) if available.

This information will enable us to reflect on the experience with a richer data-set, perform due diligence, and also gather more intel about the diversity of hardware and node configurations on mainnet.

Globacap

Globacap are an FCA regulated London-based UK firm specializing in unlocking private capital markets.

The company was founded to ‘…use emerging blockchain technology to completely change the underlying processes behind private capital markets’.  

Private capital markets grew to more than $7tn in 2021 and have shown explosive growth recently as investors look for higher returns.

Private markets are still dwarfed by the traditional asset management industry and are known to be inefficient in application, however, Globacap uses blockchain technology to reshape how private markets can operate, enabling transactions that rival the efficiency of public markets.

Back in 2019, Globacap partnered with the Tezos Foundation to take private markets to the next stage of evolution.

Now, Globacap has announced the launch of the world’s first blockchain-based algae biomass project developed and operated by Sustainable Impact Token (SIT).

Let's start with the main facts about Tezos itself ⤵️

🤝 Tezos is a blockchain using the Liquid Proof of Stake consensus algorithm.  
👨‍🍳 Staking on Tezos is called baking. The minimum stake amount is 6,000 XTZ, and the baking yield reaches 6% annually.  
🔁 The main feature of Tezos is upgradability. Core developers submit a new protocol update every three months and bakers adopt it synchronously.  
✅ Updates enable Tezos to do anything: fix a small bug, optimize transaction fees, add new blockchain primitives, or even change the consensus algorithm.  
🤑 Tezos token is called XTZ, but tez is also widespread. The current amount is 922 million XTZ.  


Dozens of applications run on Tezos: algorithmic stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, farms, NFT marketplaces, blockchain games, and various tools. We’ll talk more about it and the development process in the following posts. So subscribe and comment so you don’t miss anything! ☺️","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/EEYCuE6K84dQlWXGJcRLA5DWJjhNnK5nzrwSMAz9ZZA.jpg","https://redd.it/vstzmt"

The Tezos blockchain network is one of the few blockchains with unique characteristics that are said to top major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

 It is one of the most popular open-source chains which executes P2P transactions and deploys smart contracts, having a large influence on other major cryptocurrencies like Cardano, and Gocoin as well as upcoming cryptocurrencies like Zetrix blockchain which uses cross-chain technologies to facilitate smart contracts, scalability, and security of enterprises globally. 

According to The CoinRepublic, The #1of1 NFT event will bring NFT changes on the Tezos blockchain, as digital art galleries will be featured in other metaverse spaces and Tezos institution projects like The Tickle and the Here and Now Project.","self","https://redd.it/vsxho6"

This week we launched our first ever talk on the topic of RPGs on #tezos, we aren't sure if this is going to be a repeatable thing but we would love to hear your opinion on the matter!

The event itself was very successful as far as numbers go and we got to engage some people with projects on tezos. 

One question as well was how to setup a mobile wallet because someone was very interested in joining some of the projects on our wonderful, everevolving blockchain, that made me really happy to be frank.

 Some numbers:  
\- Attended live: **79**   
\- Listened to the Recording: **63**  
\- Total Space Runtime: **2h 29m 30s**

[Ring Worlds Twitter](https://twitter.com/NFTRingWorlds)  
Now these numbers in comparison to what our small Follower base is: 465 Followers (at the time of writing) are very good numbers. It helped a lot the fact that people who were engaged with the event mainly speakers shared the event and we planned a week long marketing strategy to showcase every individual project for each day we wait for the event to start.

We setup the website, which we unfortunately didn't have the time to setup analytics for so we didn't grab any data from that point. The projects that participated reported some secondary and primary sales on their NFTs after the space and they all saw an increase in their followers.

[A tweet from Merchant](https://twitter.com/merchant_tez/status/1544419216606076928?s=20&t=JYd9OedJ39Q1NpcsgA79uQ) (one of our speakers) stating that he just passed the 200 follower mark.

[A tweet from Merchant stating that he just passed the 200 follower mark.](https://preview.redd.it/zc59h0uueba91.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=703051042d206ab514b0455e6546c4131d0f90b0)

We share this data with you to encourage the community to plan such events and engage with ongoing projects that might not have the same traction as others more successful projects. People in our space seem genuinely interested during these times to learn how creators go through the bear market, and they also need to have a security feel-safe state that encourages them to find new projects that can be part of.

Lastly we downloaded the recorded space and posted it on youtube where it can be archived for ever in order for people can find information on these projects, or even act as a historical archive when these projects that we spoke to, have grown even bigger. [\[Link to the YT video\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VREj0-16Tao)

You can find the recording of the our Space on our website, specially designed for this event: [https://talks.ringworlds.com](https://talks.ringworlds.com)

&#x200B;

Again we would love to hear from you, listen to your ideas and even help if something comes up that we think we can help. All of the speakers were thrilled to participate and the great response from the people really gave us hope and strength to keep on building even more during these hard times.

&#x200B;

A big thanks to all the projects that took time off of their busy schedules to come talk for 2:30 hours.

I have loved Tezos for a while now.  The community has been great and it seems like the people's network among many other corporate networks disguised as people's network (like maybe Solana?).

Recently, I decided to try my hand at baking.  I'm reasonably technical but by far not so much on the software/coding/networking.  I have run other nodes on other networks.  I wanted a simple, secure set up using easy to follow instructions.

I bought a Mac to segregate to only use for baking since my first choice to create the bakery was Kiln (it seems to be pushed the most by Tezos).  I've been troubleshooting for a while now.  Support seems to be sporadic...not sure they are very active or not....don't seem to care to keep this as an easy to use program to simplify the baking process.  I don't have the skills to help them fix their program, but they seem to want help.  If it doesn't work for someone like me, something is wrong.  If its not the best solution then maybe it shouldn't be recommended as the Easiest.

Many other instructions to set up bakery are at least two years out of date...links are broken...not up to date...inaccurate...there's just not simple easy to follow instructions.  Or there's no date, no recommends.  I'm not sure which is the best.  Tezos node Discord pins are over 2 years old.  Other recommendations seems to have newer, untried untrue copycats...maybe with middleware that worry me (not that its not safe, just that I don't know if its safe or not).  Everything is a mess with no order.

Because of this I really really hate to say this, but I'm losing my faith in Tezos long term.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  I really wanted to stick with this long term and create a bakery and support the network.  But I think I might take my investment to another chain and try something else.  

I want to stay, truly...what's going on?  Are the founders and Tezos foundation still passionate about this?  Why is there no easy, up to date onboarding for new bakers (or what am I missing?)  Any advice?  I'm not at all trying to spread FUD just pointing out my frustration and looking for guidance.  Thank you.","self","https://redd.it/vvt0dv"

They are a platform for running any software and having all computation made verifiable on the Tezos blockchain.

Read all about them in [our new blog post](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/next-generation-rollups.html).  

Main points:

* Optimistic rollups on Tezos will be completely generic: a general computation base layer with special 'proof-generating' virtual machines.
* The first virtual machine for Tezos rollups will run WebAssembly/Wasm, welcoming C/C++, Rust, Go, and AssemblyScript developer communities. But any execution environment can be supported.
* All rollup functionality comes with user-installed 'kernels': Rollup operating systems compiled to Wasm. Support for Michelson and the EVM can be added through kernels or with new virtual machines added in future Tezos protocol upgrades.
* We invite builders to develop their own, innovative kernels for Tezos rollups. For this we provide tools for token exchanges between L1 and L2, interaction with L1 contracts, gas monitoring, self-governance and more.
* We also provide safe Rust bindings to the proof-generating VM.  The point is to let kernel developers think less about blocks and I/O on the blockchain and more about the applications they want do build.
* We believe this design puts Tezos rollups solidly at the forefront of blockchain tech, offering everything that parachains, subnets, app-chains and similar solutions do. All while being secured by a time-tested, decentralized and censorship resistant L1: the Tezos main chain.
* Wasm rollups are under active development on the Mondaynet testnet, and will remain under continuous development.  The community's testing and experimenting will be of great help in getting this major step in Tezos evolution ready for mainnet 🚀","self","https://redd.it/vwntx4"

The main reason is so that your native currency is used as a store of value (the other reasons will not be touched upon here).  There are also many reasons to pretend to maximize decentralization while taking short-cuts and using many centralized methods.  We see this all the time in crypto.  It is a form of marketing.  It works because decentralization is a sliding scale and there is no such thing as ""perfect decentralization.""  Someone can always find a chink in the armor somewhere and so say ""See you are not perfectly decentralized and so it is okay that our chain does this centralized thing""

Also people define decentralization in different ways.  I think it makes the most sense to prioritize different aspects of a chain and their impact on decentralization.  The most important aspect due to the impact that it has on a chains state of affairs is the governance system. Every chain has governance.  ""Our chain has no governance"" just means they have centralized governance and do not want to talk about it -- because pretending to be decentralized is good marketing.

The second aspect is whether it is pemissionless or permissioned to validate blocks and the economic reality of doing this such as the hardware required. Believe it or not on some chains you need to get permission and say KYC to do this: Solana is one example.  This is another massive centralized gateway that no amount of ""pay no attention to the man behind the curtain"" will do away with. Also do you need at data center to validate blocks or at the decentralized extreme can you do it with a raspberry pi?

The third aspect is twofold (a) the number of validators in the network and (b) whether there are incentives for splitting validators. (Also is your chain beholden to a mulit-sig could be inserted here as well). This is more a performance metric than a design metric (unless beholden to a multi-sig) and so is not nearly as important as aspects one and two as it can always change, and so in practice does a better job of measure the distribution of the network rather than its decentralization as a system: think of it as snapshot in time. This is also the most popular way of measuring decentralization -- we see thot leaders claiming aspect three as the be-all-end-all all the time.

The fourth aspect (in diminishing importance to centralization v decentralization) is the front man risk.  Is one person calling all the shots?  Is he (there are no females doing this) directing the crowd to do his bidding. There really is not a chain in existence without a front man.  Even in Bitcoin, Satoshi still directs via his writings from beyond the grave (or wherever he is -- tho I guess Satoshi could be a female)

The fifth aspect is twofold (a) number of completed projects (non-functioning projects do not matter) and (b) variety of projects such as financial, art-based, social, etc.

The sixth aspect is the number of developers building on the chain.  This matters very little because it can always change depending on the popularity of the chain or speculative interests.

There are some other aspects you could probably drag up like tooling and how this promotes global building, but each thing you drag up will be of diminishing importance.

If I had to guess I would say in order adding up to 100 percent that the first aspect counts for 50 percent, the second aspect for 40, the third for 5 and the remainder for the final 5 percent. So it is the first two or three aspects that make up the lion's share of the difference but people will use the existence of other aspects to help muddy the water and say things like ""there is no way to perfectly measure decentralization"" and then use that fact to justify why their overly centralized chain is actually decentralized because it seemingly scores high on one aspect they would like to highlight.

So the elephant in the room is the first aspect.  People like the hand-wave this one away.  Also you have to remember that people have different skill-sets and just because someone is gifted with coding and network design does not mean they have determined the optimal way to decentralize a global blockchain.  Also memes can infect blockchain architects too.  It is the case that the prevailing idea is that a chain that depends on coin-voting is not decentralized and that a chain that has ""no-governance"" is decentralized -- which needless to say is the opposite of reality and will be recognized by blockchain thinkers as a ""duh no brainer"" thing someday.

But we have already pointed out it is impossible to have no governance.  If you have no governance then your chain has ossified but all chains are still capable of change, so there must be a form of governance to direct these existing chains.  Ethereum and Bitcoin start out with decentralized governance (anyone can suggest a change) but they end with a glaring central point of failure (core devs must decide what to push through).  They can claim not to decide which side of the fork people run and yes that is true but they can affect many things depending on what they decide not to push through.  And even on what they push through they are in some sense ""pushing a button"" -- so there is regulatory risk.  Bitcoin maintainers complain about this (and other risks such as maintainer infiltration:  [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524) )  Also they are humans and the humans will change over time and there is always the chance of a rogue cabal taking over.  People talk about Bitcoin lasting for 100 years or more -- but can they be certain that those running it will have the best interest of the chain at heart for 100 years or more?  How can they be certain?  What checks and balances are in place?  Human nature is tricky.  This is a massive centralization risk to just allow this small group to have so much sway.  Of course at first everything will go swimmingly as everyone is on the same page -- but as time marches forward how can we be certain this will remain the case.  Things change.  These core devs on Bitcoin are not even paid.  And on Ethereum they are not paid much.  What if the Ethereum L2s, the non-enshrined rollups, become more important than the L1?  How will that effect decision making?  Is there a system in place to prevent this -- or is the only thing preventing it the human and changing core devs?  What a small centralized group to be directing the affairs of billions, maybe even trillions, of dollars.  Shouldn't there be a system in place? One with checks and balances?

Tezos has a good one: it keeps governance decentralized and so keeps the chain decentralized.  Anyone can suggest a change but only the most popular suggestion makes it to the next round.  Multiple teams can work on the change.  They can bill the protocol itself for the work.  Everyone either votes or they can delegate their vote (that is their choice) and a quorum must be hit for it to go to the next round.  For it to be finalized a super-majority must agree to it.  This system is capable of polling the community at large.  The tez token serves as the proxy measuring all who belong to the network. The entire network is pushing changes, working as one hive-mind.

Sometimes detractors will say things like ""But with coin-voting you don't count all the other groups who matter like the dapp builders and the users of the chain etc.""  A better way to look at this is that with coin-voting you use the best measure that serves as a proxy for all groups in the network, the native token.  If you start polling people who do not own tokens how can you recognize friend from foe?  It could be a competitor trying to slow things down.  The irony is that these chains think they are being more decentralized by polling people who potentially do not own coins and do not belong to the network.  There is nothing decentralized about that: it is merely an ineffective system.

Tezos wins hands-down with governance and nothing is more important to the decentralization of a chain.  If just a few devs are calling the shots rather than the network at large then you do not have an optimally decentralized network.  Maybe you did prior to Tezos creating its governance system but not anymore -- it is obsolete.

On the second aspect, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tezos all do quite well.  On these chains you need no permission to mine or bake and you need very little hardware to do so.  There are bakers on Tezos using a Raspberry Pi with people delegating millions of dollars of tez to them.  The amount of tez to be a baker on Tezos is not overly prohibitive, only 6k or about 9k USD.  On Ethereum is will be 32 Ether or about 32K USD, also not overly prohibitive. (Of course to be a competitive Bitcoin miner you need lots of expensive hardware but nothing prevents you from at least trying to use a smaller system -- and you need no permission to do so.)

On the third apsect Ethereum loses some marks: it is that when they transition to POS they have incentivized folks to split a stake making it impossible to stake with more than 32 ether.  So if you want to bake with 320 you will have to split it 10 times, which will make you look like 10 entities and make you look more decentralized on the third aspect.  But not really, we must take into account that this design is there and point it out.  Cardano does something similar.  Tezos does not play this game and so it is possible to get a more accurate account.

The other aspects are of little importance to the total score and will not be touched upon here except to say that Satoshi did a good job on the fourth aspect as he hasn't been heard from since Dec 2010.  He took the fourth aspect to the extreme.  (Vitalik has done a good job of pulling himself out of front man status.  On contentious issues within Ethereum he wont push his view very hard if at all.) Tezos does not really have this problem due to its governance system, so Arthur could be as loud as he wanted to be but stays rather quiet in any case.  And you can go through the other chains as well though this matters very little in the end due to aspect one and two taking up the bulk of it all.

Therefore, Tezos is likely the most decentralized chain so the most credibly neutral and the best settlement layer on the internet --which means of all cryptos that tez is the best store of value and that of all blockchains networks that Tezos will be the best for general computation (run your chain as a rollup on Tezos etc)

Post-script: I guess what I am getting at is that the most important aspects of decentralization are the design of the system.  Is the system itself decentralized?  Aspects 1 and 2 (and to some extent 3 -- the splitting part) are system designs.  The other aspects are not -- they are performance, a state of affairs, things subject to change.  Because you can have, for example, 10,000 devs working on your chain, with 5000 projects, and 20,000 nodes, but if your decision making is centralized and I need to ask someone's permission to join -- that is a centralized chain through and through -- despite its distribution of devs and projects.  It is not a robust censorship resistant chain that is a good store of value and a good place to create and store NFTs for intergenerational art.  Most likely it is a VC playground, a short term (in the grand scheme) pump, a flight of of fancy, and nothing serious for people to be considering for more than toy games that mean nothing and accrue no value. And yet that is not the position we find ourselves in!

We learned some things about the blockchain that we didn't know before and now we're looking at the ecosystem.

Tezos still lacks a lending protocol.  So is it fair to say that Tezos has defi at this point? The silver lining here is that is could very well explain why Tezos defi is routinely described as not nearly as good as the Tezos NFT ecosystem -- the explanation being: because Tezos defi does not really exist yet.

I know there are multiple teams trying to put together a lending platform.  I think on Ethereum much of the code for Lend/Aave and Compound was repurposed from Maker multi-collateral dai -- and creating multi-collateral dai was a huge (generally underappreciated) undertaking that involved a lot of time and massive brainpower.  Because Tezos is building everything from the ground up this may be just as tall an order.

I look forward to the day the first true lending platform is released (and is subsequently proven safe) because maybe then Tezos defi will take off (because it will actually exist!)","self","https://redd.it/w5fzy9"

We help to create an additional supply of liquidity for Tezos while allowing our users to earn extra yield in the meantime! Right now, we have launched the beta version of our protocol on mainnet and plan on moving forwards to the final release soon!

**What is our mission and what do we do exactly?**

We want to change the way liquidity baking works on Tezos for the better. And we plan to do it with the help of the Tezos community! Our protocol aims to allow liquidity bakers to access additional affordable liquidity by borrowing either tezos or BTC from their owners, who in return receive attractive APYs on the funds submitted to liquidity bakers. We call users who provide these assets Lenders and liquidity bakers who borrow them for extra leverage – Farmers. 

**Why Kord.Fi**

With our help, Farmers can tap into the relatively cheap leverage and earn up to 100% and above yields on liquidity provision while currently standard liquidity baking contract provides you only with 20-30% yields. Affordable leverage is magic!

For Lenders, our service is also great as they can earn around 10-15% yield on their xtz and/or BTC while bearing very little risk. Our built-in liquidation mechanism allows third-party users to promptly wind down liquidity baking Farms that are at risk of being unable to repay the collateral before the actual shortfall occurs. 

To recap, in our setup, we create a two-tier financial mechanism where you can choose how much risk you bear and either become a stable deposit yield earner (Lender) or a more exciting, yet riskier liquidity provision yield earner (Farmer).

We welcome your questions and will be happy to try answering all of them. Feel free to ask us all about Kord.Fi and subscribe to our updates ([http://kord.fi](http://kord.fi)) and follow us on twitter ([https://twitter.com/kord\_fi](https://twitter.com/kord_fi)) to learn first about the upcoming features!","self","https://redd.it/w60q02"

‘Choose your baker’ is specifically interesting for Corporate Bakers, which can now choose nodes on the blockchain that meet their compliance criteria so they can comply with regulations. 

‘Choose Your Baker’ is an open source software solution developed by the service company Coeyxa, with the technical support of Société General – Forge, Coinhouse, Ubisoft, and Nomadic Labs.

The launch of this project allows companies that are using the Tezos blockchain to ensure that their transactions will only be validated by nodes that meet their compliance criteria.

Is there a huge risk lurking that I don't know of?

Version 14.0 adds support for Kathmandu, the [protocol proposal](https://tzstats.com/election/head) currently going through the governance process, and which is a candidate to replace the economic protocol currently active on Tezos Mainnet. You can test it on the Kathmandunet test network, which is now included as a built-in network – i.e. it is known to the node and can be joined using `--network kathmandunet`.

Version 14.0 also prevents its client from originating new smart contracts containing [Timelock](https://tezos.gitlab.io/kathmandu/timelock.html) instructions. This is intended to discourage the use of Timelock, for which a vulnerability [was found in the current implementation](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/vulnerability-found-in-the-timelock-feature/4660). A fix addressing the latter vulnerability is in development, and more details will be provided in due time.

If you are updating from Octez version 13.0, note that version 14.0 changes the storage format. Run \`tezos-node upgrade storage\` to update your storage. This upgrade is instantaneous but the data directory can no longer be used with version 13.0 once upgraded.

Full changelog and update instructions are available in the version 14 release page: [http://tezos.gitlab.io/releases/version-14.html](http://tezos.gitlab.io/releases/version-14.html)

It's a must-read to summarize what's happening in the ecosystem. You'll read about network usage, governance, developer activity, key events & challenges, etc. All with diagrams for better understanding. Let's have a quick look at the key points

### Network Financials

 Q2 2022 was the worst quarter for crypto markets in the last decade, with the total crypto market cap decreasing by 58%. Tezos closed the quarter valued at $1.3 billion, down 60% ($2 billion) for the quarter. The drop puts it in line with the broader market. 

https://preview.redd.it/3l9u7cua1cf91.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=0836dfef822ac0235c7b35978fd63cbae6d3359c

### Network Usage

During Q2 2022, Tezos averaged 4.4 million smart contract calls (12% increase from Q3 2021) and 3.7 million transactions per month (12% decrease quarter over quarter). Transaction fees remain consistent, averaging less than $0.01 over the last year.

Overall, network usage has increased significantly year over year. In Q2 2021, Tezos averaged 1.9 million transactions per month, a 94% increase year over year.

### Accounts

 otal accounts have increased month over month for the last year; however, new accounts have dropped 9 of 10 months, peaking in September 2021 with 147,000 and bottoming in June 2022 with 32,000.

### NFT

 NFTs account for the majority of network activity. Through H1 2022, NFT marketplaces represent the top five applications by users. Objkt is the most popular with 545,000 users (40% share), followed by Hic et Nunc (370,000 or 27%), fxhash (261,000 or 19%), and Teia and Versum (roughly 90,000 or 7% each). Additionally, Tezos has [partnerships](https://tezos.com/stats/) with prominent brands including Manchester United, Oracle, Red Bull Racing, Mclaren Racing, Team Vitality, Gap, Papa Johns, Evian Water, Ubisoft, CCP Games, LVMH Guerlain, and more.

### Decentralization and Staking

 Through Q2 2022, Tezos maintained a high, consistent staking rate of 75–77% of total XTZ tokens staked. Of the XTZ staked, 80% (557 million XTZ) comes from delegators, with the remaining 20% (141 million XTZ) coming from validators. Tezos ended the quarter with a total supply of 922 million XTZ, a 1.1% quarterly inflation rate.

### Developer Activity

 Tezos was listed among the largest developer ecosystems according to the annual Electric Capital Developer Report. Through H1 2022, developer activity (which is measured by new smart contract deployments) is up 288% versus the same period in 2021. Activity has stabilized with an average of 7,335 new smart contract deployments per month.

### Governance

 Since May 2019, Tezos has undergone [10 protocol upgrades](https://wiki.tezos.com/learn/governance/past-tezos-amendments). During Q2 2022, the ninth upgrade Ithaca and tenth upgrade Jakarta were released. Nomadic Labs, alongside Marigold, TriliTech, Oxhead Alpha, Tarides, Dai Lambda, Functori, and Tweagio, announced the next protocol upgrade [Kathmandu](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/from-jakarta-to-kathmandu-non-stop.html). Kathmandu will introduce improved randomness for distribution of baking rights, event-logging for off-chain systems to react to smart contract execution, ongoing block validation tweaks to increase max transactions per second, and support for 'Ghostnet' testnet that upgrades with mainnet.

If you validate transactions and blocks for a specific blockchain, you “run a node” or in Tezos terms, you are a Baker. You can also run a Tezos node without baking.

With baking, it basically means that you run a program on a dedicated computer or other device like a Raspberry Pi, 24/7. For this, you earn cryptocurrency as a reward.

Many people often ask if it’s worth setting up a Baker.

You’ll earn block rewards and a percentage of the staking rewards of your delegators, but is it worth the extra trouble to set up and maintain a node?

https://preview.redd.it/8coiijf1pvh91.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=b57c49f2a122a31880a7af12287c010d8e442b2f

Let's see what Kathmandu is about and why it is important for the ecosystem 🧵 👇

The previous protocol proposal - Jakarta, has introduced the first Tezos Layer 2 solution: Transaction Optimistic Rollups, or TORUs. 

📜Optimistic rollups enable higher throughput by moving the computationally demanding validation of TXs away from the main chain to Layer2

**But wait. What's a rollup in a nutshell?**

A rollup is an entity on the main chain, with its own address, that compactly represents off-chain transaction execution and state updates. Assets can be deposited to the rollup and withdrawn by accounts, smart contracts, or other rollups

📌 Optimistic rollups on Tezos are currently implemented as part of the protocol directly, and not as smart contracts. This is often called enshrined rollups.

TORUs is a great scaling solution for the ecosystem which is the first step in paving the way for SMART CONTRACT optimistic rollups

Smart Contract Optimistic RollUps, aka SCORUs, is the next Layer 2 scalability solution

SCORUs provide a generic infrastructure to implement any computational device. They are not limited to Michelson SCs, but can be adapted to support environments like WebAssembly or EVM

This design allows continuously developing and deploying new supported Proof-producing Virtual Machine (PVMs), and thereby new execution environments, via protocol amendments. In  Kathmandu, it's planned to introduce a first PVM supporting WebAssembly (WASM) 

https://preview.redd.it/2vvaicmhqvh91.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c3dcb1f4df33d51b98f5d60e62bb29388439fe0

Okay, so the next proposal improves the scalability issue. But why it is even an issue? 

**Let's see what is scalability super briefly** 👇👇

The scalability issue with Blockchain emerges mostly when the number of nodes and transactions increases. This problem exists in major public blockchain systems like Tezos since each node must store and execute a computational activity to validate each transaction.

Scalability refers to a network’s capacity to sustain larger tx throughput and is a key criterion in blockchain networks. The increasing number of use cases and the adoption of blockchain technology cannot impair the performance of a completely scalable blockchain. 

As a result, scalability is critical for Blockchain’s future growth. If we want to see #Tezos ecosystem grow and get bigger, we have to scale. If we want to see even more builders on Tezos - scaling is essential. ⚙️

&#x200B;

Edit: Oh wow looks like its only .37% per year to borrow tzBTC at the moment ","self","https://redd.it/wqroex"

USDC is so big it may ultimately call the shots on Ethereum. And the gov may want USDC to censor at some point. Or take a certain position in a fork.

What can Tezos learn from this?

Is there some sort of general constitutional protection it could create using its on-chain governance?

Is there some way to prevent fiat backed stablecoins from getting too big on Tezos? censor to prevent censorship lol

Ethereum has been switching to proof of stake for eight years and in all that time, eight long years, it could not figure out LPOS was superior? thats a pretty big fu## up. 

This is not the only thing Tezos has gotten right years ahead of time. Tezos also never chased trying to shard the whole chain. Instead Tezos guessed zk-rollups were the way forward back in 2017, years before they existed. (but now are pushing much more towards optimistic) — Tezos also started working on getting Sapling into the protocol years ago and i suspect that was to get the sharding/data availability ball rolling. (i know sapling is for privacy but i think working with that type of stuff has carryover into cutting edge scaling) 

One which nobody still admits, one everyone just dismisses, is that Tezos on-chain gov is better than dev led fork governance. At some point, maybe years from now, people will come to that conclusion too. And there are other smaller things that Tezos does right, things that incrementally make the chain top in class. Things like a human readable VM and a focus on facilitating formal verification. Things like not embracing something like 1559 in Tezos so that service agreements w miners can be created to reduce surge pricing. And on and on. Most dont sees it tho, dont see the system superiority, bc most have some pet metric they are obsessed with and that they think tells a story. Well the real story is the integrated system not the popularity of a part of the system at a point in time. And bag bias and invented economic theories will in no way stop Tezos technical superiority and organic community building from propeling it to top in class in ways that most crypto folk cannot fathom atm. Tezos has the most vibrant art NFT space in crypto and according to dns.xyz “Tezos is by far the biggest music NFT chain” 

When Tezos hits 1 million decentralized tps in 2023 new use cases will be invented, network effects and liquidity will explode, and the years-ahead tech superiority of Tezos will be accepted as common sense

edit: Also its perfectly natural to think “Oh Tezos could not be better than Ethereum bc I see so many seemingly smart people on Twitter coming up with crazy Ethereum economic theories” or whatever. But remember that Ethereum is 100 times larger than Tezos by base market cap (and more than that with protocols) — so for every one Tezos tweet you see saying something positive about Tezos you should see over 100 positive Ethereum tweets. But almost none of that matters in any case. A seldom few of those people has any idea what they are talking about — they are riding a wave and creating theories in hindsight","self","https://redd.it/wvk075"

Quilt is a decentralized P2P chat service on Tezos, which also functions cross-chain where users own their messages.

One of the goals for Quilt is to take cross-chain NFT interactions, and even sales to the next level. This will enable both online socialization and transactions to combine into one platform.

Quilt have recently released their global chat that is chain agnostic between Polygon and Tezos. Users can test the version here.

Quilt is currently participating in the Encode x Tezos Accelerator with their BETA-ready product.

Why The Need For Quilt?

In traditional Web 2 style messaging and chat applications users do not fully own the content that they create, or don’t fully control how it is used. This can lead to privacy and data usage issues, where users can become exploited.

In this post we’ll be talking about Tezos block explorer & how to access it. Info in this post will be extremely helpful for people that mine or trade $XTZ, as well as for those who want to develop on Tezos.  
Any cryptocurrency’s blockchain consists of nodes — full-fledged network participants who validate transactions in it. To do so, they dispose of a fully downloaded copy of the blockchain database and refresh it 24/7. A block explorer is a piece of software that connects to this database, derives all the information, and presents it in a human-readable way.

A block explorer is the Google of a cryptocurrency — it allows you to see everything that is happening in its network. Thus, you can see any transaction’s status and its history, transacted amounts, wallet balances, block heights, lists of the richest wallets, sources and destination of funds, and much more. 

The main goal of creating Tezos was building a protocol that would be resistant to hard forks. In cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, splits happen in the network regarding the vision of updates that need to be implemented. This is followed by hard forks — the main chain is divided in two, and they start to act separately.   
One of the most frequently used Tezos block explorers is Tezblock. You can use Tezblock manually, as your $XTZ explorer for your personal needs. However, if you’re building a project like a wallet, an exchange, or an analytical platform on Tezos, you need constant access to databases in the XTZ explorer, and the data needs to be derived automatically.

With the new update, you can now see two new (and essential) metrics when opening a levered liquidity  Farm on Kord.Fi:

1. Your Net Position
2. Your distance to liquidation (expressed as a percentage change in tez/tzBTC exchange rate)

Let’s explain what we mean by these. Then net position essentially refers to what is the net risk of your position after accounting for leverage and the borrowed asset. So in the screenshot attached to this post, we can see that if you finance your Farm at 2x leverage by borrowing tez (left side) your net position can be seen as tzBTC one (since your Farm itself is equal parts tez and tzBTC and the debt is in tez so So the net position is just tzBTC).

If you chose the option on the right though and fund your 2x leveraged position with tzBTC   then your net position will be effectively 100% net long tezos! 

These calculations will be slightly different for the above 2x leverage as in these cases you start not only being net long one of the assets but also net short another the more you borrow it. For example when you borrow tez you at first become net long tzBTC at 2x leverage but as the leverage (and borrowed tez) amount go up you start adding net short tez exposure to your net long tzBTC position until it effectively becomes net long tzBTC/tez pair.

The distance to the liquidation percentage indicator (below the collateral ratio one) shows the percentage rate by which the tez/tzBTC exchange rate has to move for your Farm to get liquidated. As you can see for yourself from our screen this number is very big in either direction for the case of 2x leverage. Meanwhile, you can earn around 40% APYs even at this relatively safe level of leverage both by borrowing tez or tzBTC! All you need is to take your tez to a Farm at Kord.Fi, choose 2x leverage and the asset you wan to borrow. If you borrow tez your position will be tzBTC as mentioned above and vice versa. 

Interestingly enough, ever since liquidity baking has been introduced to tezos Blockchain (summer of 2021) the tez/BTC (and that means tez/tzBTC by design) has seen much smaller volatility than before and you would have had zero liquidation events if Farming at 2x leverage during the last year. Thus the Farming option described above would have been virtually risk-free, allowing you to generate up to 40% yields on your Tezos!

We're bringing land that's been destroyed back to life with the help of local communities and in a way that can massively scale. Here's a one minute summary of how it works:

We've just been selected for the Gitcoin GR15 Climate Tech funding round which starts today. For every person that funds the Angry Teenagers, we get more match funding - it is about the number of people, more than the absolute amount. Which is where we have a disadvantage: the Gitcoin community is largely based around ETH and ETH L2s.

We're actually the only Tezos project in the round - which is crazy because Tezos really should be the home of blockchain climate tech! We'd love to mobilize some of the wider Tezos community to support our grant, and also to spread the understanding that Tezos is the right chain for Climate Tech projects!

Even a donation of $1 is super important and can get amplified many times.

The grant opens today, and the earlier we get funds in, the more visibility we get, so time is of the essence! Here's the link: https://gitcoin.co/grants/7028/the-angry-teenagers

The Kathmandu protocol activates on Tezos Mainnet [on September 23rd!](https://www.tezosagora.org/period/80) Please, remember to update your infrastructure to Octez v14.0 before then.

The Octez baker daemon for Kathmandu, \`tezos-baker-014-PtKathma\`, requires a mandatory command line flag to set up the baker’s Liquidity Baking toggle vote:

\`--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote <vote>\`

It also provides an optional \`--votefile <file>\` flag intended to be used to declare the path for a JSON file encoding the baker's voting preference and which, if present, overrides the default value set by the earlier \`--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote\` flag.

More details in the [Liquidity Baking documentation](https://tezos.gitlab.io/kathmandu/liquidity_baking.html).

An overview of changes in Kathmandu:

* [Smart contract optimistic rollups](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/next-generation-rollups.html), the next generation of optimistic rollups for Tezos, begin their journey towards future integration in Tezos. At this stage, they are available at the bleeding edge [Mondaynet](https://teztnets.xyz/mondaynet-about) and [Dailynet](https://teztnets.xyz/dailynet-about) test networks to ensure the community has sufficient time to build integration, tooling and applications.
* [Pipelined validation](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/from-jakarta-to-kathmandu-non-stop.html#first-steps-towards-pipelined-block-validation) of manager operations.
* [Improved randomness](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/from-jakarta-to-kathmandu-non-stop.html#improved-randomness-using-verifiable-delay-functions) with integration of Verifiable Delay Functions.
* [Support for tailored governance](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/from-jakarta-to-kathmandu-non-stop.html#support-for-permanent-test-networks) for permanent testnets: no more user-activated upgrades will be required to upgrade [Ghostnet](https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet-about).
* [Event logging](https://www.marigold.dev/post/how-to-send-events-from-contract-fast) in Michelson smart contracts.
* A [new operation for increasing paid storage](https://tezos.gitlab.io/protocols/014_kathmandu.html#increase-paid-storage) of smart contracts.

Since the early days of Tezos DeFi liquidity pools, many new members have joined the scene. For those who have been around a while, you probably remember the wild liquidity swings of the early Quipuswap days.  It was, and still is, easy to lose track of LP positions across the numerous DEXs on Tezos. This feature solves that! No more wondering where all your Tezos LP is hiding!

We continue to build products that help you make the best of your DeFi adventures. We hope you enjoy this feature, as well as all of our current and future ones!

‘Confidential Computing ‘…is a cloud computing technology that isolates sensitive data in an encrypted CPU enclave during processing. The contents of the enclave — the data being processed, and the techniques that are used to process it — are accessible only to authorized programming code, and are invisible and unknowable to anything or anyone else, including the cloud provider.’

I was testing Bitcoin's Lightning Network and realized that the feature which the user could set how much he can receive and the payer just need to copy and paste the code, or check the QR Code, and the amount is set in the wallet - totally amazing. That is wonderful for payments and possible user wrong doing when he is setting the value for a transaction. 

Is it possible to bring this functionality to Tezos?

When the Layer 2 solutions come here, could we use that in wallets as well?

One question I had regarding covering future tax payments, ie converting from XTZ back to GBP at the point of receiving rewards - does anyone have any recommendations regarding which platform to go with?  e.g. I know coinbase has an institutional part (ive never used it), is it expensive, are there minimum requirements (im not a very big outfit) ? Anything better out there that people have used, geared more for the small/medium sized enterprises rather than large institutions?

Secondly, I know that staking rewards are taxed in the UK as income, and equivalently as corporation tax for a business.  I havent seen any mention of VAT so I presume there is no VAT charge for staking rewards?  

Finally, i understand that when crypto tokens are exchanged from one form to another, or change beneficial owner, then that is a capital gains tax event.  When baking, is there a change of beneficial owner when your bond is locked ie when you actually bake a block?

Here are some points on why it's important for the Tezos ecosystem 🧵

“We’re excited to be live on Tezos and to offer its growing and vibrant community access to the most liquid, stable, and trusted stablecoin in the digital token space,” said *Paolo Ardoino*, CTO at Tether.

The reason for the launch and this partnership was to increase its digital footprint in the digital payments and DeFi sectors.

**Tezos is a blockchain that provides institutional-grade security, is energy efficient, brings endlessly upgradable, and is powerfully scalable.**

https://preview.redd.it/5xddz4y1jzr91.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d0d6c45b89fc41dad4410023f27003ecf3c2a9a

Also, Tezos is an LPoS blockchain designed to undergo changes without the need for a hard fork. With the addition of USDT to the Tezos, all protocols developed on top of this layer-one blockchain would be able to use the stablecoin for *staking, yield farming, lending, and other things*. So, the main purpose for Tether to launch its stablecoin on Tezos was to unlock new DeFi products because Tezos is a pioneering upgradable Proof-of-Stake blockchain.

Tezos protocol also incorporates a self-amending governance system, which allows continuous improvements while preserving the integrity of this consensus. It is worth noting that this is a rare feature that eliminates hard forks troubles.

Partnership with USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, strengthens Tezos as a blockchain designed to evolve.

*On Tezos, Web3 can be a truly user-governed and user-centric movement, the way it was meant to be!*

🔍 Octez v15.0\~rc1 introduces  context pruning for the context part of the storage backend. Thanks to it, the size taken on disk is not proportional to the node's up-time.

📢 In Octez v15.0\~rc1, the names of executable binaries change:

\- the \`tezos-\` prefix becomes \`octez-\`

\- the protocol number is removed from protocol-specific executables.

Acurast, formerly known in the Tezos ecosystem as ubinetic oracles, allows developers on Tezos to integrate price feeds, verifiable randomness, or any other off-chain data or computation activity.

Acurast has reimagined the concept of bringing off-chain data and computation on-chain, creating a platform where developers can access real-world data within their applications through a streamlined marketplace with the advantages of trusted execution environments.

Tezos dApp developers define a Script that is part of an Acurast Job. This Script defines in code e.g., what API is being called for the price of an asset, if certificate pinning is being done, calculations relevant to the use case.

The Acurast Job and its associated Script is being run by Data Transmitter in the Acurast Trusted Execution Environment which yields not only the output of the Script but also makes it verifiable.

This enables developers to create applications on Tezos that were not possible before and opens completely new use cases.

I want to build a platform for people to allow exchanging data. This is some sort of messaging application but instead of text you echange structured data (ie jsons).   


There are several implementations in order to do that, the simplest would be an API with a database.   
I am exploring potential blockchain applications for this. Some of the benefit of using a blockchain based approach would be: 

\- Guarantee authenticity and origin of the data

\- Have a legal notion of original document 

\- Create some sort of economics around data creation and access  


I have two questions for you:

On a technical point of view, i am wondering wether just use smart contracts for this or create a side chain, or realize that blockchain is not the good way to do this. Given that, if successful, the whole data may reach the TB size. What is your opinion of this ?

First of all, let me say I am **not** part of Web3. I've kinda been watching from the side, not really buying into the percieved overhype and tribalism of crypto enthusaists, while also scorning the doomerism, panic and closed-mindedness of crypto opponents. However, I've long been interested by Tezos, which has always seemed like the best blockchain out there to me.

However, after reading about its past and the (now disproved… I think) accusations of fraud, I am concerned… and I have no idea why, since the chain seems to be working fine noe. I even feel concerned about the ownership, despite it seeming… relatively decentralized by crypto standards? Although I don't know what these percentages mean in practically.

Sorry for this string of consciousness, but I thought maybe this sub could help answer some of my questions.","self","https://redd.it/y8x47m"

Meet **Lima - 12th protocol upgrade proposal for Tezos.** 

[Everstake](https://everstake.one/tezos) actively researched this proposal, and as a result, we supported it 🦾

Our operation hash check [here](https://tzkt.io/oonGNb11JUFii4JRHEGUqQYBKHh7ThNVNQnzhUCmzX3EmmFGwVH). Now let's discover all features of Lima!

**First, it's an update on optimistic rollups.** Next-generation enshrined optimistic rollups not be part of the Lima protocol upgrade proposal, as more time needs to be spent on validation and so on. 

**More pipelining for a faster blockchain.** The Lima protocol proposal extends pipelined validation to all remaining classes of operations and to blocks themselves.  The upcoming step will be to extend pipelined validation to block production itself. 

**Consensus keys.**  Consensus keys allow bakers to designate a special key - separate from the baker address key - for signing blocks and consensus operations, such as (pre)endorsements.  It let bakers change their consensus key without changing the baker’s public address. 

**Improvements to Tickets.**  Team deprecating creation, storage, and transfer of zero-amount tickets. This removes a source of inconvenience and reduces the risk of bugs in smart contracts but introduces a breaking change in the TICKET instruction. 

**Ghostnet fixes.**  The VDF challenge’s difficulty on Ghostnet is now set to ¼ of Mainnet’s.  A ‘force reset’ of the voting period is scheduled for Ghostnet’s migration to Lima, should the proposal be adopted by the community. 

**Liquidity Baking sunset removed!**  The liquidity-baking sunset will be removed since the subsidy can now be shut off with the moving-average toggle introduced with the Jakarta upgrade. 

**Temporary Timelock deprecation.**  The Lima protocol proposal complements this measure by preventing the origination of new contracts using this functionality. This is achieved by temporarily deprecating the CHEST\_OPEN instruction in Michelson.  More info will be released soon!

As announced earlier this year, Plenty DeFi and Wrap Protocol will merge into a one-stop DeFi network: Plenty Network (currently on ghostnet and simultaneously undergoing an external audit). 

The current governance tokens from both Plenty DeFi and Wrap Protocol will merge into one governance token: PLY.

PLENTY and WRAP holders can exchange their tokens for PLY at a predefined ratio, see here for more details.  

Additionally, it will soon be possible to earn PLY by supplying liquidity in the new Plenty AMM (DEX) by staking LP tokens. 

Nothing new you’d say at first glance, but there’s more to PLY than meets the eye.

I’m Mark, I’m 25 years old and I’m from Virgina, USA. I own a cannabis seed bank that I have started over the last few months. I have been working on building a cannabis business, doing what I love most. 

Legalization is becoming more and more popular in the states. As this happens there are instances where you have a new open industry but there’s not really many trustworthy geneticists/cultivators most are all out from the west coast. 

If you know me, then you know growing and cannabis is something that is very important to me in my life. It’s always been there, whether it’s growing or smoking. 

With this I’m attempting to close that gap while also bringing 2 of the greatest communities together. Cannabis and Web3 to the Tezos blockchain.

Staking in Tezos is available with many wallets. It's very easy and safe. So, let's know How to stake Tezos XTZ using KukaiWallet 💥

*Firstly you need to create a wallet*. You may either sign in with your social account/create a regular web wallet, or connect your Ledger device.

Let's figure out a traditional way - to click Create New Wallet in the upper right corner.

*Save passphrase,* aka seed phrase. You have to keep it secure and carefully write it down in the correct order. Then, you have to verify your seed. After that, click Next.

[How to stake Tezos using Kukai Wallet: detailed guide by Everstake](https://preview.redd.it/vhrhv41sr4w91.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad2db87f8d02f0a0073dfc3e46379b83269f9fa6)

The DeFi space is a major aspect of web3 and it promises a lot of opportunities. Passive earning has become a no-brainer with DeFi as this is easily achievable through liquidity pools, farms, staking and more interesting DeFi use cases. I would like to share with the community a cool way of earning passive yield I discovered some months ago. Talking about YOU, it’s the governance token of the Youves platform and can be gotten through minting on Youves, or by participating in farms, or by exchange in either a CEX or DEX. The YOU token never had an ICO and initially could only be received through minting on Youves. The maximum supply is quite limited (4.68m tokens). This is a very small amount for a token and the YOU emission halves every 52 weeks. This makes the token scarce and as an economic principle, limited supply implies increased value of an asset. It took me some time to study this strategy before sharing it to enable me to do proper checks on how sustainable this approach is and if this is as safe as it seems.

Very well then this is how to go about it

STEPS

* Purchase the YOU token on Bittrex. YOU can be bought directly on Bittrex via the YOU/USDT trading pair. If you have other tokens already on Bittrex, they could be converted to USDT and in turn used to purchase the YOU token.
* Withdraw purchased YOU tokens to a YOU supporting wallet (usually a tezos based wallet such as AirGap, kukai or Temple).
* Connect your chosen wallet with Youves
* Interact with the Youves platform by locking available YOU tokens in your wallet in the YOU staking pool.

By doing this, you begin to receive YOU rewards, currently at \~25.89% APR .

YOU rewards allocated to the staking pools are driven mainly by the fees gotten from minting fees and swap fees.

[State of Tezos Q3 2022 report](https://preview.redd.it/a1t411chrqx91.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c944ef97f81e084425ac3fb93f703521fa188d49)

So, in this post, we'll take a look into:

* Financial Overview
* Tezos Accounts Activity
* Network activity
* Ecosystem and Developer Overview
* NFT marketplaces

**So, we will start with the Financial Overview.**

During Q3, Tezos recouped some of the losses with a 31% bear market rally. However, the rally was short-lived because of continued hawkish central bank rhetoric. Ultimately, Tezos ended the quarter near opening levels. 

[1](https://preview.redd.it/7jefl1rasqx91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=dea81f2cfb3f53e4055660fa77e65874ec9a5514)

Intramural metrics related to the XTZ token were consistent, while revenue-centric metrics were down substantially. During Q3, Tezos’s revenue was $191,000 (a 60% drop QoQ) with a circulating P/S ratio of 2,181x. A welcomed drop in transaction fees (58%) primarily drove the drop in revenue and a marginal drop in transaction volume (6%). 

[2](https://preview.redd.it/g30tbmwbsqx91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0be20358178a127f73c80ccebdb3c60a7cbe579)

**Next, let's see the Tezos Accounts Activity**

As the report states during Q3, overall accounts activity declined. Cleared accounts, defined as accounts that were emptied, decreased to the lowest level since the start of 2021. A decrease in cleared accounts is a net positive because it signals fewer people are leaving the network. 

[3](https://preview.redd.it/3kzscb2zsqx91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=993b68981e5bcdd69e69314dc31b4cb87bb43dfa)

**Despite the Bear Market we can see that Network activity has held up.** 

Through the 2022 bear market, Tezos has averaged 1.3 million transactions per month, a 25% increase over the 2021 bull market. 

[4](https://preview.redd.it/fz1hviactqx91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=29789b4eac2d14f8c98d8346433bade588cf63f0)

**Ecosystem and Developer Overview**

In Q3 activity largely decreased across the network. However, Messari Crypto find mixed outcomes when evaluating different sectors.

[5](https://preview.redd.it/hnfm02bltqx91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc55172b5b35219a44a05d50d15fd07de0ee0f9d)

**With active users in mind, NFT marketplaces continued to dominate.** 

During Q3, NFT marketplaces accounted for the top four applications by active users with approximately 11,000 unique weekly active users (representing 75% of active users across the network). Objkt is the dominant marketplace accounting for 40% of all active users. DeFi had the second largest presence with three applications, followed by gaming with two. Overall, active users declined across each of the three sectors during Q3.

[6](https://preview.redd.it/nvyrrtyotqx91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5465094c08f771296a7cb74945ccafc6261c2db0)

&#x200B;

It's been an incredible ride! We are together with Tezos since the fundraising ICO.

We were always commited to this amazing community and thrilled by the best blockchain technology ever.

&#x200B;

However, times have changed. Markets went down, costs went up and (especially for small bakers)

it's been tough to maintain things working with the high quality that Tezos community deserves.

&#x200B;

That is why, after 5 years of operation, and careful consideration of every other alternatives,

[Tezos.rio](https://Tezos.rio) has decided to cease baking operations.

&#x200B;

We are very grateful for our delegators and everyone who believed in our project.

Also, we will keep the software development division and continue deploying

solutions on Tezos blockchain.

&#x200B;

If you are one of our delegators, we kindly ask you to please proceed to changing your delegation

We are Boom, a Web-3 platform being incubated by Tezos in the APAC region.

Boom is a commerce-media platform where physical retail blends seamlessly with social media & blockchain technology into one comprehensive product experience. Focusing on the Tezos blockchain while also allowing cross chaining to address market requirements, we've been receiving steady mentorship from influential thought leaders in the Tezos APAC team as a part of the Tezos incubation program and we're tenacious & excited in building and progressing through these coming years.

A quick fun-fact about Boom is that NFTs are non-screenshottable & non-right-click-save-able which increases the true rarity factor of a digital piece of craft!

We are running a private Beta program for which we've received tremendous momentum and we would like to extend the invitation to the Tezos community members here as well.

The link to the signup can be accessed here:

Our main launch is estimated in Q1 2023.

   I have been part of the community since ICO. I have bought Tezos at $0.47 at the ICO, I have also bought it at $7. We all know we are in a bear market, many people including many bakers have thrown in the towel at this point and I understand that. The small bakers that are still here and validating the chain simply need to be recognized. This is why I am starting Tezos Bakers (.com) . I am not an expert in the field and I don’t have any educational accolades. I am a problem solver and I have seen a problem with too many small bakers leaving. To grow, Tezos has to have a strong sense of community that rallies around a common belief. We need strong committed bakers. Tezos is decentralized so it's up to all of us to ensure that it succeeds. Tezos is just as much yours/mine as it is AB’s and the foundation, that is what makes it so special.  

 So what can I do? I want to find the small bakers, project leaders and retail buyers and ask them WHY they still support Tezos. We can tell at this point, they are truly here not for the price action. They are here because  they believe that Tezos can solve real world problems. We have great explorers where you can look up individual bakers, but I would like to get to know more about the actual people on the other end of a public address. I would also like to help promote the smaller bakers so they get more delegators, we don’t want all the baking left to Binance and the Tezos Foundation. I also want to encourage others to start a bakery. I am looking for a bakery volunteer for a first zoom interview. We will keep security in mind so just a first name and face. I would ask simple questions about how you got started, how things are going etc? How can we improve as a community? Please just understand this is a grassroots movement and be willing to work with me. I will promote your bakery on the website Tezos Bakers and Youtube. We have to start somewhere, and see where it goes. 

   Finally please just keep in mind I am currently self funding this website and YT channel. I have reached out to the Tezos Foundation and have applied for a grant to help cover costs. I also recommended that the foundation do more smaller community based grants. Tezos won’t be built from the top down, it will be built by the people that use it. If we want to see change we all have to start by doing something small that either improves the network or creates growth, we can not wait on handouts and bailouts from the foundation. Please reach out and let's talk if your passion is Tezos, so would any baker like to set up a time to talk? Also shout out to ""Canadian Bakin"" he has some great YT videos and that's what we need more of, lots more.","self","https://redd.it/yrkl2d"

We have an array of promising projects like tezzardz, dogami, ottez, plenty, up, crunchy and a few others but one that I'm becoming increasingly bullish on is SalsaDAO.

sDAO is the DAO token that governs SpicySwap, MatterDeFi, and a few other dApps. It's been around since the start of Tezos DeFi but is becoming increasingly scarce and valuable. Here's my thinking in random order:

Supply and Burn - the token has a max supply of 57,500,000 and is being burned with various event on the sDao Gaming Hall - [https://salsadao.xyz/#/gaming/](https://salsadao.xyz/#/gaming/). So far hundreds of thousands of token are perma burned but I'd imagine that number goes up in the millions. There's also only 1.4m $sDAO in liquidity across DEXes which could cause a liquidity crunch for price if FOMO kicks in.

There's a growing treasury that has thousands of xtz in value that's fully owned and operated by the holders.

The dev/team behind the project is extremely big brained and have created a full-stack of dApps on Tezos. They're only increasing activity and a chain riddled with abandoned projects/teams that might be the most important aspect for longevity.

**But my biggest reason is this**: [https://spotlight.tezos.com/genius-contracts-announces-the-beta-version-of-the-nft-dex/](https://spotlight.tezos.com/genius-contracts-announces-the-beta-version-of-the-nft-dex/)

They're building a Sudoswap on Tezos. I played around with the Beta and this has potential to be huge. Once they get an audit and do main net launch an NFT focused chain like Tezos will eat this up.

And the best part - sDAO can be used to harvest platform fees

A decreasing supply DAO token that can farm fees of a high frequency NFT trading platform is unlike anything in all of crypto - not just Tezos.","self","https://redd.it/ystq9x"

But what seems simple, an uncensorable prediction market turns out to be quite complex. Building the prediction market is easy it is building the oracle that is difficult.

But at a minimum the prediction protocol needs to be built on a chain with 1) massive throughput and 2) real-deal decentralization.

Via Enshrined Rollups, Tezos may be the first to reach all that. Augur through years of research and dev has determined the game-theory. Augur can only live somewhere truly decentralized, which is why it still lives on Ethereum layer 1 (but its mostly unusable due to the fees and throughput)

Tezos has a chance to build such a killer app if 1) it gets to enshrined rollups first and 2) a hot-shot dev team decides to pursue such an endeavor.","self","https://redd.it/ytg0jh"

[Tezos'  leading NFT marketplace](https://preview.redd.it/d1894j8h7j0a1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5bf1132c9104f49da66b64c29568471a53b979a)

**Rarible is a multi-chain, community-centric NFT marketplace where anything is possible**, and all are welcome.

[Rarible](http://rarible.com) is an Ethereum-based platform that facilitates the creation, sale, and purchase of ownership rights to digital art via NFTs.

Currently, it supports NFT collections from these chains: Tezos, Ethereum, Solana, Immutable X, Flow, and Polygon.

This marketplace was founded in 2020 by Alex Salnikov and Alexei Falin.

It also has its own token - $RARI. It is the official token ticker of the Rarible Protocol token, the ERC-20 token used to govern both the Rarible Protocol and the Rari foundation.

Rarible is governed by a [DAO.](https://forum.rari.foundation/) Anyone who holds the Rarible's $RARI can vote on governance decisions for the protocol. Token holders can also submit new proposals for products and features that Rarible should add.

How to use Rarible?

It's super easy. Just follow these steps:

**Step 1**  \- You need to connect your wallet. For Tezos, it's 2 wallets - Beacon and Temple Wallet. You need to have some coins on your account to buy/mint NFTs.

[2](https://preview.redd.it/rwjhqwef8j0a1.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=452ca72b1c3d3c2ef322dfbb50f004cd148e537e)

**Step 2 -** Confirm entry from your wallet. Click sign.

**Step 3 -** Find an NFT to buy.  Once you’ve found an NFT you like, click on “Buy now” to make the purchase. Then, proceed with the payment.

[3](https://preview.redd.it/cu6r38yx8j0a1.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=acbccfc93d3d00da21323fd66d69a6c0cc5c72ab)

If you want a mint your NFT there, it's also easy:  You need to upload your art, fill out some basic information, decide on a sale price and pay the minting fee.

Checking SpicySwap, $sDAO currently has a reserve of 1,028,540 $sDAO. Since i started following this coin it's gone up 300% in value (assuming this is being driven by $sDAO staking for ArtDEX).

With only \~1 mil supply available on the free market... what happens? We're going to get to a point where this coin just isn't available on the free market. Demand isn't slowing down - do holders sell due to crazy price fluctuations? Genuinely interested to see how this game theory plays out.

Yupana is a decentralized lending platform. As a lender you can provide Tezos-based tokens as a loan to other users and earn interest on those tokens. As a borrower, you can provide Tezos-based tokens as collateral and take out a loan for any purpose. 

In other words, using Yupana, lenders provide liquidity and receive passive income, while borrowers take over collateralized loans. In turn, liquidators are incentivized to close insufficient collateral positions to keep the platform running.

Is there any way of figuring that out?

Reason I’m asking is because I started staking with The Staking Shop maybe 3-4 months ago and I could’ve sworn the fees were like 5.9% or something like that (I haven’t been monitoring it much).

I noticed a payment yesterday was way less than usual (I got somewhere around 3.5 XTZ when it’s usually 4.8-6.5 XTZ), so I actually looked at it on the explorer. I then noticed that the fees were 15%. 

I tried looking back at the past cycles but those all say 15% now. I’m just trying to figure out if I’m crazy or not because when I first started staking I definitely remember looking at bakers with lower fees and consistent payouts.

**Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies where the price is designed to be pegged to a reference asset. Tezos has also a few stablecoins that work on its blockchain. Let's check them!**

**The first is Tether USDT!** 

Now, Tezos is one of the blockchains on which USDT is available. Tezos is an LPoS blockchain designed to undergo changes without the need for a hard fork. With the addition of #USDT to the tezos, all protocols developed on top of this layer-one blockchain would be able to use the stablecoin for staking, yield farming, lending, and others.

**uUSD is a USD-pegged stable token** on the Youves exchange for synthetic assets by youves\_com

The uUSD is an algorithmic Stable Token pegged to the fiat USD. It is fungible by design and backed by tez collateral.  uUSD offers interest income in uUSD to its holders.

**Tezos USDS, USD-backed stablecoin**, on the Tezos public blockchain.

USDS is a stablecoin created by Stably\_Official, built upon the FA2 token standard, and issued by Prime Trust, a Nevada-chartered trust company that is also the regulated administrator for USDS.

**Kolibri is a Tezos-based stablecoin** built on Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) known as Ovens by HoverEng.

Kolibri uses CDPs (referred to as an Oven) to collateralize a soft pegged USD-stable value asset, kUSD. More details [here](https://kolibri.finance)

**LughStablecoin's  EURL** is the most reliable euro stablecoin. 

It's available on leading blockchains - Tezos, Polygon, and Ethereum. EURL is backed by fully reserved FIAT Euros on a Société Générale bank account. [Details:](https://www.lugh.io)

[Music NFTs and platforms on Tezos](https://preview.redd.it/e95hn7n1qo5a1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f4cd4a7fb963741e80309050c3c151836742b2)

Music NFT is a unique digital asset that has a musical component as well as a visual one 🎶

Usually, one music NFT contains only one song or fragment of a song. But it depends on the author. Plus, music NFTs can also be linked to things that are related to music (concert tickets or album covers).

In Tezos you have a wide choice of different music NFTs to own.

**RADION FM** is a platform for Tezos music NFTs. They convert conventional MP3s into Digital Assets with License, Copyright, and proper Jurisdiction.

Artists can create an NFT directly on the Radion platform with a very user-friendly interface.

To ensure that we don't face any issues like that in the future we decided to launch a new tzBTC contract for deposits and tzBTC-funded Farms. We advise everyone to migrate from the old one (that we plan to wind down sometime later) to the new, attack-proof contract, which we plan to launch next week. The sooner you do so the easier it will be for us to discontinue the old one and fully focus on the new one. Cheers and sorry for the trouble.

OCaml 5

OCaml is a general-purpose, high-level, statically-typed functional programming language with a heavy emphasis on safety, efficiency, and expressiveness. 

It has a strong type system, which helps to catch errors at compile-time rather than at runtime, this makes it easier to reason about the correctness of code.

The language is quite often used in industries such as finance, where one mistake in the code could prove catastrophic.

Jane Street, Docker, Facebook, Microsoft, Bloomberg, Ahrefs, and SimCorp are all known to use OCaml.

Despite the numerous advantages of OCaml, it did not have multicore support, and to this point it has limited Tezos to single-core performance.

Multicore OCaml has been in the making for 8 years as it required a full rewrite of the OCaml runtime environment.

It has also been highly anticipated in the developer community and there was even a community Twitter bot created to keep track of its progress towards this important milestone.

On December 16th and after 8 years of cutting-edge research and development from multiple teams, OCaml 5 multicore was released.

**They allow to program & deploy their own interoperable L2 solution in a number of popular programming languages, using a general-purpose infrastructure built.  But what is more?**  ⬇️

[Smart Rollups by Nomadic Lubs](https://preview.redd.it/gkyjx9jflh7a1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a6ab42049ee50958e8e213ebedf1ac7ab41dac7)

The key to the flexibility, decentralization, and security of these rollups is that they are implemented at the protocol level, making them a type of enshrined rollups.

🤓 - “enshrined” - “preserving something in a form that ensures it will be protected and respected”.

The benefits of enshrined rollups:

* It enables complex features that often impossible to implement using a smart contract-based rollup.
* Rollup-related L1 activity can be made much more computation/gas efficient.
* and much more!

Nomadic Labs implemented a general and flexible mechanism for providing arbitrary data to a rollup without going through Layer 1. It can be utilized in different ways. They expect to see 2 approaches:

* A Data Availability Committee (DAC)
* Data Availability Layer (DAL)

'DAC' is an off-chain mechanism to keep data available for verification, which relies on a trusted set of data providers.

'DAL' serves data like a DAC, but is a public good provided by the protocol itself: a dedicated rollup data layer for Tezos. So, it's more decentralized.

New reference manual for dapp developers. It covers ⬇️

* The generic optimistic rollup infrastructure developed for Tezos.
* The life-cycle of a WASM smart rollup.
* The software environment in which the smart rollup program is executed, including the API smart rollups can use.
* How Rust can be used to implement a simple smart rollup.
* How this simple smart rollup can be deployed on Tezos.

*Next Proposal Mumbai is featured by Smart Rollups activation.*

Smart rollups have been available on the Mondaynet testnet since the Lima proposal, but have undergone a number of significant improvements in their design and implementation during the development of Mumbai.

It  ensures the protection of users’ privacy but allows them to provide transparency where needed. 

Entities in the ecosystem have hesitated to deploy a Sapling contract due to the events around Tornado Cash.

However – we have taken the step of deploying a Sapling contract to transfer tez privately: 
https://tzkt.io/KT1KzAPQdpziH3bxxJXQNmNQA46oo8tnDQfj/code

We have acquired the domain SaplingShield.tez to make things easier for users. 

This contract is a copy of the one deployed by Airgap on Ghostnet. We do not make any guarantees for it – only that it is identical. 

We now call upon:
– AirGap to (re)integrate Sapling, allowing users to input this Sapling pool in order avoid endorsing a specific one. 
– other wallets to follow Airgap and eventually integrate Sapling
– block explorers to allow users to more meaningfully interact with Sapling transactions – e.g. input of viewing key. 

You can check recent discussions regarding  Sapling here: https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/sapling-support-adoption-in-tezos-ecosystem-current-state/4875

How do Tezos Bakers ensure redundancy among their devices?

I want to run a baker on one Linux server, and have another Linux server in my house take over if there’s a hardware failure.

I am worried about getting my rewards slashed if both devices are baking at the same time due to “double baking”. Is this a valid concern?

I’m pretty new to all this so if there is documentation for setting up redundancy with Tezos baking nodes, I’d be interested in reading it.

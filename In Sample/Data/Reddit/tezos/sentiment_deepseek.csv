Just like Ethereum was the first chain to implement smart contracts Tezos was the first chain to implement onchain governance proof of stake with slashing that is modern proof of stake a virtual machine that is human readable kinda tough to be putting billions into a smart contract you cannot 100 verify a chain that facilitates formal verification you can formally verify any chain but Tezos is built to make the process much easier because formal verification is notoriously difficult and time consuming Tezos was the second chain to successfully implement its own smart contract languages It was the second chain that Societe Generale did blockchain experiments with Ethereum was the first It was the second chain to successfully build an onchain dex from the ground up The second chain to build a decentralized stablecoin from the ground up Ethereum was obviously the first It was the first chain that built an onchain stablecoin that allowed to you continue staking while providing collateral It was the first chain to do the same with a dex and other aspects of defi It was the first chain to implement liquidity baking a dex built into the protocol itself so as to improve liquidity for the native asset It arguable has built the most advanced STO ecosystem with many firsts there And so on Now you might be thinking Ok first or second first or second who cares Well care speed is almost everything with technology First to market is very important as it often allows you to gather network effects A fast follower can sometimes get pretty good network effects too which is why second can be important Just look at say look at litecoin for example Second crypto ever created Well why isnt Tezos doing better with price I think because crypto is also this weird PT Barnum space and often saying you are doing or are going to do something is more important than the doing of it Or at least that was the case for years It allowed other chains that were say just hoping to one day years in the future to achieve what Tezos has achieved now to get many more followers than Tezos Crypto is also a space where copy pasting has done very well lately What gives me hope is that Tezos in building everything from the ground up and because it is first or second in so many things has shown time and again that it strives for and achieves excellence Tezos has a one two punch which is that a it innovates for example in things it is first in and b adopts what other chains are successfully using Innovation has to occur there too to be honest One example of b is that Tezos has been for years tirelessly changing the code of Tendermint to optimize it for Tezos calling it Tenderbake Another example of b Tezos spent much time writing in the privacy tech of Zcash into its code base In the future it will produce its own rollups and other scaling technology Tezos is also very decentralized and decentralization is the point of a blockchain that is how it achieves its store of value properties So the main reason I am hopeful about Tezos is that they have a history of excellence and I see no reason for that stopping in the future It is easy to get sidelined by other chains promising sugar plums and fairies and if enough people get snookered it actually become a self fulling prophecy at least over a small or medium timescale The organic growth and the organic part is key here because many other chains are literally spending hundreds of millions to inorganically say provide liquidity on Tezos is breathtaking Month over month exponential growth Tezos is building a platform filled with users who actually want to use the stuff and who are not here to just try to make a quick buck and then move on to the next chain And do you know where that really shows It shows in a place where you would least expect it It shows in the quality of the NFT art on Tezos I challenge you to find any other chain that has better quality NFT art except maybe Ethereum you are not going to find it Because the art on other chains is just copy paste Ethereum stuff But the artists in the Tezos NFT scene are highly talented I believe that is because the artists feel the organic energy that flows within Tezos You find it in everything from the wallets like Kukai which is the only browser based wallet in crypto were you can send crypto to someone with a gmail or twitter account try it it is amazing to the quirkiness of the NFT exchanges here like Hic Et Nunc And that is because so much sweat and tears and creativity goes into EVERYTHING built on Tezos It is not a copy paste fly by night operation it is the total opposite The legitimacy of Tezos is off the charts The other reason I think artists love Tezos so much is because of what I was talking about before store of value Due to the highly decentralized nature of Tezos you can run a node on a raspberry pi for example you can be more confident that Tezos will be around hundreds of years later which is important with art where pieces can be passed on within the family for generation after generation or traded and building value for hundreds or thousands of years Artists can achieve a slice of immortality with art But they cant achieve that if the platform fails them because it is centralized Also recently Vitalik Buterin pointed out the he was not hopeful about multichain crosschain stuff That is the stuff that is very in right now He did not like the security of it all Tezos has always been its own island its own nation largely avoiding that stuff He also recently noted that he thought interesting things were happening on Tezos and that it is a decentralized and honorable community I think he recognizes that it is a chain that is putting in the hard work and doing everything from the ground up and building its own organic ecosystem And I believe that is the best chance any chain has for building true network effects The price action on Tezos has been very subpar compared to other chains who have achieved so much less and have mostly promised sugar plums and fairies but the creativity and landmark accomplishments of the chain has been nothing short of breathtaking The madness of crowds cannot be predicted but I believe the excellence of Tezos will continue far into the future and that its network effects will continue to build month after month The artists of the world with their artistic sensibilities have been the first community to truly take note of the legitimacy of Tezos I believe other communities will follow

many reasons for a blockchain to attempt to maximize decentralization The main reason is so that your native currency is used as a store of value the other reasons will not be touched upon here There are also many reasons to pretend to maximize decentralization while taking shortcuts and using many centralized methods We see this all the time in crypto It is a form of marketing It works because decentralization is a sliding scale and there is no such thing as perfect decentralization Someone can always find a chink in the armor somewhere and so say See you are not perfectly decentralized and so it is okay that our chain does this centralized thing Also people define decentralization in different ways I think it makes the most sense to prioritize different aspects of a chain and their impact on decentralization The most important aspect due to the impact that it has on a chains state of affairs is the governance system Every chain has governance Our chain has no governance just means they have centralized governance and do not want to talk about it because pretending to be decentralized is good marketing The second aspect is whether it is pemissionless or permissioned to validate blocks and the economic reality of doing this such as the hardware required Believe it or not on some chains you need to get permission and say KYC to do this Solana is one example This is another massive centralized gateway that no amount of pay no attention to the man behind the curtain will do away with Also do you need at data center to validate blocks or at the decentralized extreme can you do it with a raspberry pi The third aspect is twofold a the number of validators in the network and b whether there are incentives for splitting validators Also is your chain beholden to a mulitsig could be inserted here as well This is more a performance metric than a design metric unless beholden to a multisig and so is not nearly as important as aspects one and two as it can always change and so in practice does a better job of measure the distribution of the network rather than its decentralization as a system think of it as snapshot in time This is also the most popular way of measuring decentralization we see thot leaders claiming aspect three as the beallendall all the time The fourth aspect in diminishing importance to centralization v decentralization is the front man risk Is one person calling all the shots Is he there are no females doing this directing the crowd to do his bidding There really is not a chain in existence without a front man Even in Bitcoin Satoshi still directs via his writings from beyond the grave or wherever he is tho I guess Satoshi could be a female The fifth aspect is twofold a number of completed projects nonfunctioning projects do not matter and b variety of projects such as financial artbased social etc The sixth aspect is the number of developers building on the chain This matters very little because it can always change depending on the popularity of the chain or speculative interests There are some other aspects you could probably drag up like tooling and how this promotes global building but each thing you drag up will be of diminishing importance If I had to guess I would say in order adding up to 100 percent that the first aspect counts for 50 percent the second aspect for 40 the third for 5 and the remainder for the final 5 percent So it is the first two or three aspects that make up the lions share of the difference but people will use the existence of other aspects to help muddy the water and say things like there is no way to perfectly measure decentralization and then use that fact to justify why their overly centralized chain is actually decentralized because it seemingly scores high on one aspect they would like to highlight So the elephant in the room is the first aspect People like the handwave this one away Also you have to remember that people have different skillsets and just because someone is gifted with coding and network design does not mean they have determined the optimal way to decentralize a global blockchain Also memes can infect blockchain architects too It is the case that the prevailing idea is that a chain that depends on coinvoting is not decentralized and that a chain that has nogovernance is decentralized which needless to say is the opposite of reality and will be recognized by blockchain thinkers as a duh no brainer thing someday But we have already pointed out it is impossible to have no governance If you have no governance then your chain has ossified but all chains are still capable of change so there must be a form of governance to direct these existing chains Ethereum and Bitcoin start out with decentralized governance anyone can suggest a change but they end with a glaring central point of failure core devs must decide what to push through They can claim not to decide which side of the fork people run and yes that is true but they can affect many things depending on what they decide not to push through And even on what they push through they are in some sense pushing a button so there is regulatory risk Bitcoin maintainers complain about this and other risks such as maintainer infiltration Also they are humans and the humans will change over time and there is always the chance of a rogue cabal taking over People talk about Bitcoin lasting for 100 years or more but can they be certain that those running it will have the best interest of the chain at heart for 100 years or more How can they be certain What checks and balances are in place Human nature is tricky This is a massive centralization risk to just allow this small group to have so much sway Of course at first everything will go swimmingly as everyone is on the same page but as time marches forward how can we be certain this will remain the case Things change These core devs on Bitcoin are not even paid And on Ethereum they are not paid much What if the Ethereum L2s the nonenshrined rollups become more important than the L1 How will that effect decision making Is there a system in place to prevent this or is the only thing preventing it the human and changing core devs What a small centralized group to be directing the affairs of billions maybe even trillions of dollars Shouldnt there be a system in place One with checks and balances Tezos has a good one it keeps governance decentralized and so keeps the chain decentralized Anyone can suggest a change but only the most popular suggestion makes it to the next round Multiple teams can work on the change They can bill the protocol itself for the work Everyone either votes or they can delegate their vote that is their choice and a quorum must be hit for it to go to the next round For it to be finalized a supermajority must agree to it This system is capable of polling the community at large The tez token serves as the proxy measuring all who belong to the network The entire network is pushing changes working as one hivemind Sometimes detractors will say things like But with coinvoting you dont count all the other groups who matter like the dapp builders and the users of the chain etc A better way to look at this is that with coinvoting you use the best measure that serves as a proxy for all groups in the network the native token If you start polling people who do not own tokens how can you recognize friend from foe It could be a competitor trying to slow things down The irony is that these chains think they are being more decentralized by polling people who potentially do not own coins and do not belong to the network There is nothing decentralized about that it is merely an ineffective system Tezos wins handsdown with governance and nothing is more important to the decentralization of a chain If just a few devs are calling the shots rather than the network at large then you do not have an optimally decentralized network Maybe you did prior to Tezos creating its governance system but not anymore it is obsolete On the second aspect Bitcoin Ethereum and Tezos all do quite well On these chains you need no permission to mine or bake and you need very little hardware to do so There are bakers on Tezos using a Raspberry Pi with people delegating millions of dollars of tez to them The amount of tez to be a baker on Tezos is not overly prohibitive only 6k or about 9k USD On Ethereum is will be 32 Ether or about 32K USD also not overly prohibitive Of course to be a competitive Bitcoin miner you need lots of expensive hardware but nothing prevents you from at least trying to use a smaller system and you need no permission to do so On the third apsect Ethereum loses some marks it is that when they transition to POS they have incentivized folks to split a stake making it impossible to stake with more than 32 ether So if you want to bake with 320 you will have to split it 10 times which will make you look like 10 entities and make you look more decentralized on the third aspect But not really we must take into account that this design is there and point it out Cardano does something similar Tezos does not play this game and so it is possible to get a more accurate account The other aspects are of little importance to the total score and will not be touched upon here except to say that Satoshi did a good job on the fourth aspect as he hasnt been heard from since Dec 2010 He took the fourth aspect to the extreme Vitalik has done a good job of pulling himself out of front man status On contentious issues within Ethereum he wont push his view very hard if at all Tezos does not really have this problem due to its governance system so Arthur could be as loud as he wanted to be but stays rather quiet in any case And you can go through the other chains as well though this matters very little in the end due to aspect one and two taking up the bulk of it all Therefore Tezos is likely the most decentralized chain so the most credibly neutral and the best settlement layer on the internet which means of all cryptos that tez is the best store of value and that of all blockchains networks that Tezos will be the best for general computation run your chain as a rollup on Tezos etc Postscript I guess what I am getting at is that the most important aspects of decentralization are the design of the system Is the system itself decentralized Aspects 1 and 2 and to some extent 3 the splitting part are system designs The other aspects are not they are performance a state of affairs things subject to change Because you can have for example 10000 devs working on your chain with 5000 projects and 20000 nodes but if your decision making is centralized and I need to ask someones permission to join that is a centralized chain through and through despite its distribution of devs and projects It is not a robust censorship resistant chain that is a good store of value and a good place to create and store NFTs for intergenerational art Most likely it is a VC playground a short term in the grand scheme pump a flight of of fancy and nothing serious for people to be considering for more than toy games that mean nothing and accrue no value And yet that is not the position we find ourselves in x200B

&#x200B;

There now are multiple airdrops on XRPL, we can't be a part of, because we cannot establish a Global ID connection for KYC. It is only available to XUMM wallet users through the app on their phones.

&#x200B;

I think this is not fair, because we like to keep our XRP stored on our HW and we shouldn't have to move our assets out of HW just to get some airdrop. What can we do? Well, for starters, there should be either a possibility to verify HWs with GlobalID, or trying to persuade ""party who makes an airdrop"" to avoid GlobalID/make a new way to make sure only 1 person gets 1 airdrop, not farmer bots.

&#x200B;

Please, take this to your heart, and spread the word around Reddit/Twitter/Discord channels so we, as a XRP holders, can stop the discrimination that is happening to us.","self","https://redd.it/s59gat"

So how important is the USA in the 2-5 year growth of the coin?

If Ripple lose this this case as we all know the SEC will worm it’s way out of this or Biden will get them out of this pickle they are in.

SEC win and the USA is heavily constraint from listing XRP and sales from the US will never recover.

However ripple seems to be doing amazing well outside of the US. So what do we think the future of XRP will be without the US .

Can it recover back to a new ATH with a loss to the SEC? with limited involvement and sales from the USA

Is Ripple valued fairly?","None",0.91,55,0,0,42,0,"In the Ripple's Series C Funding, the company was valued at $9.8 Billion. But back in that time, Ripple owned/controlled $13 billion worth of XRPs. In more details, Ripple owned 6 billion XRPs and controlled the escrow account holding 46 billion XRPs and the XRP price was $0.25 (so, 52 billion XRPs x $0.25 = $13 billion)  

As far as I know, in seed/venture series rounds, start-ups are usually valued much higher than its assets. So, I am wondering why Ripple was valued only at $9.8 in Series C and what I am missing. 

Even in the recent news, Ripple bought back its shares at the company valuation of $15 billion from the Series C round investor. Considering the current XRP price of $0.61, it is also much lower than the total value of XRPs owned/controlled by Ripple. 

I assume that the XRPs in the escrow account is not counted in the Series C funding round, but I am wondering if it is usual and it should be the same in case Ripple goes IPO. 

Thank you for any comment in advance.","self","https://redd.it/sfc4ob"

'At the end of 2021, GateHub began the process of migrating certain parts of its business operations from the UK to the European Union. As part of the migration, some of the services provided by GateHub will soon be provided by a business entity in Lithuania (to be named GateHub UAB) which is authorized to provide custodial wallet and exchange services to its customers. The services offered by GateHub UAB fall within Lithuania's anti-money laundering regime. This action was taken in the best interest of GateHub’s customers.

This email is to inform you that on March 1st, 2022, GateHub will migrate all custodial customer accounts (GateHub and GateHub Fifth gateways) to a new business entity, GateHub UAB, based in Lithuania.'

Not sure if this might be any cause for concern, but they state as well: 

**'GateHub** **UAB** is an overseas entity and does not operate under UK laws or regulations, and is not regulated or supervised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority.'

I’ve been doing my best to follow this whole case, but I’m getting lost in the details. I just want to check and see if I’m missing something. 

Last I checked: 

I know that some of the SEC’s “evidence” is being unsealed on February 17, and I’ve seen Jeremy Hogan’s “Legal Briefs” on YouTube, and I’ve been briefed on why the evidence (emails from Larson and Garlinghouse) isn’t actually problematic.

I also know that Ripple has responded to the SEC’s motion to strike the “fair notice defense.”

Is there an actual date on when Judge Torres will speak about Ripple’s response to the strike? Or about “fair notice” in general?

And for the love of God, is there any hard deadline for the SEC to finally give up the documents they’ve been ordered to submit?

I know this is all exhausting, but I appreciate being brought up to speed!","self","https://redd.it/ssdhq4"

A security is a tradable financial asset. The term commonly refers to any form of financial instrument, but its legal definition varies by jurisdiction. In some countries and languages people commonly use the term ""security"" to refer to any form of financial instrument, even though the underlying legal and regulatory regime may not have such a broad definition. In some jurisdictions the term specifically excludes financial instruments other than equities and fixed-income instruments. In some jurisdictions it includes some instruments that are close to equities and fixed income, e.g., equity warrants.

I am not aware that XRP holders earn any sort of income! So is it a security ? 
If XRP is a security then WTH is every single other coin? 
If anything, it’s the mining industry that needs regulation rather than the entities building an innovation that is faster, cheaper to operate, and use less energy than the current system!  It is a breakthrough for human civilization in cross-border transactions that unites the world again in a 1 world economy favoring the USD as the world reserve currency. This should be praised rather than be sued!

What Am saying is instead of going around the circle and get back to square 0. 

Get couple of dictionaries, give them to the judge, fetch the word security, or just tell the judge to google it. After that ask him with common sense and deductive reasoning—- does he think XRP is a security??? If no—&gt; perfect; then ask the judge to please drop the case as ripple is not a security. 
If regardless they still think it is a security—-&gt; okay no problem; give ripple a fine then. Register the company as a security, get the legal paperwork done, make a settlement and end this nonsense! 
Legal entities exist to establish law and order. So is it a security? No —&amp;gt; end the case. Yes—&amp;gt; make the settlement and end the case! 
Both ways just end the case!","self","https://redd.it/svigya"

There certainly is nothing in these memos that suggests that Ripple was being reckless or ignored any substantial risks.  In fact, the memos suggest the opposite - that Ripple was being careful.

The fact that Ripple had the foresight to seek legal advice from a prominent firm in 2012 – in the absence of clear case law and 5 years before the SEC even started talking about digital assets – should be applauded. 2/2

Given the power that Swift (and restricting Swift) can have over other countries, it seems to be a powerful tool for Governments to hold over someone's head, and take away as punishment. 

Could the SEC case against Ripple be connected to the US Govermnent not wanting Swift to go away?

Those that follow Attorney John E Deaton on Twitter religiously (like I do), have probably noticed that he posts compelling “exculpatory evidence” and a timeline of “undisputed facts,” especially in regards to CoinBase clearly asking the SEC for the “Green Light” before listing XRP. 

My odds of having Deaton personally answer my question is slim, but I’m hoping that maybe one of you would have some insight: How or when is this evidence or timeline ever presented to a judge? 

I get a bit frustrated when I see all of this “exculpatory evidence” on Twitter, when I want it to be on the Judge’s desk. 

I follow the lawsuit against Ripple and it’s CEOS, but Deaton represents the XRP Holders and I feel like it’s a separate part of the same beast. I’m wondering if these facts ever make their way into the lawsuit?

U.S. Exchange platforms should have relisted it, like yesterday, after all this and everything that happened until now.

Currently, there are only around 150 validators, compared to Bitcoin's >15,000 ([source](https://bitnodes.io/).) Some of these 150 validators are owned and ran by Ripple themselves. Although Ripple's protocol is, in essence, decentralized, the size of the network means that very few nodes call the shots on what gets to go into the ledger, and what stays out.

A possible reason for the small number of validators is the lack of incentive to run one. Currently the only reason that you may want to run a validator is to boost the infrastructure of the network. The majority of humans, who are motivated purely and blindly by money, will not see this as a reason practically donate a computer.

To decrease the centralization of the network, there must be a much greater incentive (monetary or otherwise) to run a validator. I believe that this would massively increase the number of nodes on the network.

Of course, with any incentive, people will find a way to exploit it, but there must be some way of rewarding validators, without damaging the network.

I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments.","self","https://redd.it/t7c7dm"

I woke up to news that the SEC v. LBRY case is scheduled to resolve in May (before Ripple’s case).

I’ve been so engrossed with Ripple’s case, that LBRY was only in my periphery view. 

Can someone please explain how LBRY’s case has been going, in comparison with Ripple’s case? I need a comprehensive side by side comparison.

 It is obvious that this ruling can set a precedent for Ripple’s case, and if LBRY wins, they’d snatch that title of being the first coin legally deemed not a security. 

But I don’t have any context about what their case is like compared to ours, and if they lost, if there’s still a chance we could win?","self","https://redd.it/tg3dis"

Are you going to take your money and run or are you here for the liquidity brought to the entire market that ripple can produce using xrp? I hope many of you realize the ripple truly does not need to exist for xrp to go parabolic. Remember, the coin was created for the purpose of liquidity! Regaurdless of if ripple runs it's odl with xrp it still carries the intrinsic value of it's speed and scalability. Take notice R3 bought billions from ripple for it's liquidity use case. This is a firm example of the technology and code written into the xrp token itself rather than needing ripple or the odl platform for its success. What I'm trying to point out is the token will be used and sought after regaurdless of what happens in this case. No matter the smoking gun, the switch still exist. Xrp is essentially on lease the companies/central banks at the moment. When ripple and the nodes feel an opertune moment arrives with the majority of financial institutions take part and benefit from odl a decision will be made to further benefit the users of odl. Instead of leasing the technology.......THEY WILL BUY IT.

I have been in crypto for 5 years and xrp was my first coin and been following xrp closely but also every other coin.

Have anyone else been thinking to swap 25% 50% or more for some other coin that is very likely to outperform XRP and then swap back? 

My concerns are that it might be a bit late for that now and that XRP will start perform considering most coins already gained alot. but still some coins that likely to outperform XRP.

but on the other hand it look like XRP will yet again fall out of this little bullrun :/ i do belieave xrp can reach 3-6dollars but in the nearterm i dont think so! this springrally it will most likely go to 1.3-1.4 dollars..

1. The US Fed will create its own blockchain. Onboard the central banks of willing countries 

2. US-CBDC will be the bridge currency. As it is done now.

3. The central banks of these countries in turn will give access to their domestic commercial/retail banks to this block chain when they need to do cross border transfer. 

4. Central banks around the world will trust a govt backed currency such as US-CBDC over a currency backed by nothing / noone. Once can expect individuals to trust such currency but not large banks or governments.

On 4/4/22 Tan C. Tran - CEO of Vemanti Group posted ""And yes we're working with Ripple""

Tan C Tran was visiting Miami the day of that post, coincidently that day was the start of the Miami Bitcoin Festival.

I've been following this company for some time now and with everything they've got going on leads me to believe Ripple has big plans with Vemanti.

Hear me out. These are some notable mentions about Vemanti Group that will make my next question make sense.

*SEC reporting

* Sector - Fintech, blockchain, crypto, banking, p2p lending 

* A NEObank now with the new PVcomBank partnership (Vietnam Public Joint Stock Commercial Bank) check 'Shareholders Relations' Morgan Stanley holds 6.7%

* Just filed papers to list on NASDAQ from OTCM

* you can check their white papers to their FDIC insured stablecoin (waiting SEC approval) written by Franklin Noll

Frank Noll history is pretty impressive. He's a historian consultant on money and finance, creator of the hybrid bank note, involved in crypto and much more. Also has a freaking level 5 US Government Public Trust Security clearance.

*Ripple is looking to be in a decent position for a favorable ruling pending 3 outstanding issues. I do not believe we will see a settlement. Lawsuit finished after summary judgment with a rough estimate of August to September.*

The SEC vs Ripple case is actually in an incredibly important status now, more important than any other time we have seen. This is due to 3 outstanding issues that have yet to be settled by the judges:

* The Hinman emails
* The Metz report (edit: has just been settled, Judge Netburn denied Ripple's motion to strike)
* The Estabrook notes (edit: has just been settled, Judge Netburn denied Ripple's motion to compel)

These 3 issues have prompted the SEC to take extraordinary measures in federal court, implementing a strategy that is almost guaranteed to annoy the judges presiding over this case. This demonstrates, in my perspective, the SEC's desperation at this stage of the lawsuit and how damaging each of these issues could potentially be. I want to examine these 3 issues in further detail.

###The Hinman Emails
The SEC vs Ripple case as a whole will be studied in law textbooks years from now, but even more importantly, the issue of The Hinman Emails will be examined in-depth. The SEC strategy here has been not only desperate, but chaotic.

In a reckless attempt to keep crypto as a whole in a realm of regulatory uncertainty, the SEC, in federal court, stated clearly and plainly that the Hinman speech was personal opinion and nothing more, despite widespread interpretation of it being official guidance (there are plenty of video recordings of SEC officials pointing to the speech as official guidance).

When this stance backfired in a massive way and Judge Netburn ruled that since the speech was personal opinion, the Deliberative Process Privilege (DPP) did not protect the emails, the SEC submitted one of the most desperate motions in this case to date: their motion for reconsideration.

This motion in itself attempted to obfuscate their actual position on the Hinman speech, but to add enough language saying it was somehow ""official guidance"" but also ""not official guidance"", *but* official enough to grant DPP to protect the emails from discovery. Fortunately, the judge rebuked this attempt, but we are still now pending further actions from the SEC to prevent these emails being handed over at all costs: a declaration that they will renew a different argument to protect these emails, and indications they will file an objection up to Judge Torres.

Jeremy Hogan has overall been a great reviewer of this case, but I have one issue: he missed the mark on his comments regarding Judge Netburn's rebuttal of the SEC's motion for reconsideration, citing that her allowance for the SEC to redact certain parts of the emails relating to their actual deliberations might suffice and settle the issue for the SEC.

The problem is this: there was *never* any chance for that to be the case. Why? Their motion for reconsideration was so reckless from a litigation strategy standpoint and will potentially harm even the outcome for them in *this* case (and potentially future cases), that it would be complete insanity for them to file it if their true issue was just the ability to redact some smaller parts of the emails.

Their motion for reconsideration clearly demonstrated that their concern is the content of the emails as a whole. And now that they've made an official filing in federal court stating that the speech was actually somehow related to SEC policy on cryptocurrencies, those emails will be even *more* damaging even if their original position in the case was that it was all personal opinion.

**My prediction for the emails:** The SEC will lose in their attempt to renew DPP or Attorney-Client Privilege arguments even if the judge initially allows them to proceed with filing them. They will use this attempt to further delay the case, as they don't believe they will win on this renewal. After losing the renewal attempt, they will then proceed to file an objection up to Judge Torres. She will stand by Judge Netburn's ruling. If forced to hand over the emails, the SEC will attempt to redact portions of the emails that are relevant and it will be up to Judge Netburn to perform a review of their proposed redactions and to stop them from getting away with those attempts to redact things beyond what she stated they could.

###The Metz Report
Expert reports are an incredibly important part of the litigation process in cases like this. So what's happening here? The SEC is attempting to circumvent the court schedule for expert report filings due to how weak Dr. Metz's original report was. Essentially, they used Dr. Metz's original report to try to demonstrate how Ripple was a primary and key driver of XRP price, and Ripple's own report exposed how weak this original report from the SEC was.

Trying to file a new report at this point in the case is another clear sign of desperation for the SEC. They waited until after all depositions (so they had extra information) and until after all other expert reports were filed so they could specifically tailor a new response to try to bolster their argument. 

It might seem that this issue is less important than the Hinman emails, but I would say it's fairly close in importance. These types of reports are used for the basis of defining facts and evidence, particularly in Summary Judgment, and if the judges allow this new report (falsely described as a ""supplemental report""), it will bolster the SEC's position and also draw out the case even further as Ripple would have to be allowed to also create a new report, which they were not anticipating having to do.

The SEC is rightfully worried about Ripple's original reports and undermining of their own expert, so this is a desperate attempt to fix their shortcomings. Their position heading into Summary Judgment will be much weaker if they are not allowed to officially file and keep this report.

**My prediction for the Metz report:** I believe Ripple has a strong position in their move to strike this supplemental report. Established case law is pretty clear on what constitutes (and more importantly, what does *not* constitute) a supplemental report. That case law states that supplemental reports are not opportunities for a party to attempt gamesmanship in bolstering original reports. Given that, I foresee Judge Netburn granting Ripple's motion to strike the supplemental Metz report. I would be surprised if she allows the report to stay, but if she does, I do predict she will order the SEC to cover Ripple's costs in having to create a new report.

*Edit: Judge Netburn has just released her ruling denying Ripple's motion to strike. This is unfortunate given that it seems case law is fairly clear here regarding what constitutes supplemental reports. She even goes so far to criticize the SEC for improper conduct, but has stopped short of striking the motion. She has however, as I predicted given this scenario, ordered the SEC to cover Ripple's cost. Further evidence that I do not believe we will see a settlement*

###The Estabrook Notes
These notes, in my opinion, may actually be one of the most important set of notes to date in this case. It comes as no surprise to me that the SEC attempted to hide these notes until the very last minute and is desperately trying to keep them from Ripple. 

Why are these notes potentially devastating for the SEC? Think about how it will look if the SEC has been stating Ripple knowingly sold unregistered securities, yet notes written by the SEC document a meeting between the CEO of Ripple and an SEC commissioner and contain language that clearly shows active discussion around the future of XRP. If the notes contained language that Garlinghouse was told that XRP is definitely a security, the SEC would have no problem handing over those notes. No, these notes contain something else. Assurances that the SEC will work with Ripple, that they understand the need for innovation, etc. They will show that the SEC was giving Ripple one message, while then later backtracking and bringing this lawsuit out of nowhere.

**My predictions for the Estabrook Notes:** Judge Netburn has *already* ruled that notes between the SEC and 3rd parties are not protected by the DPP. Garlinghouse has also clearly stated there is no Attorney-Client privilege to apply here on his side. As such, there is no reason for these notes to be withheld. Given her previous rulings, I would be surprised if Judge Netburn lets the SEC keep these notes hidden. I believe she will rule that they must be handed over.

*Edit: Judge Netburn has just denied Ripple's motion to compel. Her thoughts here: ""The SEC’s fact-gathering from third parties is not an inherently privileged activity, but having reviewed Estabrook’s notes, I find that they could reveal to Garlinghouse the SEC’s internal thought processes during his meeting with Commissioner Roisman. The privilege applies."" Essentially, Estabrook took the notes in such a way that obfuscates the actual meeting minutes, adding his thoughts and other items that would provide, in Judge Netburn's opinion, too much information to Ripple. Unfortunate, and I do believe the SEC is getting away here. Still, this furthers my opinion that we will not see a settlement with this case.*

##Final Thoughts
Despite how damaging these 3 issues are, I believe the SEC has almost lost all sense of reason in this case. With how things are going, if we were going to see a settlement we would have seen one by now. The SEC is frenzied in their desire to kill Ripple's business. We already know that Ripple will not settle if XRP is not granted regulatory clarity and deemed a non-security. This is unacceptable to the SEC. I truly believe they are willing to now compromise even their potential future enforcement capability to have a minuscule chance of this case ending in their favor.

We will *possibly* only see a settlement if all 3 of these issues discussed here are resolved and final in Ripple's favor. Still, I think that's unlikely. If the SEC succeeds in any one of these, we will see this case 100% end in Summary Judgment.

On the contrary, Ripple is in a decent position. I think if any *one* of these issues is resolved in Ripple's favor, it could provide the ammunition necessary to cement a win in Summary Judgment. That's how critical each of these issues are and why we're seeing them being fought over hard at this stage of the lawsuit.

I am cautiously optimistic. These next two weeks will be pivotal as we hopefully get rulings on the Metz report and the Estabrook notes. Those two rulings will really set the stage for how Ripple will fair heading into the final battle.","self","https://redd.it/u79gt4"

In a CNBC-hosted fireside discussion at the Paris Blockchain Week Summit last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said, ""Polarization isn't healthy in my opinion.""  ""I own bitcoin, ether, and a few other cryptocurrencies.   
I am an unequivocal faith that this sector is going to continue to develop.""   ""All boats have the ability to lift,"" Garlinghouse added.   Former Yahoo executive Garlinghouse compared today's crypto business to the dotcom period of the late 1990s and early 2000s.    
 ""Yahoo and eBay both have a chance to succeed... They're working on different issues ""he stated ""There are several use cases, audiences, and markets to consider. Many of those parallels, I believe, still exist today.""  There are now tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation on crypto platforms like Binance, Coinbase and Tycoon, worth a combined $2 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.  Some digital coins have attracted quite a dedicated following — not least bitcoin, whose hardcore advocates are often referred to as ""maximalists.""","self","https://redd.it/u8uxjx"

As Jeremy Hogan put it, this is the 'worst case scenario' and very unusual to be so slow: [https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1517610717800714242?s=20&t=RZVdR3A6gxCdPROG2SmNMA](https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1517610717800714242?s=20&t=RZVdR3A6gxCdPROG2SmNMA).

It will take months for the judge to make a decision once everything is submitted, meaning a ruling is unlikely until March 2023 at the earliest. Head Counsel of Ripple has publicly stated that it is so drawn out because of the SEC (of course), and that if they had not agreed to it ""the next iteration would have very likely been even longer.""

Will be glad if anyone can answer some of my questions.

I assume Ripple doesn't aim to make money off xrp, so just wondering whether there's any relationship between how well the company is doing and the price of xrp. Does the profitability of Ripple affect xrp? And will the stability or volatility of xrp affect Ripple's business?

I think Ripple is mainly providing financial services and solutions to companies and institutions. So anyone knows who are Ripple's main competitors, and how well do you think Ripple is doing in comparison with them?

Also also, do you think there are any possible circumstances where Ripple will abandon xrp and switch to other crypto currency to run its network? Will it ever make sense for them to do so?

However, there are some main differences between Ripple and XRP that you need to keep in mind. Ripple is a startup company based in San Francisco, which develops software that gets used by banks and can facilitate global payments.

RippleNet is a platform created in 2021 to offer a real-time gross settlement system, which enables secure and instant financial transactions.  
Ripple is a completely separate company from XRP. XRP is a cryptocurrency that functions on top of the XRP Ledger. Anyone is given the opportunity to become a validator, and the XRP Ledger can exist and carry on living even if Ripple, for whatever reason, might go away as a company at some point in time.

Because the court does not care much about optimistic XRP hodlers and others involved in crypto, who really seek a win for Ripple, to have the price skyrocket and hodlers could finally live in financial stability, after such uncertainty and unrest.

Last and most importantly why the SEC - Ripple case should be over already with a win For ? Because the Judge of this case is a human. And, the world should not have to handle that humans are being judges of any cases happening in the world.

The reality is: God is the ultimate judge, and no humans shall have this authority to judge. So, let cases and decisions not be settled by human judges, but by common sense on what is actually better for humanity, and that cases be settled by individuals who actually care about the benefits and consequences that would come out of the cases.","self","https://redd.it/vdx7d4"

The XRP cryptocurrency is a digital asset that is specifically built to facilitate digital payments and aims to be an alternative when it comes to processing transactions on an international level. Ripple is a company that’s separate from XRP, and today, we are going to take you on an in-depth look at everything you need to know about the connection between Ripple and XRP.

Ripple is a startup company based in San Francisco. Ripple was launched as a means of developing software that can be used by banks in order to facilitate quick and global financial transactions. Ripple is a completely different, independent, and separate company from XRP.

Ripple is separate from XRP. This means that XRP is not the Ripple token, but it is a token used within the Ripple ecosystem.

Then there’s RippleNet, which is a platform that was created in order to let banks and financial institutions access a real-time gross settlement system, which leads to secure, instantaneous financial transactions on a worldwide basis.

Ripple and RippleNet let their customers use the XRP cryptocurrency for sourcing liquidity with cross-border transactions. Ripple did not issue and does not oversee XRP, and XRP is just a part of the broader ecosystem found within XRP.

Key Points:

* XRP coin is the native cryptocurrency token used across the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a fast, secure, and energy-efficient decentralized blockchain network.
* The goal of XRP is to enable transactions on a global scale with low transaction costs, alongside providing developers with a strong, open-source foundation in regard to the execution of demanding projects.
* RippleNet is a platform developed in 2012 to offer banks and financial institutions a real-time gross settlement system that leads to instant transactions.
* Ripple is a completely independent and separate company from XRP and is a San Francisco startup that develops software that gets used by banks, which means that XRP exists even without Ripple.

"vicpp4","ripple","HappyGreetings",1655924644,1656025625,1655924880,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"BIS Report on the future monetary system, P27, and Ripples position","None",0.95,29,0,0,4,0,"Yesterday BIS released [chapter 3 from their Annual Economic Report 2022](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2022e3.htm); the full report will be released on the 26th of June 2022. The 41 page document leads with these takeaways:

* A burst of creative innovation is under  way in money and payments, opening up vistas of a future digital  monetary system that adapts continuously to serve the public interest.
* Structural flaws make the crypto universe  unsuitable as the basis for a monetary system: it lacks a stable  nominal anchor, while limits to its scalability result in fragmentation.  Contrary to the decentralisation narrative, crypto often relies on  unregulated intermediaries that pose financial risks.
* A system grounded in central bank money  offers a sounder basis for innovation, ensuring that services are stable  and interoperable, domestically and across borders. Such a system can  sustain a virtuous circle of trust and adaptability through network  effects.
* New capabilities such as programmability,  composability and tokenisation are not the preserve of crypto, but can  instead be built on top of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), fast  payment systems and associated data architectures.

The document should be of interest to anyone interested in what the financial world is actually working towards. Neither Ripple, nor XRP, have been mentioned in these reports in a major way the last couple of years. To me this is concering, or is at least not compatible with a belief that Ripples XRPL or its other solutions are involved in these larger projects, which they should be if this was indeed the best solution to many of these problems. The fact that we only have projects with really tiny nations is telling, let's not kid ourselves. Both this report and leading organisations are doing major work in these areas - but it is not cryptocurrency that interests them - it is the technology of DLT, smart contracts, and CBDCs, that is of interest - tellingly explained in above point two. The most referred to projects seem to be R3s Corda in the BIS Innovation Hub's Nexus project (highly recommend the [report](https://www.bis.org/publ/othp39.htm)\- just don't expect to find a lot of things pointing to Ripple explicitly, as there are none), and SWIFT's GPI, which seemingly leave some things unresolved. It should be noted that most central banks in their reports on these matters continually stress the importance of the private sector to fill many roles - among them cross border transfers, or many other roles aimed towards retail. This is where this last report gets interesting.

The chapter 3 part of the report now public, does hold a lot of good stuff. It speaks tons about the roles of retail PSPs (Payment Service Providers), and the different roles they would have - see especially the section called Vision for the future monetary system (p. 90-103). It does seem to me that Ripple is well suited to be able to fill this role - and can in fact already do so in many regards, even without the actualy CBDCs that is otherwise thought of as a necessary part.

It is also the case, that even though actual retail CBDCs are a couple of years away in the future, smaller more regional approaches are starting to create a space in which I can easily see Ripple and XRPL neatly fit into. [The second P27 white paper, released 8th of June 2022,](https://nordicpayments.eu/the-p27-white-paper-2022-the-payments-enabler-for-the-nordics/)talks volumes about the Nordic market and the inititives of the leading banks in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, are pushing towards. Parts of these innovations, which at least according to the reports are fairly imminent, also leave room for private inititives such as Ripple, to play a major role in delivering products to retail consumers. Indeed, Sweden and the Nordic countries already have come in this - we send money by phone in seconds, and not paying with our phones everywhere feels antiquated and even paying with cards is done seldomly among sub 40-year olds. In summation there seems to still be a small window in which to act or start operating, before the central banks release their own CBDCs, which judging by all government and banking-organisations project reports and white papers will not use Ripple or at least have not involved them in their larger projects (just go see for yourselves - I also ""know"" that many of us believe Ripple is already involved in them, which simply is not true - just read their reports).

The opportunity certainly is still here and is in many regards up for grabs; that CBDCs will not be released with Ripple as their main operator is not a threat in this. Ripple can however still be one of the first companies to take advantage on the soon to be realised new financial system, and there are parts to be filled for sure. Ripples solution is in many regards elegant, and should generally work quite well assuming they can establish themselves in especially the Nordic countries so to be able to trade their currencies with a sufficiently high liquidity - when we can see this start to happen, we will certainly have a good position in still hodling XRP.

How concerned are you that Ripple seems to be left out from the worlds main stages? Does it matter? Is the niche that Ripple aims to take part of open enough for them, even with them being left out for the last couple of years? Thoughts?

tl;drCentral banks and other organisations are not working directly with Ripple - but the vision they do have for the future monetary system does create a space which Ripple and XRP seems to be very well suited to fill. And much of this innovation is happening outside the US, which is good.","self","https://redd.it/vicpp4"

So **in Howey** you have this' **investment contract'** were you as an investor:

1. You pay a sum at once but get **nothing fysical** in return. (only 'maybe' a profit )
2. There is a **10 year commitment** for both parties.

3.) You are **completely dependend** from **solely** this **companies efforts** to maybe **to get a profit** every year. (Or a **third party** like **you** were obliged to contract another **second Howey company** that had the equipment and -personell and tractors and did all the efforts/ hard work on the land). (There was ""Howey the land owner company"" and ""Howey ""the service company"") You were obliged to contract them both. **There is this  ""the third party's efforts""**

4) You have **no rights at all to the land or fruits.**

&#x200B;

In XRP / crypto its complete different;

As an investor you **:**

**1.)  are getting something fysical in return**. A fysical coin that **already has value** (current value on the market) which you can **completely own** / store in your own wallet. .

2.) **You are not in a any obligation** to Ripple for 10 years. You can sell your coin /digital  asset/ product / item on any exchange anytime.

3) You are not depending from **solely Ripple's efforts for** profit if you buy a coin.

4. You have all the rights / powers over  your  item / product/ commodity.

**Expectation for profit.** You could swap the XRP coin\*\*/ sell the XRP coin for another coin (ETH) and make a profit in that coin rate deal with it\*\* (i.e. exact the same as official fiat currency trading). you can stake it /  lend it out to another person for rent / interest and **make profits by yourself on it completely without Ripple's efforts.**

**You can do that all yourself and you create that profit with it. Not Ripple.**

So her we are; it is a commodity you buy and own.

But a  new species one with extra and new aspects;

The **expectation for value rise (profits) besides currency trading etc. with it)** also **came from something else** than **solely 'ripple's business efforts** You cannot judge Ripple and the exectations of the investors without looking at the time and surroundings it (crypto) was created.

There was only BTC ETh XRP BCH digibyte etc. and people were hoping after the banking crises that these forms of digital coins on the internet **were to be used as digital money** like email on the internet like **a new form of internet money peer to peer.** This getting mass adoption was not in the hands of promotions of Vitalik and his team of developers, Roger Ver or Ripple or Jared Tate from digibyte etc.

Thats why its (also) a kind of commodity. like a stone you buy that gets more value by demand.

But there is more to it. With stocks you cannot do all of this which you can do with a crypto coin.

And the dream is that you can **also pay with these commodities** online. **Thats completely new. in the World. So it needs regulation. But by a new te be set up institution for commodities with a lot of extra specs.  Not the SEC not the CFTC maybe a new CFTC special institution**","self","https://redd.it/vjcjct"

I have a number of tokens from airdrops  / trading etc on the XRPL.  I currently use the XRPToolkit to manage this. 

This problem I am having is that its not easy to see the value on my token portfolio using that web site/portal.  On the toolkit you have to go to each token one by one and manipulate the trade tool to get a value. 

Is there a website I can use that shows token value in my wallet and will also maybe let me trade on the ledger ?

**Aug. 29, 2018**

“**I want to now share with** you the efforts the SEC has undertaken over the last sixteen months that are intended to foster capital formation, and **what you should expect from our upcoming regulatory agenda**, both with respect to public, registered offerings, and offerings exempt from registration—“private placements.” But before I do so, I want to say a few words about initial coin offerings (“ICOs”).

**Initial Coin Offerings**

No conversation about recent efforts at the SEC to foster innovation would be complete without mentioning **our approach** to distributed ledger technology, digital assets, and **ICOs**. Our efforts in these areas embody two key principles the SEC has followed for many decades—(1) embrace new technologies that cut costs and provide new investment opportunities while (2) continuing to require that our retail investors have access to the material information necessary to make an investment decision, including the key risks involved, as well as other fundamental protections.

**As I have said before,** those seeking to raise capital to fund an enterprise, which many in the ICO space have sought to do**, need to consider whether they are engaging in an offer or sale of securities,** which places the activity squarely in the SEC’s jurisdiction. **Determining what falls within the ambit of a securities** offer or sale is a facts-and-circumstances analysis, utilizing a principles-based framework that has served American companies and American investors well through periods of significant innovation and change for over 80 years. **Bill \[Hinman\] recently outlined the approach staff takes to evaluate whether a digital asset is a security**,[\[7\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-clayton-082918#_ftn7) **and I encourage you to take a look at Bill’s speech.**

If you are considering jumping into this space, I also encourage you to reach out to the staff in the Division of Corporation Finance. They have built significant expertise on these issues, and recently named a new Associate Director to serve as the Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation to coordinate efforts in this area across the agency.[\[8\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-clayton-082918#_ftn8) Our door remains open to those who seek to innovate and raise capital in accordance with the law.”","self","https://redd.it/vxzcr8"

The Hinman speech clearly lays the framework the SEC used to analyze whether a crypto project is a security or not. The emails likely show that the SEC told Hinman exactly what he said in the speech. 

https://cassels.com/insights/sec-declares-bitcoin-and-ether-as-non-securities/

The framework can be seen on the link above. The long list of questions are the most pertinent part. 

If the SEC’s appeal is denied, would Ripple risk losing the suit for the greater good of the whole crypto sector, by forcing the SEC to produce the documents?  (although Ripple would likely win)

Now, given there is a settlement, I question the immediate aftermath for one prominent reason: adoption. We know that a settlement will provide enough clarity to allow for exchanges to re-list XRP; that alone will likely move the price. However, I am thinking of a more ambitious timeline for the realization of the full potential of the XRPL.

My questions are:

What do you see as the key steps for widespread global adoption, and why? 

How fast do you see this occurring?

Do you believe there will be a global domino effect upon U.S. regulatory clarity? 

Have fun stewing on this!

&#x200B;

We all know Ripple will go to the moon, but when?

It appears XRP has been buying 1.7 B XRP tokens from the markets during Q2/2022.

Artithmetically, it means 560-570 M coins per month and daily it is 18-19 million XRP.

But, this is just average.

What I would be curious to know, is how this 1.7 B coins was distributed among the days of Q2. I would assume, the growth was accelerating towards the end of Q2?

Then we could probably make some extrapolation to calculate how their need for XRP is growing and how long it will take until the coins are out of exchanges completely (assuming the retail demand being 0). 

The second question (probably easy to answer or not?) is how many coins there are on exchanges currently (in order to get the clear picture on this one needs obviously to be aware of all the adresses the exchanges hold coins)?","self","https://redd.it/wdbt3x"

&#x200B;

There are rumours that Ripple has 2 different prices.

The price on the exchanges (right now around 0.40 usd/xrp) and some other (probably higher) price for their ODL partners.

From the perspective of ODL partner the price of XRP does not matter. They just want to move the value. That's all. For them, it is irrelevant wether the price is 1 usd or 10 000 usd. They just borrow the needed amount of XRP, do the transaction and get invoice later. 

&#x200B;

The concern of a newbie (me) is that they can run XRP private ledger ""forever"" for say 10k usd/xrp this year, when they grow they just hike the price to 100k usd/xrp etc.

The good thing about the higher price on private ledger is that there will be no selling to secondary markets because it does not make sense to sell a token that is worth 1k for 0.40 usd.

Also, the other advantage is that Ripple might benefit financially the arbitrage opportunity (buy for 0.40 usd from exchange, then sell it to ODL partners for 1000 usd). 

In order to be able to run 2 different prices the withdrawals of XRP could be allowed to the users, but not deposits of XRP because if they allow deposits, the users would buy tokens for 0.40 usd on exchange and use it on the private ledger with value of 1000 usd.

&#x200B;

Ripple has not denied not agreed if there is 2 different prices AFAIK.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts? Could this be possible? Pros and cons if this is the case?","self","https://redd.it/wdfgqi"

&#x200B;

While I think deflationary currencies are interesting in terms of investment it is not that clear cut.

I got a PM that suggested Ripple to burn their XRP tokens they hold in escrow.

I disagree this and probably would sell my XRP if they did so.

The simple argument is that if they burned their tokens, then what incentive would Ripple had to bring use cases for XRP?

I want my interest to be aligned with Ripple. One reason why bitcoin does not develop is that nobody has interest in doing so (in the beginning of bitcoin development it got charitable donations but in the long run this is not a sustainable method to develop anything). 

That being said, I am glad to see Ripple sucking coins from exchange and not spending their treasury just yet.","self","https://redd.it/we5e3q"

&#x200B;

There have been talks about Ripple being bought back by the governments/central banks in order to solve the debt issues.

How could it solve the debt issues?

If they are able to buy low a nice bag of XRP and then drive the price up. Then repay their debts with re-valued XRP.

I guess the governments need to do it in a co-ordinater manner in order to succeed.","self","https://redd.it/wfdu3z"

With each new transaction, ledgers are updated. If there is an error, the validators pause the entire chain. The network only resumes once everything has been verified. This gives XRP an edge over other cryptos such as Bitcoin (BTC)

XRP can be bought as a direct investment or used to trade with other tokens. The token can also finance network transactions on Ripple. Some other advantages include:

* **Fast transaction time**: Usually, transactions on Ripple happen within seconds as compared to the hours-long BTC transactions.
* **Low fees:** Transaction fees on the network ranges at 0.00001 XRP which is negligible.
* **Network versatility:** Ripple allows the token to be swapped for fiat currency. One way to leverage this to your benefit would be to exchange foreign currency for increased gain. For example, USD to XRP and then XRP to EURO. This would allow you to avoid the high fees on currency exchange.

The idea is that XRP, through Ripple’s network, can grow into a separate payment system, unrelated to anything in the current crypto market. That's what is drawing attention to it at the moment.Still, it’d be best to keep pace with all the developments happening in the crypto space.

### History

The basic concept of the Ripple protocol appeared a long time ago, several years before the Bitcoin launch. The first version of the system was launched in 2005. It was designed to organize secure online money transfers. 

At the beginning of 2011, 3 developers, David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto, got carried away with Bitcoin but noticed that mining involves high energy consumption. Their first observations about Bitcoin’s high energy consumption and scalability issues were accurate. In 2021, according to Ripple estimates, BTC mining will consume more energy resources than Argentina. 

In 2012, a trio of developers founded a company specializing in payment solutions — OpenCoin, which was rebranded to Ripple in 2015. In the same 2012 year, XRP Ledger (formerly known as Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL)), along with the new XRP cryptocurrency, was introduced to the still young crypto market. 

### What Is Ripple?

Ripple is a private company that provides a payment and exchange network (RippleNet) on top of a distributed XRP Ledger. The project's main goal is to form a chain of asset transfers, providing a cheaper, faster, transparent, and secure alternative to existing transaction methods, for example, SWIFT. The project functions as a global network for cheap and fast cross-border payments. Ripple is built on a system of gateways that serve hundreds of servers in different parts of the world. That is, the company uses distributed ledger technology, but its architecture is radically different from a typical blockchain.

### XRP Ledger

XRP Ledger is a public blockchain that hosts the native XRP currency. The task of XRP Ledger is to provide a swift and cost-effective exchange of assets between users without needing a central intermediary. The blockchain can process about 1500 TPS, with an average confirmation time of 3-5 seconds and a network fee of $0.0002. All this makes XRP a convenient tool for international peer-to-peer payments, remittances, and microtransactions. The architecture of Ripple is utterly different than in Bitcoin. Without going into technical details, we can briefly say that its network allows you to conduct transactions with any currencies and assets.

Initially, XRP Ledger was developed exclusively for payment use cases. Still, the project team has also focused on implementing new features such as NFTs, Federated Sidechains, and smart contract functionality. Therefore, XRP Ledger can be used by developers for executing various projects, for example:

* building of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges;
* issuing stablecoins, NFTs, and CBDCs;
* building various services where microtransaction support is needed (game projects, content monetization, and so on).

### XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol

XRP Ledger doesn’t utilize traditional Proof of Work or Proof of Stake consensus algorithms. All XRP coins have already been issued in the amount of 10 billion. However, less than half of the coins are in circulation, and the company keeps most of them at its escrows, gradually releasing them.

The designated servers (validators) are responsible for accepting and processing transactions. Any member of the network can become a validator, but this does not mean that he will take part in reaching a consensus. Each network participant has the right to choose which validators to trust independently. A set of reliable validators, called Unique Node Lists (UNLs), are published by Ripple, the XRP Ledger Foundation, and Coil. However, network participants have the right not to follow the recommendations of the listed publishers and choose trusted validators themselves.

A consensus scheme with validators provides a cheap, reliable, decentralized, and fast solution to the problem of double-spending. In addition, the XRP consensus protocol is environmentally sustainable since it consumes negligible energy.

At the time of writing, more than 150 validators are active, most of which are operated by universities, businesses, and exchanges. However, anyone can operate the validator, as it does not require any investments. A noticeable feature is that, unlike PoS or PoW networks, validators in XRP Ledger do not receive any financial incentive. The main benefit of running a validator is ensuring the network’s security and stability. Thus, businesses using XRP Ledger can run validators to ensure the reliability and stability of the platform.

### RippleNet 

RippleNet is a global payment system that enables participants to make payments and transfers in more than 40 currencies and serves more than 300 financial organizations worldwide. The platform provides three main solutions:

* **Cross-Border Payments**

This solution helps organizations reduce costs and speed up the cross-border payment flow. The solution is based on the “On-Demand Liquidity” system. The system uses XRP coins as a “connecting bridge” to exchange between fiat currencies. To put it simply, suppose that a USA-located sending institution sends $100 to its Turkish-located customer:

1. The dollar amount is converted into XRP.
2. XRP Ledger processes the transaction and charges a small network fee.
3. The receiving institution gets Turkish lira.

This dramatically reduces the fees for cross-border transfers inherent in traditional systems and increases the speed of the transaction. In addition, this is convenient for financial companies as they do not need to store money in different local currencies and worry about liquidity.

* **Crypto Liquidity**

Ripple Liquidity Hub will be built on Ripple’s existing infrastructure to integrate with multiple liquidity platforms, including exchanges, OTC desks, and market makers, allowing businesses to receive digital assets at optimized prices. This will enable Ripple partners to offer their customers the opportunity to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies at the most competitive prices. Initially, this product will only support BTC, ETH, LTC, ETC, BCH, and XRP, but the list will expand in the future.

* **Central Bank Digital Currency**

Ripple provides a platform for minting, managing, and destroying CBDCs. CBDC is digital money issued and backed by the Central Bank. CBDC has the official status of a means of payment and is regulated by the state. CBDCs are needed to make the entire banking system easier. Now only commercial banks work with Central Banks — they make settlements with each other through CB’s correspondent accounts (that’s why senders from different banks have to pay such hefty fees). CBDC also assumes that commercial banks (or their clients) can directly settle with each other, bypassing commercial banks and the Central Bank, just with CBDCs. Thanks to Ripple, banks get the opportunity to issue, distribute, and destroy CBDCs. Banks can send minted CBDCs directly to authorized accounts, and CBDCs holders can make almost instant transactions. At any moment, holders can redeem CBDCs for fiat, and banks can destroy CBDCs.

### Ripple VS SEC

At the end of 2020, the company had an unexpected problem. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation and later referred the case to the court. Representatives of the regulator insist that the nature of XRP assets refers to securities. The management of Ripple calls these claims “unjustified extortion” and confidently declares that according to American laws (the company is based in San Francisco), XRP is not a security. As of August 2022, the situation has not been finally resolved. It is not yet known what decisions the judges will make. However, if XRP is equated to securities, the project’s future will be questioned, and the company may suffer huge losses from fines.

### Closing Thoughts

Ripple is one of the most well-known companies in the crypto market. Since 2014, Ripple has been actively developing partnerships with banks and financial companies worldwide. During this time, hundreds of financial organizations have joined Ripple as partners, including Bank of America, NIUM, Azimo, MoneyMatch, Sentbe, and BitPay. However, Ripple has a chance to become popular not only among banks and individuals but also at the state level. The company is also working to ensure that its platform can support NFTs and smart contracts capabilities. This can significantly expand the scope of application and cause an increase in the price of coins.

The company's future largely depends on the outcome of the Ripple VS SEC lawsuit. Ripple has repeatedly stated that it has hundreds of potential customers waiting for the dispute to be resolved — they need a clear legal status of XRP to start using the company’s products. Suppose the court agrees with the SEC’s arguments. In that case, the company will face millions in fines, obligations to return over $1.3 billion received during the initial sales of XRP, and a ban on working with most financial companies.

Now lets do all some price predictions for the coming years for giggles, because why not?

To make it more interesting, try to give reasons why you think the price will be at a certain point. For example i think after the case, xrp will bounce up a little because of the media coverage, my guess to around 2 dollars.

Then it will stay at that price and follow the market trends untill the next bull run , i think late 2024 and reach 5 dollars. When other cryptos begin to slowly come down after the bull run , ISO20022 banks will start to implement xrp in 2025 and xrp will break loose from other cryptos and reach a steady 30 dollars with people trying to fomo in .

So what do you think??

Here's the exact reason why this is so.  

Ripple’s most valuable product isn’t its associated crypto token (XRP). It is the network itself. 

The original idea behind Ripple was to provide a secure payment avenue for an online community. XRP was developed later, almost as an afterthought. 

Today Ripple has managed to connect global financial institutions through RippleNet. Similar to a blockchain, RippleNet is a global network of banks and payment providers using the company's proprietary financial technology.

Some of the products in RippleNet include:

* **xCurrent:** Used for processing payments in real time
* **xVia:** Provides one standard interface for cross-network payments
* **xRapid:** Uses XRP to provide on-demand liquidity to banks and other financial institutions 

It’s easier to explain it this way: All banks become one functioning entity with RippleNet. From real-time messaging to immediate transaction settlement and cross-border payments, the network incorporates everything you can think of.

Simply put, Ripple orients itself toward financial organizations, not individuals. That’s why it’s becoming so popular and has the potential to be globally adopted before crypto does. 

The current bear market and the token’s intrinsic potential have fuelled a detailed [technical analysis of Ripple](https://blog.coindcx.com/crypto-technical-analysis/ripple-xrp-technical-analysis/). People have finally realized that the focus should be on the technology fueling the crypto space instead of surface-level token prices.

It all starts to make sense when you consider the eventual goal for blockchains. Everyone involved in the technology wants a decentralized financial network. Ripple is already halfway through that. 

The current hope is that the network establishes itself as an entirely separate payment system, unrelated to anything in crypto. If that happens, the world will begin reassessing what they think about crypto and blockchain technology.

&#x200B;

What are your guesses about the outcome of XRP law suit?

A lot of countries will be running on CBDC by eoy 2025. 

I assume XRP will have a major role in this, correct?

Likely, the law suit should have some sort of resolution by then.

When do you guys think it will get settled or solved?

I hope a settlement because if there will be a verdict, it can become pretty lengthy (and more costly).","self","https://redd.it/wv16z8"

Do I need to buy their XRP cryptocurrency in order to ""have stock"" in it? If so, which platform would you think is the best to do that(if I'm not able to invest in ripple)? I've heard of eToro, Uphold, Pionex, Bitstamp, Binance, Huobi Global,  Bitfinex, Bithumb, FTX

&#x200B;

I got inspired by the following YouTube influencer who made a video on burning XRP tokens.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZgmJK\_30gk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZgmJK_30gk)

&#x200B;

He showed in his video that 1 XRP is being burned per 100 000 transactions.

If XRP becomes world reserve currency, I wonder how many transactions are taking place per day?

It is possible XRP will become extremely scarce asset. But that requires of course the real world use of it. Hopefully billions of transactions per day.

There has been some speculation (again) on the settlement coming within a 1 month or so.

What do you guys think - John Deaton told somewhere it does not look like this but there is a possibility of political pressure being built so strong that SEC must settle.

Whale Alert is involved in the development of large on-chain cryptocurrency transactions, and Ripple (XRP) happens to be on the list of crypto assets tracked by Whale Alert.

This month alone, Whale Alert tracked the movement of a huge amount of XRP in the order of billions of dollars. Funds were sent from various crypto exchanges to unknown wallets, with Ripple directly involved in some of the transactions.

Hi

I was just looking through my events on my XUMM wallet and noticed some small XRP and SOLO deposits. Like .0000005 XRP and .0001 SOLO.

They are flagged as Fraud alert, I haven't responded or sent anything back to the address, do I need to do anything else to keep my wallet secure.","self","https://redd.it/x7osfu"

&#x200B;

Do you think the settlement will trigger a bull run of entire crypto market (for XRP definitely it is a bullish news which has not been priced in even).

But I am not talking XRP alone but the entire crypto market. Why I think it is a possibility?

Because there is a lot of ""freedom lovers"" in bitcoin community that just have bought XRP in order to increase their btc holdings. When those XRP tokens will be redeemed from those hands, bitcoins must have been bought prior to it. That could push the price of btc up and turn the entire market upside down and we might be approaching a full blown bull market just like that.","self","https://redd.it/xi7b7y"

I made this 5 years ago, one of the reasons is to distinguish Ripple and XRP. I didn't even put the Ripple logo on the coins. I might make a new one when the case is over, what should I put on the coins? Any ideas?

Idk much about hardware wallets, but I just want to put all my xrp on one and keep it in a safe offline essentially. I'm not really a trader. I plan on learning more about my specific wallet and wallets in general once I buy one and can tinker with it.

Does anyone have any good recommendations of which to get? I see from a twitter post a while ago that keepkey should support xrp, but idk if that's true anymore what with the legal stuff. I like the price on it though. The same goes for blockstream jade, although I can't tell if it supports anything other than bitcoin.

I'm also concerned about support for some wallets, can they be like obsoleted? Is there any chance I could get a wallet and have my xrp stuck in it with no ability to swap to another due to a service going down?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","self","https://redd.it/xpzt4s"

Ripple is building on a nascent technology as it introduces scalability that could only have been dreamed of a decade ago with the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

Due to its robustness, XRPL is enjoying massive adoption from several firms in the crypto space and beyond. Recent data highlights this growing adoption, as XRPL appears to have processed more than 75 million blocks at press time.

A look at the XRPL statistics on the XRPL Services platform reveals some impressive ledger data. The ledger index listing the most recent blockchain block shows an index of 75,013,727. This means that the ledger has cumulatively processed more than 75 million blocks – an impressive feat.

XRPL is home to more than 4.3 million accounts or wallet addresses. This data corroborates information from leading crypto intelligence product provider Messari. There are 4,336,389 wallet addresses on XRPL at press time.

Out of more than 4.3 million accounts, about 473 thousand have XRP balances worth at least $1,000, with more than 10,000 accounts having at least $100,000 worth of XRP. In addition, whale accounts with balances above $10 million number at the time of writing 325 - which is 0.007% of the total number of 4.3 million addresses.

Despite seemingly constant litigation with the SEC, XRP is on a steady growth path. The recent Crypto Winter also did not check its expansion much.","self","https://redd.it/y497kr"

I love this community, but now, I need to know that I’ve been following a cohort of sane people, who believe in XRP, without absolutely going looney tunes. 

Recently I’ve been feeling like everyone is so jacked up on Hopium that I’m doubting what I believe to be true, which is that I hold something valuable. Does that make sense? 
A lot of you guys look crazy, and it makes me feel crazy for holding so much XRP.

Can anyone here just offer reasonable reassurance without promising the world?

These are very large and important docs, and the hundreds of exhibits involved are 'under seal' until December/January. Initial responses online seem to be that the SEC's arguments are again very weak.

Each side gets to respond to these oppositions by 15th November, with public versions made available by 21st November.

John Deaton also said that he was waiting to see these two opposition docs before finalising and submitting his amicus brief, so that could also on the cards soon.","self","https://redd.it/ya79ce"

&#x200B;

The news story has been that SEC will not give up Hinman files - they rather settle than give up them.

Now out of woods they have actually given those. So those emails were not that bad from the perspective of SEC after all... Did Ripple legal team waste a lot of time for vain to get those files?

So, this goes now to judgement...? XRP as layer 1 chain is not a security, that is something even SEC knows. If there will be tokens on other layers, then those tokens MIGHT be security if they satisfy the definition of a security (it is likely there will be such tokens as we can expect the stock markets are moving into block chain and they will be other layers XRP being the native layer). 

&#x200B;

I suggest for Ripple to expose completely SEC if they will not settle SOON (should be some sort of dead line). That is something they owe us. Either settle or be exposed (I can take the settlement). No more waiting for months and months.","self","https://redd.it/yaibi7"

However, those XRP-oriented products ended the week with a positive inflow of $800,000. Month-to-month inflows to XRP amounted to $700,000 and year-to-year to $9.5 million.   


As the source notes, while inflows to XRP are relatively small, they are nevertheless the largest since the litigation between the SEC and XRP began. With recent developments, the rise in XRP inflows is unsurprising. CoinShares has been reporting outflows or neutrals from XRP over the past few weeks, but it was the last week that marked the imminent light at the end of the litigation tunnel. We could see that despite pressure from governments finance platforms like Ovenue, DigiFt, and some other projects like Ripple gaining momentum.   


In addition to XRP, inflows were seen in Bitcoin and Solana-oriented products. Moreover, the $4.6 million inflow in Bitcoin came on the back of a massive $7.1 million outflow from Short Bitcoin products. All told, $5 million has flowed out of crypto-oriented products in the past week, with analysts proclaiming the continuation of investors' apathy.","self","https://redd.it/ycnai1"

As we know, Elon Musk has a history with the SEC. The securities regulator attacked him in the past for his tweets. Besides, it’s also looking at Musk’s recent Twitter deal. Elon Musk’s legal team called the SEC action a “government-imposed muzzle”.

Some lawyers from the crypto space believe that the SEC could be throwing fresh tantrums over the Hinman speech. Web3 lawyer, Jesse Hyness wrote: “If the Hinman emails are as bad as we’re hearing, I wouldn’t be surprised for the SEC’s next step to throw Hinman under the bus, claim he was acting rogue, and that despite his actions, it doesn’t change the status of XRP”.","nsfw","https://redd.it/yeg6kx"

Unsurprisingly, the move has sparked speculation among the XRP faithful that the exchange is looking to relist XRP.  


As per Coinbase’s amicus brief request, along with other US-based crypto exchanges, it was forced to cease trading activities for the token following the SEC’s legal action against Ripple in December 2020. As Coinbase highlights in its brief, the case led to a domino effect that wiped off about $15 billion from XRP’s market cap, a loss felt mainly by XRP holders.  


Crypto has been in trouble and XRP along with finance and Gamefi ( led by projects like CosmoGene, Axie, and newcomers like LifeBeyond) are the ones making the push.  


It is worth noting that recent statements from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong renewed calls for the exchange to relist the token. The Coinbase chief had said that he was opposed to the tribalism in the crypto space in a video clip that made the rounds on Twitter, instead asserting that he was supportive of every decentralized project trying to facilitate global financial inclusion. However, as reported, the statements were not well received by the XRP community and Ripple chief Brad Garlinghouse who felt that the exchange had shown little support for XRP.  


Whether this will come to fruition remains to be seen.","self","https://redd.it/yk13y9"

I think the 76 year-old Howey Test doesn't seem quite helpful when applied to cryptocurrencies like XRP.

Quite likely because **each XRP is indistinguishable to another XRP**.

The problem becomes more apparent when we try to determine just exactly when XRPs can become 'securities' according to SEC's argument.

.

- I think it's quite obvious that when XRP was first created, it's not a security. There were no XRP sales made yet. 

- And so there are no investors with ""*an investment of money in common enterprise*"" (first and second prong of Howey Test), and no ""*expectation of profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party*"" (third prong of Howey Test).

- When then is the moment that XRP turns into a 'security' according to the SEC?

- Is it the moment when Ripple started its promotion of XRP and XRP ledger to potential investors?

- Does this promotion then suddenly convert all XRP en masse into securities, including those that Ripple does not own? Or is it the specific arrangement (the investment contract) sold by Ripple to the Purchaser that is the security? 

- What exactly is the security?

- It is like if I've managed to somehow own 80% of the diamonds in the world. When I start making efforts to promote diamonds to potential buyers, do all diamonds suddenly become securities? Including those not owned by me (such that should these other owners sell their diamonds, they are selling securities)?

- How exactly does my representation of diamonds (as profitable through my marketing effort) cause all diamonds to become securities? Is it the specific arrangement (investment contract), or is it the asset that is actually the security?

.

Maybe those who are better acquainted with the law can enlighten me on what exactly is a security.

And how can the promotion of an asset owned by me turn all identical assets not owned by me into securities too?","self","https://redd.it/ypari9"

Even a Loss Might not be a Loss...","None",0.85,17,0,0,7,0,"While everyone is throwing in the towel for a “total loss” of LBRY to the SEC this week (even John Deaton called it a [“total win for the SEC”](https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1589664273189388290)), the facts should be highlighted, and the FUD should be eliminated. 

Did LBRY lose its case to the SEC? It depends on how you look at it, and the real answer may just be – *not necessarily*. Of course, the SEC can put out their [press release](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2022/lr25573.htm) as having been victorious, and the judge in fact did find in the SEC’s favor, but the actual result may be more nuanced (even they point out at the bottom of their release that: “…The Court found that LBRY violated the charged provisions and **reserved the determination of relief for a later date**.” (bolding is mine) But, what is a judgement without relief; ergo, a final consequence? It’s still: wait and see…

In order to truthfully assess whether LBRY “lost”, and lost in the sense of the word that the judge declared LBRY a security going forward, read the judgement (dropbox link below). And, remember, Jeremy Kauffman had previously [told John Deaton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRkSIgqxr-w&t=936s) that he didn’t care if he had to admit that previous sales of LBC were structured as a security, as long as sales in the future were not deemed to be so, and LBC didn’t have to be registered. **The judge punted on what LBC is going forward**. Yes, he did declare LBC sales as sales of a security; however, the sales he ruled on were past sales, not present or future sales. 

“LBRY argues in the alternative that it should not be required to register future offerings of LBC even if its prior offerings were subject to Section 5’s registration requirement. **I decline to address this argument on the present record** because LBRY has not explained why possible future offerings of LBC should be treated differently from the company’s past offerings.” (bolding is mine) ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/f6tv8nh78s3gfqk/LBRY%20Ruling%20on%20Motion%20for%20Summary%20Judgment.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f6tv8nh78s3gfqk/LBRY%20Ruling%20on%20Motion%20for%20Summary%20Judgment.pdf?dl=0)) *So, I would argue, one of the most important parts of the whole case was not even addressed, i.e. whether or not LBC is a security henceforth*. But, it needs to be addressed… or, at least swept under the rug as it were, but LBC freed from its shackles.

What does it matter if past sales of LBC were sales of a security, as long as the fine is not prohibitive of LBRY moving forward with the LBC use case, and the future sales of LBC are not restricted, or labeled as a security? I cannot say that it will happen for sure; however, in the Kik case, even though [the SEC sought a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus interest, and a penalty](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-87) (as in the LBRY case), the ultimate result was the following:

“The final judgment permanently enjoins Kik from violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. Kik is further required, for the next three years, to provide notice to the Commission before engaging in enumerated future issuances, offers, sales, and transfers of digital assets. Kik will also pay a $5 million penalty.” ([https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-262](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-262)).

Between the judgement, and the ensuing status conference (or perhaps *at* the status conference?), **relief** will need to be determined for the SEC in the LBRY case. “The Clerk shall schedule a status conference to discuss the process for resolving any remaining issues.” This should be when the consequence is determined. In the Kik case, it was about 3 weeks after the judgement was submitted (September 30, 2020 was when judgement occurred, and October 21st was when the determination of relief was published). 

Kik itself realized that after their judgement from Judge Alvin Hellerstein, they were still in limbo, which is **exactly where LBRY is right now**, though Mr. Kauffman does not seem to realize it ([Jeremy Kauffman tweet](https://twitter.com/LBRYcom/status/1589645453091827712): “Sorry everyone. We lost.”). Kik put out a press release, expressing as much on the day of their court ruling in favor of the SEC: ""…The ruling may raise more questions than it answers, since it **applies only to our original token distribution**..."" and ""...**No relief was specified in the ruling**, but the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, civil penalties and disgorgement."" (bolding is mine; [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/kik-responds-to-court-ruling-in-favor-of-sec-845204867.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/kik-responds-to-court-ruling-in-favor-of-sec-845204867.html))

But, a mysterious thing happened after the Kik case concluded, between when the ruling was entered, and the time the case was *fully adjudicated*. Surprisingly, on October 21, 2020, it was announced (subtly, and at the very end of the SEC [press release](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-262)) that all Kik had to do, besides pay the fine of $5 million, and promise not engage in securities violations in the future, was to notify the SEC if and when it planned to sell or transfer any more of their Kin coin holdings for the next three years. Remember, Kik held an ICO. LBRY did not. But, ultimately, the Kin coin was allowed to circulate and function within its ecosystem. It does so to this day. There was no disgorgement, and a fine of “only” $5 million was levied, a fraction of the $100 million raised during Kik’s ICO of the Kin coin.

Can it be said that the outcome will be the same here – i.e. that the Kin coin and LBC coin will enjoy the same fate? Is the SEC more concerned with thwarting new entrants to the cryptocurrency space, making the barrier to entry seemingly impossible to any company considering it? Or, is it all based on “Pay to Play”? Does the SEC realize that once a blockchain is fully decentralized, and the coins have been released into the wild onto the exchanges, for secondary sales, that it no longer has jurisdiction because the coin or token has then morphed, no longer meeting all of the prongs of the Howey test? In any case, the $64 million question is this: “Why did the SEC allow the Kin coin to survive and continue to operate as was always intended by Kik?” Is it because they “paid their dues”? They certainly didn’t back down – they fought the suit tooth and nail. The SEC certainly wants to intimidate, and for all of its opponents to back down. But if these opponents do not back down, and do see it through… is the Kik case one that demonstrates that blockchain companies can indeed engage in innovation, and without “regulatory clarity” be in the clear once it appears that the company lost, only to move forward after suffering the hellish onslaught from the SEC? Let’s hope that Jeremy Kauffman does continue the fight, one way or another, and that LBC can move forward unobstructed, with the LBRY app being able to flourish in perpetuity.","self","https://redd.it/yr1k2f"

So Gary wanted to buy a house.

Should Gary buy the house or charge the builder?

**CASE 2**

So Gary went to look at another house. 

The builder said, ""There only a few houses here now. But I'm gonna keep building more in this area and make nice. Prices gonna shoot up in the future!""

Should Gary buy the house or charge the builder?

.

**CASE 3**

So Gary finally managed to buy a house. He decided to renovate it.

His wife wanted parquet flooring, saying, ""It's gonna make the house look much better! And if we ever sell next time, will fetch a better price too!""

Should Gary renovate? Or should he charge the renovator, or his wife?

However a settlement keeps the momentum going that they want.  On the other hand I would think Ripple if they can get the right settlement would be in really good shape because they would be the only crypto with a clear path with the SEC going forward.

The SEC has filed multiple lawsuits against companies that are acting above board, but held multiple meetings with FTX and never took any steps of legal action.

Also worth noting is that individuals connected directly to FTX made significant political contributions to legislators such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren who is a member of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection.

At this time we do not have all the facts, but I urge you to complete the form on this website to request investigation into this matter.

In case, there will be no trial on the case, what do you guys think will be the settlement terms?

My guess is that SEC wants to forbid Ripple selling XRP to retail. Then they will have to pay a fine (say 50 million) because they did so prior to 2019. That is how SEC will win in this. 

But the retail is free of course trade their XRP with each other (or lend their coins to ODL purposes earning passive income). 

After all, Claus Schwab & Co wants the retail to own nothing but be happy. There is the conflict because I want Claus Schwab & Co to taste the happiness of not owning anything but leasing my XRP in his ODL purposes.","self","https://redd.it/ytw4w7"

&#x200B;

There are speculation that during this weekend there will be some major movement among the banks around the world towards implementing ISO200022. This speculation is based on announcements several banks are making to have some sort of down time of irregular maintenance in the same time during the weekend. It could be just a coincidence if just a couple of banks are having it in the same time, but AFAIK, there are pretty many banks having it now.

I think the deadline for ISO200022 is in March 2023, but some banks are already ready and are able to implement the new standard. 

&#x200B;

What I am not sure is how this is related to XRP. XRP together with some coins are ISO200022 compliant, but does this directly mean the banks will start using XRP after they have transitioned towards the new standard or is this a misunderstanding and using XRP is just one option among the many when it comes to moving the value?","self","https://redd.it/yza7h1"

Hi everyone, 

In this post I will share my thoughts on why massive ODL usage WILL contribute to the massive appreciation of XRP price. 

The way ODL works to facilitate the remittances (or international transactions in general) from currency A to currency B is the following:

1) Use an ODL exchange in country A to buy XRP with the currency A

2) Send the XRP to an address in the ODL exchange in country B

3) Sell the XRP on exchange B to receive currency B

Even though this procedure includes similar buy and sell volumes of XRP and the “same” XRP can be used in the next transaction, here, in my opinion, is the missing point of all those that claim that we will not see increase in price:

The liquidity in exchanges is provided mainly from Market Makers. These people make their living by filling both sides of the trading pair in exchanges and gaining on the spread. In simple terms, they take advantage of buying a lot at a slightly smaller price and selling a lot on a slightly higher price. Doing this long term and efficiently gives them quite good margins. But here is the main point of my thesis: In order to do their job they need to hold large amounts of any coin that they make a market for (in our case XRP and local currencies). They must have relatively a lot of coins to facilitate the orders that are coming through ODL partners. This is a standard procedure for any Market Maker. Every day or week (or other time-frame) they re-balance their holdings to have something close to 50%-50% of the pairs they do business. They MUST own the coins, they can't sell them because that's the tool of their business.

As ODL volumes start to go up a lot, this means the transactions that will take place on XRP-local currency books will be much higher. As a result Market Makers will be more incentivised to Market Make ODL-exchange XRP pairs and more companies-individuals will be attracted to Market Make these XRP-local currency pairs because profits from their CORE business are much much higher. As a result the Market Makers will end up the bigger holders of XRP because this is their business. 

And all this leads to an upward spiral where increased ODL volume leads to more Market Making volumes, which leads to more XRP buying from their side to do business, which leads to the increase of the price of XRP, which leads to more efficient ODL usage which leads to  even more increased ODL volume and so on. 

All this is irrelevant to the speculative increase in price by investors etc. It is the core business of Market Making. 

Thanks for reading. Cheers!","self","https://redd.it/z2nx6z"

&#x200B;

It looks the law suit will not get settled but there will be a trial (timewise it does not make that big of difference as the verdict will come in a few months likely).

What do you realistically think about the outcome - what is the odds for Ripple winning and why?

&#x200B;

Because I am biased and hope for Ripple winning, I feel I have no objective opinion on the outcome... I try to find which outcome is more likely objectively and from the perspective of a judge that looks both sides of the argument.","self","https://redd.it/zboc3o"

&#x200B;

My major concern on the functionality of XRP is the liquid supply.

if you look at the current market cap (40 billion usd including the escrow of Ripple). 

My major question is how can you possibly move trillions of dollars with 40 billion usd market cap? Elon Musk alone can potentially need to move that amount if he wants to buy the next Twitter. 

The big question is from where will the XRP supply been sourced. Who is willing to lend to say Elon Musk 40 billion usd worth of XRP when that represent 100 % of the supply.

Not to mention if you add also other sources of demand for XRP.

&#x200B;

I know I am a bit clueless and newbie here so pardon me my stupid question.","self","https://redd.it/zcbgas"

The Evernode project says its betanet ticked over smoothly into its third epoch. It also notes that the Evernode (beta) Hook has distributed over 10.2mm (beta) Evers without a hitch.  


Evers (EVRS) is the native currency of the Evernode Layer 2 networks, which are issued on XRPL as a way to reward node operators and allow for the payment of node hosting services by dApps.   


According to its roadmap, Evernode will launch in two beta phases: public beta and private beta, before its official launch, which would be dependent on the Hooks amendment. Additionally, for Evernode to come to XRPL, the Hooks amendment must pass a governance vote by the nodes and validators of the XRPL.   


XRP along with GameFi (CosmoGene, Axie, Uplands, LifeBeyond), Blockchain finance and some memecoins is going well right now while the rest of crypto seems to be struggling.  


Hooks add smart contract functionality to XRP Ledger, as they are small pieces of code that allow XRP Ledger accounts to function as ""lite smart contracts.""   


David Schwartz, CTO of Ripple and one of the initial developers of XRP Ledger, discussed his ideas for a sidechain for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) back in September. He planned to make it possible for Ethereum smart contracts to be executed on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), lowering entry requirements for developers.","self","https://redd.it/zhffx9"

So, gaming, meanwhile, is another area ripe for development, as Schwartz said non-fungible tokens can help studios more easily bring users along to their newest products.  


“There are real problems in the gaming space that NFTs solve,” he said, noting that gamers tend to get comfortable in older games and can be hesitant to follow developers into newer products. “You have to start over from scratch, and there's this feeling of loss. If you could take NFTs with you, then you wouldn't have that feeling of loss, and you'd be more likely to migrate to the game that the game studio wants you on.”  


The majority of the p2e/blockchain games that are now available, in my opinion, are complete junk, they are neither enjoyable, playable, nor lucrative. The only games I've been playing are Gods Unchained and  WAM.  


So, I would be happy to see what Ripple has in mind.  


Currently, Ripple doesn't create consumer applications directly, instead, it seeks out partners who can make use of the fast and inexpensive XRP ledger. Additionally, it has a $250 million creator fund, which according to Schwartz is being carefully used after some early hesitation.  


So, should we anticipate anything fresh from Ripple—possibly a game?","self","https://redd.it/zk4uzh"

Remember that AMA with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson a few days ago, in which he revealed that he had heard rumors that the matter would be resolved on Dec. 15. This seems to be where the speculation about the probable settlement came from.  


Since then, the community has provided lots of discussions, including their opinions on what a settlement might mean for Ripple and the larger cryptocurrency sector.  


What do you think, in the end, what impact will this have on Ripple and its price? Do you plan further investment? I've been thinking a lot about it, maybe now is the time for me to check out Fasset and do something about it. Any advice?  


In a Dec. 12 Twitter post, pro-crypto United States congressional candidate January Walker opined that an unfavorable settlement from Ripple would be a “loss for the whole world & WEB3,” adding:  


“The world follows the actions of the USA, and how the government handles one of us, sets precedence for how they handle all of us,” she said while calling for the industry to work together.","self","https://redd.it/zkqlb4"

I don’t think either of them are wrong… There needs to be a new oversight branch that deals specifically with cryptocurrency because crypto seems to have similarities to both securities and commodities/currencies.

According to Buterin, XRP has not apologized for claiming that Bitcoin and Ethereum are Chinese-controlled.  


As far as we know, Ripple's lawyers authored the claim that Bitcoin and Ethereum are Chinese-controlled as part of its defense case in the legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It was to highlight the risks of miner concentration in China which could make the networks susceptible to Chinese policies, as Schwartz explained in August when Buterin brought it up, supporting anti-XRP sentiment within the Ethereum community.  


I sincerely hope that we will soon have a more stable year without any further drama in the crypto market.   
I'm sticking to ETH in the next year as well and I believe that people still hold ETH in extremely high regard because Layer 2 activity, Polygon, and Metis are all experiencing excellent growth that will likely lead to future trends in the year and beyond.   


It's obvious that these metrics are reaching new highs into 2022, so I'm looking forward to seeing all of these huge opportunities that Buterin mentioned earlier in December regarding mass crypto wallet adoption, inflation-resistant stablecoins, and Ethereum-powered website logins.  


It is worth noting that the XRP community is no stranger to these types of narratives and has often had to explain the difference between Ripple, the company, and the XRP Ledger, a decentralized network used by Ripple, institutions, and retail investors. XRP remains widely misunderstood despite being one of the oldest cryptocurrencies, as highlighted by Deaton in November.  


Recall that Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently said that XRP does not provide any technical value, and the community is “toxic and petty.” He further said that he has nothing to do with XRP and will no more comment on anything related to Ripple and XRP.","self","https://redd.it/zvhsz9"

As far as I can recall, XRP is ranked as the third cryptocurrency, immediately after Bitcoin and Ethereum, in LunarCrash's list of the top ten cryptocurrencies for 2022 based on its Galaxy Score.

Have you given it any thought? Does this list assist you to make a decision about your investment strategy for the upcoming year?

Since I previously invested in ETH, XRP is the one I'm curious about, but I'm currently considering CoinFantasy as well as another investment option. To be honest, it's challenging to choose wisely these days, but I won't give up during this bear market, that much is certain.

When it comes to XRP, the token's parent company Ripple saw some tiny victories in the SEC lawsuit, which helped XRP post some sizable increases as the overall cryptocurrency market swung into negative territory. The lawsuit has, in fact, served as XRP's essential component. According to analysts, if Ripple wins the case, XRP will rise in value, and vice versa. After both parties submitted their final submissions, the community is currently awaiting a final decision.

This is a clear indicator that the Department of Justice identifies both CRV and MINGO as Commodities and not as Securities; otherwise they would have filed charges alleging Securities violations and not Commodities violations, as they did.

I see this as yet another point of leverage for XRP as both CRV and MINGO being called commodities would clearly indicate that XRP is alarm a Commodity and not a Security.

Anyway, like many of you I was bummed to see Hogan's final video a couple weeks ago. Whether he was delivering good or bad news, his videos always gave me a sense of sanity. By the start of 2022 when it came to xrp I didn't even bother keeping up with any other news outlets, just waited for the next Hogan drop.

Given that it was his ""final"" one, I thought it'd be nice to have a summary of it posted here to look back on as well as for any new xrp holders who might not know about his channel, so here goes.

Link to video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok1\_xVnRyPE&t=584s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok1_xVnRyPE&t=584s)

&#x200B;

Both parties have filed final replies of the motions for summary judgement. The case is officially in front of Judge Torres (technically she could render an opinion at any time)

Attorney James Filon believes a final decision will be made on or before March 31, 2023

&#x200B;

**The SEC's final brief**

(Hogan notes this brief was better than the initial two)

Summary paragraph:

*“Undisputed facts show that investors paid money for XRP and Ripple stated it would use those funds to promote and try to find use and value for XRP. Ripple also told investors that if it was successful, demand for XRP would increase permitting Ripple investors to profit. XRP investors including institutional ones paid over 2B dollars for XRP because they reasonably expected Ripple and its principal decision makers who had a “giant pile” of or who were “very long” XRP to honor the promises they had made and to do what they were financially compelled to do: use XRP sales proceeds to fund extensive effort to increase XRP’s value.”*

SEC brought up past cases they had prosecuted successfully as persuasive authority, including:

1. Telegram
2. Library
3. Kick Interactive (the most problematic since it was decided in the same court as Judge Torres is in)

&#x200B;

**Ripple’s final brief**

Main arguments:

1. SEC hasn't proven that all alleged sales of XRP involved money
2. XRP was not sold as an investment contract
3. There was no common enterprise
4. XRP purchasers did not rely on Ripple to increase XRP's price

Summary paragraph

*“In short, the SEC is asking the court to rewrite the statutes that define its authority. For the SEC to prevail in its opposition the court would have to endorse the SEC's theory that there can be a investment contract without any contract, without any investor rights, and without any issue or obligations. It would have to endorse the SEC's theory that there can be a “common enterprise” even if the SEC cannot say what the enterprise is or prove any of the elements that define such enterprises. And it would have to endorse the SEC's theory that purchasers could reasonably have expected profits from Ripple's efforts even though Ripple never promised to make any efforts, even though it expressly disavowed any obligation to do so, and even though profits were overwhelmingly due not to Ripple's efforts but to Market forces. The court would also have to conclude that all amici that have expressly said they did not join a common enterprise or expect profits from Ripple's efforts are wrong about their own beliefs and actions.”*

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**Four possible outcomes to the Ripple litigation:**

**1: RIPPLE WINS AT SUMMARY JUDGEMENT**

Hogan and other lawyers believe this is the most likely outcome due to the expectations of profits prong and common Enterprise problem.

The law requires a common Enterprise between the seller and the buyer of an asset and in the state of New York the Revit case is binding Authority. It defines a common Enterprise as one in which all of the investor’s assets are pooled together and the investors all share the risk of profits and losses from the scheme.

SEC has no real answer to this and only spent \~5 pages out of 55 in its latest brief addressing it. From page 7:

*“Investors reaped their profits in the form of the increased value of the token that all investors held and Ripple established a common Enterprise by pooling the funds and using them for its operations including the construction of the digital ecosystem it promoted. This ecosystem was crucial.”*

The SEC has two big problems with that argument:

1. The XRP Ledger had been in existence long before the sales were made so none of the sales money was actually used to build the Ledger
2. The appreciation or depreciation in the token value was based on general market forces and not related to Ripple’s efforts (required by the Revit case)

&#x200B;

Some additional pro Ripple notes:

1. SEC has not provided any evidence that Ripple ever made any legally binding investment contracts to XRP holders
2. Attorney John Denton submitted hundreds of affidavits from actual XRP holders many of which had never even heard of Ripple when they bought XRP
3. The SEC abandoned its expert witness on the issue as to whether Ripple's efforts had any effect on the price of XRP
4. Ripple’s expert witness analysis established that generally (and especially since 2018) the price of XRP moves based on the crypto market rather than on business decisions by Ripple

&#x200B;

SEC’s best evidence that Ripple communicated to investors = Chris Larson’s 2014 interview statement about utility and liquidity growing the network the value of XRP

SEC must meet burden of proof that anyone reasonably relied on that one interview to make a decision to purchase XRP. Given how obscure the interview was, Hogan doubts the SEC will be able to present reasonable evidence of this.

&#x200B;

Two more major pro Ripple notes:

1. Paradigm’s (investment company) Amicus Brief - law firm reviewed 266 legal decisions related to Securities violations.

*“A comprehensive analysis of federal and appellate law reveals that no Authority exists to support the SEC's attempt to transmute the Howie analysis of an investment contract transaction into a conclusion about the underlying asset. In every application of Howie where an investment contract was found there was some identifiable lead legal relationship between an ostensible issuer and the investor providing investment capital.”*

2. One of the cases that the SEC relied on in its reply brief was Davis v Rio Rancho Estates and in that case the court actually held that:

*“There was no management contract between plaintiff and defendants nor were defendants obligated by the purchase agreement to perform any such services and in the absence of a common Enterprise between the parties the expectation of a profit on resale is insufficient to transform what is essentially a sale of real property into the sale of an investment contract.”*

&#x200B;

Hogan has spoken to other lawyers who believe that Ripple may win on this issue on an appeal not at the trial court level but at an appellate court due to the scope of the ruling.

Based on Judge Torres other rulings, Hogan speculates she is the type of Judge that would take the initiative to just go ahead and rule on something as big as this (more on this later\*).

&#x200B;

**2: RIPPLE LOSES AT SUMMARY JUDGEMENT**

A loss could happen for several reasons:

1. Judge Torres decides that the fundamental statutory analysis of whether investment contracts require post-sale obligations is too novel an issue for her to decide and would prefer it went to an appellate court.

Sometimes it’s easier for a judge to rule against you knowing that you will then appeal and then let the appellate Court tackle the issue and then the judge at the trial level doesn't have to deal with it.\*

2. Judge Torres evaluates the four prongs of the Howie test and agrees with the SEC that there existed a common Enterprise because Ripple simply used the money from the sales of XRP to fund its business.

Particularly from 2013 to 2018 there really wasn't much consumptive use for XRP that we have evidence of and it must have been bought therefore for speculative use.

3. Ripple loses on the reasonable expectation of profit prong. The one thing the SEC did a good job of in its earlier briefs is laying out all of the statements, emails, and YouTube videos of various Ripple employees talking about the price of XRP (8 years worth of content). From their brief:

*“The question is whether Ripple lead potential investors to reasonably expect profits from its efforts. That is an objective question answered by economic reality and Ripple's representations not by individual motivations.”*

**Is a loss necessarily bad?**

A loss would only really be bad if it put Ripple out of business, which would occur if the resulting fines were high enough.

Brad Garlinghouse recently said that Ripple has a billion dollars and a ton of XRP in escrow.

The SEC’s initial complaint shows that Ripple was alleged to have sold illegally from 2013 through the third quarter of 2020 1.388 billion dollars worth of XRP. So the worst possible fine amount would equal that plus fines.

Even if Ripple were to be charged the full amount, it could theoretically survive given how much liquidity it has on hand.

**Sales Split**

The judge could also decide that only early sales of XRP were sales of Securities but at some point the sales lost that designation and became non-security sales.

I.e. if only sales of XRP up through 2018 when the on-demand liquidity use case came into being were illegal sales, the amount of sales reduces by almost half.

Hogan highly doubts that a split of sales ruling would happen due to how incredibly complex the framework would need to be. Certain sales of Ripple were made to institutional, others in open market, others were sequestered from Ripple's general funds and separate accounts, some were made to U.S citizens, many were made to International citizens and those sales don't count under U.S federal law.

&#x200B;

**3: SURPRISE RULING THAT RESULTS IN JURY TRIAL**

The Fair Notice defense and Hinman emails

The Hinman emails make an appearance in Ripple’s brief on page 23 but are only used to back up a very specific point, Ripple’s Fair Notice defense.

Ripple took a big gamble by arguing in its initial brief that it isn’t proper for the judge to rule on the Fair Notice defense and that a jury should decide it at trial, then completely stopped arguing about it.

This is dangerous because the SEC has continued talking about it and in their last brief argued that the judge, not a jury, should decide the Fair Notice issue meaning it should be ended here.

The SEC argues the Fair Notice shouldn’t go to trial because it allows the defense to greatly lengthen the trial by permitting defendants to proffer evidence about the SEC's internal deliberations and the beliefs of countless Market participants which would all require rebuttal from the SEC.

In addition, because Ripple would be able to offer evidence about what we the SEC actually did or didn't do we'd have to defend ourselves which isn’t appropriate.

\*Similar to the appellate court appeal, Judge Torres could prefer not to deal with this case and by sending it to jury remove herself from making a decision.

A jury trial would not happen until at the earliest the summer of 2023 and possibly even later.

&#x200B;

**4: UNEXPECTED DECISION (i.e. grants Ripple’s Fair Notice defense)**

Hogan mentions that  unpredictable things can happen in court on occasion. He mentioned granting the Fair Notice defense as an example, but left this pretty wide open in terms of possibilities.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And that about wraps it up. Ideally, I'd hope to see one last Hogan video of him and his wife celebrating a Ripple win and xrp reaching a million dollars per coin. Or, less ideally, if this stupid shit goes to jury trial and there's another decade of kangaroo court maybe the silver lining is we'll get to see Hogan videos again covering those updates.

Honestly, I've been feeling kind of optimistic as of late. I could see the trial ending by 2169, give or take a few hundred years. Seriously though, XRP WILL PREVAIL. God wouldn't have made Hogan if that wasn't the case. See you all on Uranus 😎

It is worth noting that the SEC is part of the executive arm of government. Consequently, the principle of separation of powers limits the power of the courts on its core functions like enforcement and legal action. According to Deaton, this explains why a case against the SEC for calling XRP security will likely fall flat like the petition for a writ of mandamus he filed in January 2021.   


The attorney explains that under the protections afforded by the separation of powers principle, it is at the discretion of the SEC to decide who it sues and the claims it makes. While Deaton says the SEC can be challenged “based on gross abuse of discretion standard,” the lawyer says the court will require hard evidence.  


“Who the SEC elects to sue and the specific allegations it asserts are w/in the discretionary functions of the Executive Branch,” Deaton explains. “You can challenge a decision based on gross abuse of discretion standard (extremely high standard to meet). You need specific evidence of misconduct.”  


To this end, Deaton says an investigation has to be conducted into the decision of the SEC to sue Ripple and the reasoning behind its unprecedented claims. In addition, he says the XRP community will need to get subpoenas to access the emails of high-ranking SEC officials at the time with interested 3rd parties that may have had the incentive to go after Ripple.  


XRP, and GameFi (Axie, Cosmogene, LifeBeyond etc) have been a steady presence in crypto with most other projects still in a difficult situation and investigations like these do nothing to help it.  


“You need specific evidence,” Deaton reiterated. “This is why we need an investigation into the decision to file the case and why it was filed, when it was filed, and how it was filed (the absurd broad allegations).”  


“We need subpoena power to get personal emails between former SEC officials and interested 3rd parties. Was there a quid pro quo? There could be enough evidence to get over the hurdles and meet the high burden and not get dismissed quickly like the Madoff cases, but you need more.”","self","https://redd.it/zyocc6"
